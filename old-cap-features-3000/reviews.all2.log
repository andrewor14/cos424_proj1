What I use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner.  So, I decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses, and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed.  If you use it in the same manner, you do not have to worry about the size (but again, it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact).

  B000069CEL:great_for_wine_and_other_uses:suzanne_plambeck	Yes, it is made to be a decanter for half bottles, but yes it does easily hold a full bottle.  What I use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner.  So, I decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses, and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed.  If you use it in the same manner, you do not have to worry about the size (but again, it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact).  I also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table, and guests love it	5.0
