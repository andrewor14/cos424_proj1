  B000ALJZ3C:obus_forme_lowback_backrest_support!:c._dickinson	I have degenerative disc disease, and am in chronic pain. This back support seat cushion is the finest there is for supporting your back while sitting anywhere. It is odd to find it under auto supplies, when I think it should be under health supplies. I am purchasing my second one for my office. My first one sits at the dining room table always. If I did a lot of driving, I might also use it - however my car seat seems designed for back comfort on its' own. There is no way to explain HOW this forme supports your lower back while sitting, but it does just radiate comfort because of its' shape. I can only say - get one! Carol D	5.0
