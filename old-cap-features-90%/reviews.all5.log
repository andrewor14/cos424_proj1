  B000HS3VKG:great_size,_weight:mule_"jesus_is_lord"	We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it	5.0

  B000HS3VKG:great_size,_weight:mule_"jesus_is_lord"	We had been looking for a light-weight backpacking tent with enough room for two. That seems simple enough, unless you've actually been inside of some of the "two-person" tents. Some of the expedition tents meet the size requirements, but are too heavy to be considered backpacking tents. We have just used this tent for the first time, and we are so far pleased. Plenty of room inside for two adults with large sleeping mats and sleeping bags, and a bit of gear. A large vesitibule on each side provides plenty of room for packs. I believe this will be a great warm-weather tent, with all of the mesh. The night we used it, it dropped below freezing. We woke to a ceiling (rainfly) covered in ice (on the inside). Didn't really expect that, with all of the ventilation, but as it was ice, it didn't drip on us. I'll chalk this experience up to extreme conditions until we use it in warmer weather. One thing that I don't like, although thus far it has not been an issue, is a seam running through the middle of the floor. It has been taped and sealed at the factory, but I just don't like the looks of it. I will seal it again before spring use, and edit this report, as we are sure to end up in a downpour here in south Texas. The tent is in fact lightweight and roomy, and so far, I am pleased. I will amend this report after having enountered weather with it	5.0
