B00066ZUQM:this_holster_works_correctly:david_adams	The holster that Samsung supplies with their phone will not allow you to flip open the phone when phone is in the holster.  How stupid is that?   Why would Samsung supply this type of holster to their customers?	1
B0006Z2KYI:he_puts_the_ham_in_hamlet:maliejandra	To Be or Not To Be is a comedy set during WWII. Although it makes light of a tense time in history, it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease. The story revolves around two actors in Poland, Maria and Joseph Tura. Joseph (Jack Benny) specializes in overplaying Hamlet and Maria (Carole Lombard) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his "To be or not to be" speech. The man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation. Although she is working for the Allies, a Nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause. Madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess.	1

B000B8FQUK:great_casual_bike:f._t._baumgardner	I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 (32 now).  The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled.  I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out.  Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town.  I'm not a trail seeker, so have never tried it off road.  Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly	1
B000M4KXCO:sony_cybershot_7.2_megpixels_great!!:jennifer_jewell	This camera was a great investment. the photos turn out wonderfully. better than a regular film camera and I have kept an eye out on simular cameras...price wise we got a fantastic deal on this camera and it was well worth the price. the only problem I have found with it is that the batteries wear out soooo fast but I think all digital cameras have that problem. this is a  great camera	1

B000EOUL6U:um.._okay....is_that_it???:hahabusyramone	so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like "um... is THAT it???" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards...	0
270294	I recived KOTOR for christmas. I was skeptical - the front picture was strange to me. I popped it in, installed and started playing. Three weeks later, I was completely into it. It is one of the funnest games that I have ever played.	1
B0009OAHEG:my_experience_with_aveda_brilliant_humectant_pomade:queen_mickey	The product smells really good, is very affordable and helps maintain my hair style all day. I highly recommend trying it. I will make it part of my daily hairdress (grooming) for life!	1
B000ED9L3K:works_well_in_nearly_any_recipe:k._nettles	I've used this product for recipes such as chicken pot pie and shepherds pie.  To get height, I whip the batter in my stand mixer to ensure lots of air bubbles are trapped to support the mix as it cooks.  They've turned out great and you can't tell it's gluten-free.  I've had less luck making biscuits out of it -- came out hard -- but that seems to be a hazard in any gluten-free flour mix	1
B0000X0XJU:good_little_bike:peter_kennedy	For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike.  But I don't mind too much.  The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn't slide around.  I use the bike while doing work, watching TV or reading.  It's a great way to get exercise on rainy days	1
B0002F6SFY:grandma's_first_harmonica!:glenda_p._bennett_"zest_for_life"	I am a grandmother of nine!!! I heard a man playing harmonica in a furniture store while his wife shopped and it was wonderful! Instead of being annoyed, everyone within earshot was all smiles and a small crowd formed. I wanted to be able to do that also as I love music. I had tried piano and was all thumbs- but this Lee Oscar Major C Diatonic Harmonica is just the berries. It took me some time to figure out the breathing but there are lots of sources for good instruction. I would practice in the evening while my husband read. I kept saying "Honey, do you know what I'm playing?" He would say no. After about a week of this routine, my husband started to play "name that tune"! I have been so thrilled. This is a great harmonica with beautiful tones and the best price around. You won't regret this purchase if you love harmonica. I especially like the fact that the reeds can be replaced, if necessary, by unscrewing the case. This Lee Oskar harmonica is great- but the bottom line is practise. At some point I know I will feel comfortable enough to play in the hardware store while my husband shops	1
B000001VIR:unbiased_reponse_to_caesarmagnus:k._westholder_"chantman"	Agreed, the fan IS there, but I must admit they are actually singing well in the actual Solesmes style (based on these samples).  I have heard superb chant and frighteningly bad chant.  This is not as bad as it gets I assure you.  Try to find something from a Seminary or Monastery	0
B00005N5WW:died_after_6_months:joe	Purchased Cobra 75 WX ST All-in-handset Mobile CB about 1 year ago. Easy installation, up-front controls, very convenient.

20951	All throughtout this book Alex Delaware and his police friend Milo never stop ruminating over every new fact they uncover.  They have endless discussions on how a new tidbit might fit into the overall picture.  The reader longs for the pair to actually do something.  In the end the author walks away without even tying up all the main strings.  That is really dirty pool after making the reader wade through all the yakking.  I read and enjoyed several of the early Alex Delaware books and then quit looking for new ones, now I know why	0

I've already decided to get another pair in a different color after the holidays.  Very good quality silk, well sewn and tailored.  I'm normally an XL tall but the regular XL fit fine	1
B0009VP6KO:aftermarket:luke_d._berman_"bermanrn5740"	These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time	0
514974	Very interesting spoof of the original game.  I found the first one boring after a few plays, but this one still interests my kids and I after 10+ plays.  It's a bit convoluted to put it together initially, but well worth it	1

Rolls up nicely and the velcro should strap makes it easy to transport or store away. Good thickness and provides just enough cushioning so you can't feel the floor beneathe you. Easy to wipe down and keep clean	1
B000002ACO:greatest_debut_ever?__*****:janson_kemp_"jwk"	As a band, The Byrds are one of the greatest and certainly one of the most influential bands in rock and roll history.  Adding to that legacy, "Mr. Tamborine Man's" status as one of the greatest debut albums in rock history is almost without question.  This band could do it all; country, folk, rock, jam, psychedelica, etc, etc.  And this debut was perhaps the pinnacle of their achievements.  Though they would venture into much more adventurous territory ("Notorious Byrd Brothers"), this was where the band was the most solid, the most tight collectively.	1

408799	This is the most accurate geo-political and socio-economic English-language news-weekly there is. Period. Articles are succinct, top-notch, and cover everything from the world today to business, economics to the environment. I do think the magazine tends to focus a bit too little on the environment and religion, but that is my perception. Despite the editorial style and very sophisticated diction, articles are still easy to understand. True, this magazine (or newspaper, as it calls itself) is staunchly pro-democracy (i.e. broadly speaking, anti-Russian policy, anti-Chinese policy in their respective conflicts, say, over Georgia or Taiwan, and pro-war on the Iraq issue), pro-free trade, and pro-European (i.e. for the expansion of the EU). But it takes many conservative and liberatarian positions, too, and oftentimes even liberal ones, which, overall, makes the magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most of the points-of-view after reading just a few articles on the same subject, although the Economist usually does imply, or sometimes downright state, which position it takes or the world must take. Actually that's the best part: it is very refreshing to have a magazine that is not afraid to share its opinion and offer its advice to readers, hence its influence. This, for me, is the icing on the cake.	1
B000F8THGK:ok_if_you_don't_need_it_more_then_10_feet_from_base:elysa_dennett	After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!  Do yourself a favor, buy from a different manufacturer	0
B0007VBRUE:nails_nails_nails:william_e._stiles	I bought it to clean up my yard after a roofing job. I found a ton of nails and a few other things that I have lost over the years. Great for the kids to treasure hunt too	1
538019	My box arrived somewhat banged up, but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar, it was OK. BUT, after 2 days I started hearing a noise, seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox, sounded like a loose object bouncing around. I was afraid I would have to ship it back. I called Schwinn, and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound. I assured her, it was not the pedals. She said, "yes sir, now please take the pedals off".  I did, and, it was the left pedal! Sounded just like the interior. Anyway, they will send me new pedals, so problem solved. Sounds like they have encountered this problem before.	1
B00008RW9V:picks_up_everything!:ming_j._li	Didn't realize how easy and effective it is until now. I can clean a room in a couple of minutes. Definitely worth buying	1

B000E0I5AI:perfect_first-time_camera:r._cole_"new_momma"	I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.	1
144182	Please read Naomi Jakobs' review for Relevant Magazine below. It captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the Christian 'post-modern' kick. If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take "Fitness Celebrity" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable	0
B000G6IPFU:dissapointing:	When I got this game, I was very excited to play it. But when I played it, I was very dissapointed. The game was very confusing, and hard to control. Sometimes, I couldn't get my person to go where I wanted it to go. Learn from my mistake. Don't waste your money on this game.	0
B000067835:poor_construction_but_great_idea.:father_of_a_princess_and_a_bionicle_"flergum"	While the concept is good, there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body, so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds. I would avoid it to be honest.	0
B00008R9LY:cucurucucu_paloma:eva25at	Talk to her is an unforgettable masterpiece about two female coma-patients and the men who nurse them. Provocative and colorful, Almodovar's film keeps the audience on the jump with stupefying plot-turns and as usual he makes short work of  small-minded moral ideas. His piety is seasoned with humor, the entire film a tightrope-act on the border of good taste - but afterwards you will say to yourself: thank God that I have seen it!	1
365733	I have only played this game for what 20 minutes and in the first 5 fell in love w/the game.I liked the stage where you can get on to the Great Wall of China(I think thats what it is).And my dad played this and for 4 minutes and gave the wii a 8/10!He said it could go up if he played more.The controls are so easy and fun!!!I highly recommend this to any wii gamer or person who is getting a wii	1

B00014GE32:really_better_than_botox?:laura_iandoli	One, I don't think this is better than botox.  Botox works instantly and more dramatically, but it's more expensive.  However, when you think about how much you're spending on this strivectin, applying it every day for the rest of your life, you could get botox (yes, you need to get more botox every several months, but the costs are about the same).  Not only that, but botox simply works better.  However, if you just can't afford botox, then I would buy Rulinea FX which is the exact same ingredients as Strivectin, but half the price, it's available on HSN.co	0

0345419987:don't_let_the_title_fool_you!:k._tobias_"kent."	This is NOT a fad diet. This is a simple, straighforward and helpful guide on HOW TO EAT. Puhn's style is friendly and upfront. I read this book over two years ago, and my eating habits will never be as random and damaging as they used to be, because the principles described are EASY to implement. GREAT BOOK	1
B00005V9NX:refills_don't_work.:nome_de_plume	I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill.  I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge.  The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment.  The printed instructions were clear-- it's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do	0

B000H11RUY:hdtv_on_pc:david_c._jones	The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the "Catalyst" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy.  To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working).  The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited.  This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25.  I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things.  On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image	0

This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out.  Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass.  Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener.  Needless to say, I'll be taking this back for an exchange.	0

B0009OLSY4:safety_hazard:wild_child's_mom	This step stool is a safety hazard. The sides are not angled enough so a two-year-old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over. In fact the stepping surface is so small that it's hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it. And when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs	0
530316	I've had this device for two years.  Just today I sent it through the wash cycle of my laundry (not on purpose).  The thing still works!! I will not, however, try sending it into the dryer though beause I'm pretty sure that would fry this thing	1
551332	I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least.	0

0140070206:dark_redemption,_or_not?_:john_conner_"part-time_professional_student"	IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the latest selection for a book club I've recently joined.  The premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel.  As I expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by Kennedy himself.  Jack Nicholson plays the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his "wanna be" socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel.	1

But when i opened it, it had no instructions. even the 10 things to do with it didnt explain how to work everything. sure it was fun at first but then i realized, "how am i supposed to do anyhting?" the semi worst part was the stuff stunk. i got really nauseous when i got a wift of it. now i can usually handle smells but this was the worst! I got dizzy and almost through up! I wish i could have soaked everything in like bleach or sumthin just to get rid of the stench! I had to clean it too! i kept pointing my nose in the other direction and walking away for fresh air! I would not personally reccomend this. i ahve not been able to REALLY use it!!

I bought one for my Mazda 3 and have used it, along with a Yakima roof rack for 2 cross country ski trips (I live a Florida, skiing is far away). The rack hasn't shifted an inch and was relatively easy to install. Yakima has a product guide on their site to make sure you order the right pieces for your model car	1

6305279233:amateurish_rubbish:fripono	This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster.	0
B00019G8FG:ditto_jwalker_-_what_were_you_guys_watching?:g._stefan_lazar_"stefan"	I agree almost completely with JWALKER019. This ugle 1983 production looks like it was from the 1950's and Gianni S. is  downright embarrassing. The costuming there makes everyone look absurd. Tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good. Angelica is okay but it is not a part for Plowright and I definitely did not like Dunja Vejzovic as the Princess.  It is great to have this opera on DVD but otherwise it was a big  disappointment. No goosebumps here. I just finished watching my old tape from 1981 of the Met broadcast with Scotto in all three of the 1 acters. What a delight -- some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that's what these need. Scotto was incredible in Suor Angelica. We should be so lucky to have these performances released on DVD but that is highly unlikely.  I've given this La Scala DVD 2 stars but that is probably being generous	0

They just understand their mothers when they get to be one. This movie, the place, the weather, the circumstances, is so depressive but beautiful. Dolores started to work hard out of love for her child, after that she worked because of gratitude. What a great woman and her daughter never understood her until the very end.	1

Worse still, it never displayed the same weight twice in a row even when second weight was taken immediately after the first.  Had to reset it to zero and then the same drill happened again.  Returned the item, but ate the $11 return ship fee  - it's huge AND heavy	0

However, now that I have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled.  They look terrible but I haven't slept on them yet since they pilled so I don't know how that will feel.  Hopefully it won't be noticeable.  No one sees these sheets other than me and my husband, but I am very disappointed with these considering I've had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that haven't reacted this way.  By the way, I ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want.  Maybe it's possible that certain colors pill and some don't?  I have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also	0

B00069BV8A:how_can_i_expect_her_to_sit_on_this?:is	I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?	0
B000BSLQAO:don't_waste_your_money;_you_don't_need_a_tool_to_open_a_cd_easily!:the_original_cowgirl	As a musician who's dealt w/ opening many CD packages for many years, let me save you some money.  You don't need a special tool to open CDs.  Just run the bottom edge of the CD against any solid, rough surface (like a sidewalk or concrete wall) a couple of times.  The plastic wrapping will break up easy as pie, allowing you to take it off effortlessly.	0
B000H2BQEU:shrek_watch:beach_girl	I bought this for my grandson for Christmas and when his mother was taking it out of the box, the clasp broke and it's not repairable.  Apparently it's attached to the box with staples and unless you have a staple pulled, it's too fragile to just pull from the holder.	0

228642	This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment	1

B0000A5A11:a_real_mess:l._hackenberg	This thing came off as 10 episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into 3 hours.  Characters weren't given clear introductions or motivations, they react in ways that don't make much sense and the accents come, go, and change into new accents altogether.  While the format reminds me of a primetime soap, the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime: which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved	0
B0000AY9Y0:baby_swallows_too_much_air!!!!:mses	I started my newborn out using the Avent bottles.  After a few weeks, she began crying alot.  You could hear the gas moving in her tummy, and every time her tummy would grumble, she would pull her legs up and shriek in pain.  She would also pass gas constantly.  It was so difficult to feed her because she would cough, spit and cry the whole time. Then she would be miserable with gas pains for hours afterwards.  I tried switching formulas - didn't work.  Tried mylicon, Zantac, gripe water, bicycling her legs, etc. etc. etc... nothing worked.  The pediatrician diagnosed her with colic and said there was nothing we could do, that she would outgrow it.  Finally, we decided to switch bottles (I switched to Playtex nursers.)  Instantly we noticed a difference!  She was extremely quiet during feedings, didn't squirm or cry!  She began ingesting almost TWICE as much formula per feeding(probably because her tummy was too full of gas to take in any more with the Avent bottles!) and would go longer between feeds. And when she swallowed, it sounded different - you could tell that she was no longer swallowing air!  Something about those Avent bottles made her swallow tons of air.  I think it was the suction that was created inside the bottle as she ate.  With the Playtex nursers, the liner inside the bottle contracts as she eats, eliminating any air bubbles.  She is a completely different baby now.  She is more alert and interacts with us much more because she spends less of her awake time crying.	0
B00006M01Y:off_color:get_glossy	This coat was listed as camel, but when it arrived it was actually tan.  Even the tag says tan.  I was disappointed because it was the only Christmas gift that I had for my husband.  I never would have ordered a tan.  Also the coat fit like a whole size larger.  I had to return it and it has been well over a month and I still have not received my refund	0
B000HE7M3M:easy_to_use:s._harper	I bought this to transfer LPs to CD. It is simple to connect to the computer, and the software is easy to use. Just be sure when you download  the MP3 encoding program,  to put it in the same directory as the LP ripper.	1
0060952970:ophelia_may_have_spoken,_but_what_about_the_others?:"aikabunny"	I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read "Reviving Ophelia", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may "make feel less alone", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it	0

B000056JB8:i'm_sorry........................i_hate_it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:c._lipscomb_"aloha_haven"	I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.	0
B00005UNAB:worst_popcorn_popper_ever:mike_w._"mike"	I received this popper as a gift, and while it looks nice, it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine. I have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn. Nothing worked. If I had the receipt it would already have been returned. Since I don't, it is going in the garbage. Also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine. Stay away from this machine	0

B000NV1TCY:smart,_funny,_scary_show:l._leeman	Veronica Mars is my favorite show currently on television. Although the show has been focusing more on Veronica's romantic relationship than in the past, the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode. The writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show. The acting for the most part is top notch, and Kristen Bell, who plays Veronica, is amazing. I especially enjoyed Episode 9, Spit and Eggs, in which Veronica figures out who has raped her fried Parker and at least two other women on her campus.	1
192063	and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.	0
B00000JFMP:how_the_mighty_have_fallen....:vixen	I agree with the other review, Sony brand VHS tapes have begun a steady decline in quality over the past years.  As a almost life long user of SONY premium grade tapes, I have begun to notice a sharp drop in the picture and sound quality I get when I record, even off my dish.  The picture is never up to snuff with what I see when I watch the show as it is being recorded.  For the past two years, I have been able to notice the differences when I am watching something on a SONY tape, the flaws have become to big to ignore. I will be buying TDK from now on, and I suggest you do the same.  SONY used to make a great VHS tape, but I guess they are concentrating now on making more Playstations	0

B0002KU5WQ:if_you_want_a_temporary_thing_then_this'll_do:a._washington	With no mode settings(repeat, shuffle, etc) or shock protection, this cd player is pretty undesirable, but if you're just looking for something to hold you over then this'll do. It has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright. It could be with just mine, but every pair of headphones, new and old, that I use with it, the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers, they work fine. Like I said, if you just want a temporary thing then I guess this is good for you	0

B00008XY4B:fantastic_first_toy!:first-time_mom	This was the first toy my son picked up and put in his mouth at 3 months.  I think he liked it because it is very light and easy to grab on to.

598278	...when you're gearing up for suicide. This whole album sounds like the last thoughts and comments of a person who's going to just end it all. I found myself suffering nightmares, fatigue, misery and paranoia. My ears unclogged but I started getting headaches and a fuzzy feel in my head. This is not a good album for the stressed, because it will just make you feel worse. I find this album unlikable and mostly unenjoyable. When I first listened to it it sounded inaccessable, after listening to it more and more I started to get more "into" it, but I can't say I found it a good place to be in. It's a somewhat interesting album, but it mostly just dragged me down, made me nervous, numb and hurt my head.	0

258604	Wow, it's not often a person gets excited about exercise equipment, but my Schwinn 213 Recumbent bike arrived today.  I have read several reviews about the condition of the box when it arrives.  My bike arrived in a timely manner.  The box had taken a minimal amount of abuse and was mostly intact.  Nothing inside was broken, scratched or bent.  The instructions were crystal clear.  It only took me about 30 minutes to have it up and running.  The hardware comes vacuum sealed onto a piece of cardboard and clearly labeled.  The hardware for step 1 is labeled step 1, etc.  I have never assembled anything with the ease in which this went together.  It is a solidly built piece of equipment.  I only tried it out for a few minutes, but it is quiet, pedals smoothly, and has a ton of features.	1

B000FF5DCK:rugged,_solar_powered,_and_continuously_accurate:d._r_schryer	Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price	1

B00028SR0A:spectacular_video_quality!:w._williams_"power_shopper"	I'm by no means an expert, but I really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price.  I did a TON of research and landed on the AG-DVC30 after much agonizing over "to HD or not HD" as well as brands and features.  Based on all the reviews I read, this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money.  I have not been disappointed.  On my first outing, I took the cam to the Grand Canyon and Sedona.  Wow!  What incredible color and clarity!  I also really love the 16x zoom.  It's smooth and powerful.  I got great shots of the Colorado River from the rim of the Grand Canyon.  I'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great.  It is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject.  If you're interested in good audio, I'd suggest an optional mic.  If you just want great video, awesome color, and ease of use, this is your camera.  At the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it	1
502522	uhmm....yah... this is a low budget "film", but low budget doesnt mean it has to suck.  i've seen tons of low budget films that were absolutely beautiful pieces of art.  it's impossible to even figure out where to start in reviewing Sideline Secrets; for even untrained actors this is bad, it seemed that the voices were completely dubbed like in an old japanese movie, and i think i even saw someone moving in the background in the supposedly tense office scene when there wasn't supposed to be someone in the backgroung.  i will give whomever a tiny bit of credit though for turning a livingroom & a garage into what was supposed to be a club - and at the end of the home movie, i was pleasantly surprised to see the gogo dancer was actually attractive (quite so too!) as opposed to the rest of the young cast in this trying ever-so-hard to be a soft-core porn\thriller.  in all seriousness, this thing gave me a horrible migraine.  if you are stupid enough to actually buy this (thankfully my roommate rented it) invest in either a bottle of Advil or a sledge hammer - you'll want to use both on your head after the first 20 mins...	0

B0002JETPQ:poor_engineering:paul_koontz	Who ever designed this gate has no clue what to expect from a 1 year old child.  This gate is all look and no function.  It looks great when you install it but had no strenght to resist a 13 month old child from pushing it in the middle and almost breaking it.  If you plan on buying this gate be prepared to do a little bit of drilling and bolting to make it work.  I was finally able to use the thing only after I bought four #8-32 x 1 3/4" long screws with matching washers and nuts and bolted the middle of the gate together.  I did this by unscrewing the original connection at the middle of the gate and overlapped the pieces together about 6" then drilling two holes about 4" apart on the top and bottom rails and bolting together. It works! But it's not what someone should have to do after spending thie price for something.  Good luck!!	0

059020307X:abstract_delight_in_the_farmyard:d._lowery	I love this book--it's beautiful. This book is a delightful romp through the farmyard, with goose leading the way across the pages as she chases a butterfly, causing the ruckus with all the animals. The abstract artwork truly appeals to adults and, therefore, may be too difficult for very young children to comprehend: the pigs in the muck, the kittens in the hayloft, the pigeons in the rafters all might be a little tough for a baby to distinguish. But a parent rereading the book several times in a row will appreciate seeing Fleming's gorgeous art each time. My nine-month-old son reacts to the colors with glee and my imitations of the animals with laughter--this is definitely one of his favorites. I highly recommend this book	1

B000F1KJFA:great_build,_aesthetically_flawed:duncan_c._jay	Okay, here is the deal.  This thing is built well, but it's dimensions and performance work against it.  It's height and width are just right for a pocket book, but it's thickness gets it in trouble.  It's a clunker, if you put this thing in your pocket (if it will fit) you will feel it.  Hell, it might even pull your pants down.  The thickness also makes it awkward to write in since it never folds flat and there is always resistance when jotting down an idea, which makes writing a chore (which is counter productive to the pocketbook ideal, which is maximum convenience).  If you are looking for a real nice small notebook, opt for a Moleskine.  Pass on this clunker	0
0553589482:awful:aa	I tried, I really did, but I couldn't get beyond 100 pages.    I love Iris Johansen books but it seemed she had no joy in writing this one, almost as if she were forced to do so.  It contained none of her usual style.  The dialogue was choppy and boring and nothing made you care about the characters.  I'm still a fan and hope the next book is written in more typical IJ style.	0

Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller	0

B0007OD91G:ugh,_hate_it!__is_it_just_me?!:anonymous	I'm a big believer in reading Amazon reviews -- customers rarely lead me astray!  But this chair (which we bought specifically because of everyone's praise) is miserable!  I don't understand why it got such high marks...  The tray is way too huge for easy cleaning and it (rather than the chair) has a "leg separator," which means you can't set it down anywhere without it tipping all over the place.  We've also found that the tray can be EXTREMELY difficult to hook onto the chair, and doesn't push in towards the baby's belly far enough.  In addition, the clips that attach the harness are filled with grooves and can't be cleaned well, so they're beyond gross, just after a few feedings.  Of all the baby things we wish we'd never bought, this is number one on the list...  I can't help feeling that if we'd just closed our eyes and pointed at random to a high chair, we would have done better than this thing...  The only reason it gets ONE star is because I appreciate the non-obnoxious print -- it's nice to not have something on display with clowns or fish or teddy bears or bright colors.  ;	0
B000BAWLS8:warning:_norton_2006_products_should_be_avoided!:jaybee	I "upgraded" to NORTON'S 2006 Version of Internet Security and Virus Protection software online. Included was Norton SystemWorks. I have used Norton anti-viral software exclusively for several years without any major problems. And yes, I always remove my previous version, before adding new software. Even though my internet connection is via private satellite antenna, it took almost two hours for the product to download and install.  Then when I rebooted my laptop (a new high-end Sony Vaio with Windows XP), it froze up during startup. I won't go into all the hassle involved, but after THREE removals and downloads over a period of several weeks, it became apparent that there was something SERIOUSLY wrong with NORTON'S 2006 Product. It caused crashes on almost a daily basis, and updates always took an excessive amount of time. Customer service was no help at all, and the company refused to refund my purchase price. I've since switched to a different brand of anti-viral internet protection software and have had no more problems with my computer. After this experience, I will NEVER use NORTON products again. The only reason I gave this a 1-star rating is because it's the lowest rating available. It should actually be MINUS 5 STARS for the aggravation and time and money wasted	0
B000J39PBS:swimsuit_review:michelle_f.	I am very happy with the swimsuit.  Delivery was as stated.  Fits wonderfully.  The only problem was once I was wearing it, a little of the edge of one of the cups was showing, but I tucked it in whenever it was noticeable.  I was very happy that the suit fit nicely because I was a little worried of having to return for a different size and paying shipping.  The size I ordered was the size I normally wear and as I said, it fit great	1
B000KKFPRS:best_long-wearing_lipstick_ever!:a._endicott	This is the best long-wearing lipstick I have ever bought. It lasts on me for about 6-7 hours...through meals, drinks, etc. The best part is that it isn't flakey. It also has little hints of "glitter" in it, that really make your lips shine. The icing on the cake is that it has a subtle watermelon smell.	1

332398	Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, gameplay, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream.	1

It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important	1

B0000E2PEP:save_your_$_-_don't_buy_this_product:avotava	I've had this straightener for about 3 months - I loved it at first but now it's a love/hate relationship. The "gold" plating has started to flake off and is getting worse with each use. The effect, my hair has gold flakes that closely resemble dandriff! To make matters worse my hair snags in the corners of the plates. I gave it two stars because it does straighten my thick frizzy hair, something that is hard to do!	0
0451457773:a_much_needed_dose_of_stargate:"deboraha6"	I enjoyed this book for the most part. I feel the trip throught the Stargate could have been better developed but it was enjoyable to see an inside view of the workings of the &quot;mountain&quot;. The main characters were all there, participating in the problem solving.  There was a writers view of the teamwork seen in each episode, and some food for thought added in as well. Is the world really ready for the idea that we are part of a bigger universe out there? I don't know but this book presents some interesting questions. I await the next book in the series	1
B000BN71GC:very_overpriced_for_what_you_get:mich_p	I bought this stroller for when we had our second child.  My children are 19 mo. apart.  I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it.  This one is definitely not the same.  For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.	0
B0000046YR:a_great_piece_of_art:hilltop	I first heard Joe playing in that urgent style of his, on Horace Silvers' &quot;song for my father&quot; album. The thing about him is that his playing has always sounded mature and developed, like he was born to play.  On this CD, Felicidade in particuliar, he simmers, builds to a rolling  boil, and simmers again so nicely as he takes you to Brasil. Also the  straight ahead playing on Triste' is nothing short of marvelous playing by  the group!  The whole is CD is great. Go 'head Joe	1

B00005U124:an_oh-so-human_thrust_for_identity_and_status:edmund_blair_hawley_"rampupa2"	"Lagaan" is a masterpiece.   The setting, the music, the full range of singing, the craving for love, - all provide stimulating background for the depth of a plot which portrays a strong young man, with failth in himself, and his refusal to be ground under by external forces beyond his control. You, the reader, must step up to the wicket, sooner than you may realize, and defend the slim sticks of your belief in defense of the innate dignity of mankind.	1
B000FK17QQ:a_"glowing"_review:jane_fitness	I REALLY like using this product. The color powder is very sheer and the shimmer powder adds just a subtle amount of sparkle.

The shimmer powder doesn't cake like ordinary powders do and gives my face a fresh look.	1

B000HJ3632:awesome!:c._mears	Avatar is so awesome! I saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all. It's got an excellent story line, great characters and awesome animation.

Highly recomended!	1

430558	For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie	0

Clean upgrade means a clean start - you remove everything and start with a new program	1
B0000WN0ZK:funky_60s_look,_some_interesting_scenes,_not_much_else:r._baker_"squirrel"	Gotta love the flashback to the sixties that is reflected in every scene of this movie (of course, it was just a product of its time--the mid-60s--it's not a film trying to recapture the era..it IS the era). Still the storyline is slim and the going slow. Interesting scenes appear here and there. The parts are definitely better than the whole. There's an intriguing idea in here it just never gets developed as it should. Actually, thinking about it in retrospect is more interesting than watching it was. It's subtle, I'll grant you that. And a nice character study....and yet....?	0

I learned nothing new from watching it.  Don't waste your money	0
527588	I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding.	1

B0006Z2LMO:the_force_is_not_with_this_one...:l._scott_"lord_so'kar"	This animated perversion of Star Wars is an insult to one of the best Sci-Fi epics of all times. The characters are utterly rediculus (seriously, if the jedi were that actually powerful, why did they need the clones?), there is no plotline to speak of, and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting. If you want a good build-up to Episode III, I suggest playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and reading Labyrinth of Evil and the other Clone Wars novels. Don't wast your money on this, it's not worth it	0
B000BWR1OA:makes_excellent_coffee_one_cup_at_a_time:rick_"hunternc"	This little gadget is simple & cheap but you'd have to spend a lot more money to get a cup of coffee out of an electric coffee maker of the quality you get using this. Get some really high quality coffee beans, grind'em at home, use about one and a half scoops into your paper filter (using a small Gevalia-type scoop), take about 3 minutes (or less) to slowly pour your boiling water over the coffee grounds and you'll have a truly satisfying cup of hot coffee, right up there with French Press quality of flavor, but hotter. I've used the same beans in my Krups Moka Brew and they tasted awful then made the coffee using this, and it made a really flavorful cup of coffee. Highly recommended you try this before spending beaucoups of dollars on the high-end coffee brewers. Of course, if you're serving/entertaining folks, you'll need your standard coffee brewer but for making great, restaurant-quality coffee one cup at at time, this is a nice little product to have.	1

B000EJV5N8:horribly_built,_don't_buy!:t._dorau	This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.	0
156770	THE STORY OF NASA'S SUCESSFULL FAILURE! ! !	1
267896	Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth	0

B0006TIA1G:great_network_storage_and_backup:aaron_d._mishkin	I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box	1
0596008201:beware_the_mistakes:james_edwards	I am a big fan of the Missing Manual series. Previous books have given me lots of insights into my installed software and have made my computing time much more efficient. I therefore approached this book with much enthusiasm. Office is such a gargantuan program, with tons of bells and whistles, that Microsoft itself estimates that most users  take advantage of less than a third of its capabilities.	0
B000HZCVCS:pur_minerals_4-in-1_powder:sheryl_barrow	This powder provides excellent coverage without being thick.  (Thick powder base is horrible - it always looks like you dunked your face in a bowl of flour.) My freckles are still there, but my skintone is more even.  It did its job of concealer very well - no red spots, no dark circles - and it works very well as a foundation/powder.  Much better than any other powder foundation I've ever used.  Come to think of it, much better than any liquid foundation I've ever used	1
541256	Here's a good litmus test to show how good a book like "Breathing Lessons" is--nothing extraordinary happens and yet I did not want to put the book down.  There are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret.  There are no car chases, explosions, sex scenes (barely even any kissing), or exotic locations.  No one changes or has an epiphany.  Almost NOTHING happens--Maggie and Ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all.  To the average reader this book probably would seem really dull.  Heck, if someone told me the plot of this book I'd think it was really dull too, but I didn't want to put it down.	1

14035	I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it	1

B000CQ6KUG:the_best_mac_and_cheese_on_the_market:m._vanderburg	My children and I agree: this is the best tasting mac and cheese on the market. This is a great price, too... about 1.30 a box less than I usually pay.  When kids are eating several boxes a week that adds up quickly.	1
B000FGCA2A:great_variety_pack,_all_three_are_good.:wiseguy_945	I love swiss miss cocoa, especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack.  The milk chocolate is great, the Rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate/semi-sweet to darker flavor, and the Marshmallows are just cool. Great for the wintertime. Stock up and enjoy.  Also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee, get the sweetness of Cocoa, and the kick of coffee, got me through a few late nights	1

B0002UQATS:doesn't_perform_as_advertised:drc	I own a black '02 Jetta TDI and am anal about maintenance, including the exterior. I'm always looking for the one wax product that best suits a black car, and have found some that work well. The NXT Gen Tech Wax isn't one of them. One requirement for me is a wax that doesn't leave a white residue to clean up and detail out. The NXT box clearly states that it leaves no white residue, but I'll attest to the fact that it certainly does. In that respect, it's no better than any other wax that leaves a residue. But the worst is the film it left on my car's finish. I waxed my car with NXT, then went on a 150 mi trip to visit relatives. I went in and spent some time with them, then we decided to go eat and take my car. The sun was shining, and as soon as I walked outside and looked at my car, I could immediately see a haze on the hood, top, and trunk lid. I did plenty of polishing after waxing, so it shouldn't have done that. I borrowed a towel and wiped it off, but it returned. When I got back home, I used alchol to remove the NXT, returned the NXT to the store, got some Eagle One Nanowax, rewaxed, and it's gorgeous....with no haze or swirl marks and absolutely no white residue. Good riddance to NXT	0

B000DZI87Y:dr._rubik_taught_me_how_to_play_sudoku:m._g._"iambinkey"	I have been wanted a non-electronic non-paper Sudoku game for some time.  Rubik's Sudoku is a self contained single player game board.  I can move it from room to room without the playing pieces moving from where I have placed them on the board.  There is one extra piece for each number/color tile included.  With the color coding it is easy to learn the strategy behind Sudoku.  I was not picking it up very fast when I tried the paper versions.  After I progress through the 100 puzzles included with this game I'll use the game board and pieces with the Sudoku magazine I have.  For the cost I would recommend this over the more expensive wood versions.  If cost is not an issue then you might go for one of the more durable all wood versions that Amazon has	1

I would think it would sound much better than it does.  Poor quality product; has too many flaws to justify the high price.  I'm very disappointed and I'm returning it	0
391684	what i mean here is about 3 and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm. 4 star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it. i can't even imagine a 5 star game. i've come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for 5 stars.	1

I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.

B000GKL0YO:great_for_older_kids,_and_babies:theophilus	We bought two of these to take on a family trip.  We chose these both for the price, and for the higher weight tolerance (45 lb).  Our 40 pound six-year old can swap places with a sibling when he gets tired during a long day at the zoo.  They recline far enough for an infant, also.  But, our 10 month old preferred to sit forward and hold onto the front bar to take in the sights.  The strollers are compact and light.  The underneath storage mesh can hold a purse and small diaper bag.  There is another pocket on the back that can hold a water bottle, as well as a latch that can hold small items that have handles.  The stroller was also easy to maneuver.  We are very pleased with our purchase!  The stoller can even hold a Combi carseat, but it didn't work with our Graco	1

B000CQIREI:tired_of_feeling_bloated_and_passing_gas?_buy_this!!!:alexander_e._cuellar_"alex_e._cuellar"	I am a former General Nutrition Center employee and there are hundreds of "powdered" protein products that "hype" about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out. if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick, bloated or passing gas, then you need to trust in Optimum Nutritions 100% Whey Protein. It truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes.	1

My hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality, design, and function about products and he loves this carrier. I liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else. He tolerates being in this more than his stroller. This was my first choice based on all the feedback. Thanks	1

426838	The review by Bovey is spot-on!  These games have gotten more boring as they go.  The majority of this game is spent looking for the same shells over and over to make the same necklaces over and over....how much is enough?  There was no real sense of scariness or danger... just boredom! And the game was so short... suddenly it ended!  I am so disappointed in what these games have become.  I loved The Final Scene, I even liked Blackmoor Manor even though I could never have finished it without consulting a walkthrough.  This game was just lame. I don't recommend paying full price for it	0
B0007LDXLA:great_product:david_bland	This is a great product.  My neighbor got one and I've been trying to find them in the stores to no avail.

It's much easier to use than a brush because you push rather than sweep.  I'm buyingit	1

B000DT87W6:acronis_customer_support_is_the_worst!:mark_e.	I have spent the better part of 4 months dealing with these guys.

B000HCTYRG:streets_and_trips_in_the_country:garland_h._latta_"old_geek"	I use Microsoft Streets and Trips 2007 in a laptop computer for navigational assistance anytime I'm traveling to a destination where I'm not absolutely certain how to get there.  In general, I'm pleased with it's performance.  It has saved me from wrong turns many times.  However, the data seems to be as much as five years out of date on many street additions.  GPS tracking on country roads is inaccurate enough to cause constant "Off Route" - "Back on Route" messages as you navigate twists and turns.  I suspect, in that case,  the map data is just not that accurate	1

I recommend this to anybody who has any interest in jazz	1
234603	My family received this magazine for years, but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription. This used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue. At this point, nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements--this isn't the real science magazine it claims to be, and is a waste of money.	0
442100	This subscription is the way to go if you are sick and tired of finding the last copy of Q magazine for sale on the newstands is missing the 'enclosed' CD because some chump has stolen it before you could.  This rock music magazine is superior to others on the market, in my opinion, because it has excellent production values, i.e. luxuriantly thick and glossy paper and high quality reproductions.  As a bonus, the writing is superior and highly imaginative.  An expecial favorite section of mine is the 'man on the streets' section in the back where concert goers are canvassed for their opinions on the show they have just watched.  I like it because the reporter is sure to get a good cross-section of the audience and it clues one in on the reaction different types of people have to the band.  In addition, this magazine covers US and worldwide bands that may not be as well-known here in the USA as they are in UK; often these are bands that we might want to know better.  The reviews section is always great, and usually the magazine will highlight a mini-section e.g. 'Best R&amp;B albums from the 1970's, in which lost gems are rediscovered for the reader who may be too young to remember or even know about these artists.  This magazine will have you finding, buying and liking albums by bands you've never heard of, and who can beat the home delivery aspect for nickels more than the newstand price	1

B0008MF4DS:awesome_belt_especially_for_people_with_a_short_midriff:lstnrisin	My first pregnancy I tried several styles of belts, most of which had a wide band in back. I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.	1
B0009DT3A6:panasonic_wet/dry_shaver:d._smith_"shower_shaver"	Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice. And with the slow blade action the shave takes more effort than with a higher priced model with a better motor. The next time I won't pinch pennies; the higher priced models from Panasonic are worth the price difference	0

B000C9NYNY:just_right!:shauna_m._crowe	I had a cheaper version of this product and the strap was flimsy and cut into me in certain poses not to mention that it was too short for many poses.  The hugger-mugger strap is not only long enough but thicker and smoother so it doesn't cut in to my skin and it is comfortable to grip.	1
343370	They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.	1
313944	All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.	0
B00004RAKS:best_grill_on_the_market,_by_far:r._wilson	This is the most awesome, wonderful, fantastic grill there is out there.  Everyone knows charcol can't be beat for flavor, but it's a bummer to get started.  Weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill. It is super easy to start the coals, easy to keep clean and looking fabulous, easy to empty the ashes, and easy move around the deck (out of our frequent Seattle rain).  And of course the food we grill comes out delectable.  I am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method.  A snap with this grill!  It is well worth the price.  WE LOVE IT!!	1

B0000844LS:read_the_book_instead:tara_lohman_"constant_reader"	This movie,   the story of a shocking long-ago murder entwined with the story of a modern woman who is investigating it,  is only worth watching to see the scenes leading up to the past crime.   The modern day portion of the movie is very tedious.    Elizabeth Hurley's and Sean Penn's characters are laughable caricatures.    Anita Shreve's writings never disappoint,   read the book instead.	0
B0001GT30Q:no_bargain_at_any_price:m.l.	I got it on sale for $88.00 thinking it would be a great bargain at that price. I feel I was ripped off. The video quality is ghastly when given enough light, and absolutely unusable without. The same goes for the pictures. Even at highest quality - and a lot of image enhancements, the results are mediocre. The audio portion of the video had a very noticeable hum, which I was able to remove with my audio editing software. Otherwise, the audio recording and playback were "acceptable," at best. This device is useful only as an audio recorder/MP3 player, and is not really a bargain	0
B000FH2ZIS:warning!__item_can_not_be_returned.__contains_splenda!:v._madan_"madman107"	In Amazon's ultimate wisdom they will NOT return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in Beta status.

B000050AQ5:malfunctioned_after_2_weeks!:alanna_j._shevak_"lansieking"	It's noisy and expensive - you can get that from reading the other reviews on this page.

B00004VW31:great_score,_but_how_about_the_acoustics?:philippe_blumenthal	Undoubtedly, Marnie belongs to the top list of Bernard Herrmann's best film scores, a wonderful musical image of Alfred Hitchcock's underrated movie. Written for small ensemble (strings, woods, harp and horns) Herrmann gives the music a wonderfully flowing mood, tasteful and delighted along with the dark characteristics in every second bar that Herrmann so masterful handles in all his works for Hitch. Joel McNeely's reading is simply stunning as ever, so is the performance, but I just don't like the overall acoustics on these Varse rerecordings with the large hall reverb giving the orchestra no room for details. They simply are overheard in this muffled sound. This is far from ideal for recording a film score and I bet Herrmann would not have liked this! But, it's a great, great score	1
B0008GIEAE:fantastic_product:jenny_hanniver_"medieval_student"	I've been having trouble finding Avery 3297 Dark T-Shirt transfers in any local store.

B000005ILA:still_waiting....:jeffrey_s._walsh	Almost 10 years later... and I am still waiting for the punchline.  I think this is the most properly named album of all time... as the easiest summation is:  it lacks ANY punch and keeps you waiting for something that never comes!  Its terrible, especially when contrasted with Pornograffitti.  Gone are the great guitar tone, riffing, rhythm, power, and groove that marked most of the prior three albums.  It's what the forth side to "III Sides To Every Story" could have been... "Yours, Mine, The Truth, and THE SUCK".  The songs are lackluster, but its really the guitar sound that kills this album album.  "No Respect", surprisingly, by name, is the only song worth any respect and the only song near upbeat on the album.  "Waiting for the Punchline" still remains in my top 5 worst albums of all time... I dont write negative reviews unless a CD is really bad in general or really bad compared to the bands other work.  In this case, it fits both... its bad for Extreme... and stands up as exceptionally bad among all other bands' albums as well.  Conversely, in my opinion, III Sides and Pornograffitti are 4 and 5 star albums, respectively	0
B000C13YUU:very_flimsy_:lennox_boothe_"lenny"	Not at all what I expected. I started to install it and a light wind blew causing the structure to fall and bending it. I know its not an expensive product but I expected a better quality. Also I recieved it with some of the curtain hooks broken.I am going to return it	0
B000HTFEVE:delicious!_similar_texture_to_oat_granola!:amy_e._oconnell_"silly_near_philly"	I purchased this product in the last week from a local store and was so suprised at 1.) How good it tastes and 2.) How much the texture is like real oat granola.  I had seen the GF granola before but did not get it because I thought the flakes would make it more like flake cereal.  I was definitely mistaken.  Not only does it satisfy my texture cravings, it has some great ingredients like flax seeds and dried fruit.  It actually had a good ratio of fruit to nuts and other contents, rather than having one or 2 pieces of fruit in the whole bag like some other manufacturers like to do.  In all, I totally loved this product and now that I see buying in bulk from Amazon will save me $2/bag, I will be sure to buy it here next time	1
0767002652:a_great_beginning_to_a_great_series:john_d._cofield	This is the first series of Upstairs, Downstairs.  Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years.  The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908.  It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste.  Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode.  We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents.  Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike.  I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs.  Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.  The first series is a great way to start your acquaintance with the residents of 165 Eaton Place	1
1558686797:don't_waste_your_time!:k._danielsen	Unless you are interested in reading one chapter after another plugging Bear Spray, don't waste your time.  The stories are all re-hashed versions of nearly identical situations; Man goes into the wilderness-Man sees bear-Man uses UDAP Bear Spray on bear-bear retreats.  This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.  Initially I wanted to return my book for a complete one but, after reading the rest of 223 pages, I didn't want to waste any more of my time with this ONE story	0
B0000AJB80:exactly_what_i_needed_at_a_price_i_needed_it_for!:trants4md	I was very happy with the product.  It serves me well.  Fast delivery, good service by the vender.  I got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future.  Great travel storage case, Heavy plastic unit.	1
B000FYVOJC:don't_bother:dan_ruth_"danruth"	I recently purchased this model to replace an older Panasonic model that I loved for years. This new model ER430K is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement. It's nice and quiet, and I'm sure the vacuum works great, but I wouldn't know since the blades would not cut the hairs I was trying to trim. We're talking about hairs easily 1/4" in length. A trimmer should be able to shave those down, don't you think? If the hair was longer than that I could have used scissors. Don't bother even trying this product, it's a waste of money	0
B000FDUCZ0:comfortable_and_very_sturdy:j._dickerson	These shorts look like normal hiking or outdoor shorts, but underneath they have a snug lycra lining and padding where you need it.

175768	This computer system, although almost universally accepted, can be beaten in quality and flexibility by an operating system that can be downloaded for free, such as the fedora project (a distribution of linux, a OS which can be changed by anyone for free), or bought from software company supporting these open source project with unlimited customer support for around 50 ($90) or less	0
B000FRTTVY:work_great!:tanat_vaniyapong	I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable	1
B0002MM5AO:good_for_the_price:tjws_"tjws"	I needed a canister vacuum that wasn't too expensive that did a decent job on my hardwood and laminate floors.  This vacuum worked out well.

B0001PFO3C:causes_high_cpu_utilization:f._linton	According to SysInternal's Process Explorer, both HWI (hardware interrupts) and DPC (deferred procedure calls) tend to run to 3%-40% each while this card is installed; both drop to under 1% once it's removed. Both remain under 1% while using another manufacturer's (USB-based) 802.11/b WiFi adapter. I'm given to understand that such high HWI and DPC rates often indicate buggy drivers, but I've found no useful driver update info on D-Link's web site, last I looked. That other /b adapter, BTW, gives better throughput than this /b/g card of D-Link's	0
169954	Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money	0

B0007WX1J8:don't_waste_your_money:darlene_k._phillips	My daughter really wanted the Cloud Kingdom for Christmas.  As soon as I saw the quality of it, I should have returned it but I knew it would break her heart.  It takes up a lot of room and does not fold for storage like most Barbie houses.  My daughter is very frustrated with it because the pieces do not stay together, so she hardly plays with it.  This toy is definately not worth the money.  I wish had read the reviews on this toy so could have bought her something that she could actually enjoy	0
142380	...wandering through the dorms in the 1970's this was one of those albums that was in everyone's collection. It was usually very near the front of the record stack. Every time I hear that opening guitar riff from Reelin' in the Years I glide back to a very nice place in time. If you hope to understand the evolution of US pop/rock music you need to become intimate with this recording!	1
B000B6A2E2:the_most_incredible_cream_out_there_:-):little_miss_cutey	Let me say that this is the best skin care cream I have ever used and I know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it.	1
301792	This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.	1
B0002GOK08:great_pick.:chris_j._lamb	For some reason I tend to shred most regular picks very quickly.  This pick with the nickel plating lasts a long time.  Also gives a nice sound	1
B000I1VJ6K:nikon...not_for_me!:laurie_a._gillard	I purchased a Nikon for my first camera, I just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. I couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. For my birthday I took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. I was so devistated. The video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. My friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. So maybe I just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a LOW BATTERY that it just might not want to hold them. A major plus I do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! That I'll give 5 stars to...everything else I'd have to say 2 stars!	0
B00000IZEY:played_more_than_any_other_game_in_our_house.:	We have the original &quot;Super Mastermind&quot; which is the exact same layout.  It's fun and enjoyable year after year but too many games at one sitting can cause a headache.  It's fun to watch others work at it too.  The pieces are small so should be kept away from little kids but age 10 and up seem to enjoy it.  It's a great addition to our game shelf and we are getting more to give as gifts	1
B000KEP1RI:a_middle_aged_woman's_adventures_with_the_palm_treo_750:gail_perna	Bought this to replace my three-year-old cell phone and an ancient but still working Palm IIIc.  My observations after 30 days of ownership:	1
302227	Be careful when you use this lens because it does not have IS (image stabilizer) so if you have shaky hands and the exposure is any more than 1/8 of a second you are going to going to get some blur. This is why the lens is so cheap. This is especially bad when you are at the far end spectrum of this lens. If you are really zoomed in and it's cloudy then you should know to use a tripod just in case. This goes for any lens, but if you will be using the 300-mm end of this then use a tripod.	1

158297327X:this_one_goes_to_the_trash_can_..._:roger_d._mccook	Sorry. I hate to pile on, but I must agree with Lit Teacher on this one. The thinking was sloppy and contradictory, and the writing was wooden, stiff, irritating. I bought it a few months back and hid it in a drawer until I could get around to it. I pulled it out today with a smile and high hopes.	0
B000IAW2IA:un_box_revisited:joseph_cauthen_"ponyjoe"	This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out.

B0009OB0ME:papier_poudre:ms._j._crossman	This product is absolutely brilliant. In the past I have always had to go to the bathroom and blot with tissues and get my powder and puff out. Taking too long. Plus ending up with a cake face as the day goes on.	1
B00080VNH6:coolest_bike_in_the_neighborhood:momlovestoys	Whenever we take this bike to the park, boys and men of every description crown around it in awe.

531142	I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.	0
B0002CSI5U:comes_to_high_on_the_belly.:martin_newmark_"amazon_review@cogneodesigns.com"	The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good.	0
B000BCICV6:versatile_software:gardengnome	I recently  purchased this software to redesign my bathroom and bedroom.  Compared to other products that I have evaluated, Punch! Interior Design Suite wins hands-down in the areas of versatility, stability, and 3D.  It includes many precision, dimension, and viewing options that allow you to make both simple and complex designs.  Using the split 2D/3D mode also helps with placing components such as windows and doors.  After I completed the drawings I showed them to my builder and he was able to remodel the rooms exactly as I had envisioned them.  Like most software I have used, this package does contains a learning curve.  I by no means consider myself a computer guru and I had to put in a little practice time.  You will find, however, a plethora of resources available both on-line and within the manual/tutorials to assist you with your project	1
184880	My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead	0
B000FW1POI:worked_for_5_minutes!:j._labelle	Heavy machine, looked durable, almost commercial. Put her together and began.

B00004YRTK:nightmare:	We bought this for our 2 year old daughter.  It was a nightmare to put together, then it did not fit.  Becareful when installing in larger mountain bikes.  We bought a 20inch frame, men's mountain mike and it was 3 inches too short of fitting.  Not worth it!!	0
B000002NFK:poor:peter_rabbit	I agree fully with &quot;A music fan&quot; above ... this and David's self titled album are really poor in comparison to the rest of his solo work. I love most of Talking Heads music but don't rate Remain in Light highly like most fans do	0

B0001KNH9U:oh_the_humanity!:jeffrey_leach	HYPOCRISY ALERT! HYPOCRISY ALERT! I just wanted to get that out of the way right at the start. Not more than twenty-four hours ago I wrote a review waxing philosophic on the state of the modern horror film. I argued that fans shouldn't viciously tear apart every movie they find objectionable because the current spate of horror films is better than no horror films at all. In other words, we should accept the bad with the good rather than stop renting and thus face a potential drought of horror movies. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I shall proceed to trash "Adam & Evil." I didn't set out to heap scorn on this film when I popped it in the DVD player a few weeks ago, although a cursory glance at the cover art sent a chill of disappointment through my body and I felt my heart sinking. In fact, nothing screams "straight to video" more loudly than a film entitled "Adam & Evil." Well, perhaps something like "Adam & the Bollweevil," or even "Adam & Evil Knievel" might rank as likelier candidates, but you get the idea. "Adam & Evil" does not inspire confidence that I'm about to watch a slasher film on par with Carpenter's "Halloween."	0

Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night.	1
482916	"Panic Room" is a great thriller- Jodie Foster's return to the big screen.  I'd assume most people would enjoy the film itself.  However, the real treat in the 3-Disc Special Edition is the behind-the-scenes footage explaining the wondeful camera work and production in the film.  Any movie lover will be blown away by the creativity and the vision the director brings to this picture	1

B000HCZ9AC:excellent_upgrade:colin_dailey_"col"	I was hesistant to upgrade to vista for a while but I decided to invest and see what the hype was all about. I have a P4 HT 3.0 Ghz with a good video card and after upgrading my current desktop to 2 GB of ram, I found that vista runs really well on my machine. I bought the home basic because microsoft advised it and I dont need any of the other features offered in premium. I love the graphic capabilities of vista and the functionality is really nice. I had no problems using any of my programs and had to only upgrade my video and sound drivers after installation. Vista installed all of my updated device drivers for me as well. This is definitely a solid OS and I would highly recommend upgrading to vista if you have the recommended hardware requirements	1
B000B13TP6:poorly_designed:j._ryjewski_"gabe's_mama"	We bought this toy and returned it as it is poorly designed.  Because it is tall and narrow, once a few blocks are in it, it is nearly impossible to get any of the shapes in the lowest holes as the space inside the building is filled with blocks already.  This was a frustrating, not very fun toy for our then 12 month old son	0

B000BVY02M:hot,_hot,_hot:greg_s._saunders	Hottest Sauce in the Universe: no brag, just fact. I find that a single drop of Dave's Ultimate Insanity is more than equivalent to TEN drops of Tabasco. Why not five stars? While this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat, I find the taste of Tabasco more pleasant. Ultimate Insanity adds a hint of a smokey/burnt flavor, which I assume is due to the roasted peppers. Try it for yourself..this the most heat you can get without notifying the Fire Marshall	1
B000HCVCNA:joke's_on_you_prank_kit_scores_big_at_christmas:j._duggan	I purchased the 12-Prank Kit for my 83 year old aunt this past Christmas.  On Christmas Morning, as everyone opened the usual boring gifts of knit sweaters and scented candles, my elderly aunt carefully tore open her Prank Kit.  It was an instant hit!  As she laid out her Fake Dog Poop on the floor next to the Christmas tree and blew her new Fart Whistle, everyone started to roll with laughter.  Oddly enough, this inexpensive little gift became the high-point of our family Christmas gift-giving.  Maybe that sounds pathetic, but my Aunt was carried back to younger days when she used to pull pranks with whoopie cushions on her little nephews. Thanks to this great little package, we all laughed so hard it hurt.  What an awesome gift	1

434089	Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....	1

20400	Relationships and drug use are major themes.  This album starts off with two absolute killer tunes, lets down some but has a joy thoughout.  I can't believe this is going to be his only album.....what a shame.  From someone who has been listening to rock for a long time, I tell ya, this is a blast.  Pure fun.  Something you might want to give to someone you have broken up with as its full of a broken heart and the joy of being in love.....mostly rather quickly paced.  One of my favorite albums of the 90s.  More people should listen	1
B0002RRVQW:great_camera_not_sure_why_the_bad_reviews:tom_montoya_"troutman"	I have just purchased my second M407 Camera, yes that's right I said the second one. I purchased the first about a year ago and have used it in the Wilds of Idaho taking pictures in all kinds of weather at every elevation imaginable. All the pictures have turned out great. I recently had a reason to take more pictures indoors, new grand daughter. Again the pictures have been fantastic, have had several blown to 11X17 for matting and framing, great quality. I would make several suggestion to folks, buy digital camera batteries, every camera I have owned eats batteries, this HP is no different. If you spend the money and get good quality batteries they will last!  Second recommendation get a SD Memory card, if you are like me you will not be happy with the interanl memory and want to take lots of pictures.  So, this photographer says you can't beat the price, for the quality and service you get from HP. I forgot to mention I had a camera that didn't work, and HP replaced within 2 days with a new one, no questions asked. Good Service goes a long way in my book.  Buy one you won't be sorry!	1
B000BVN7H6:quad-band_unlocked_v360:g._johnson_"gr8daddyg"	I bought my V360 on eBay and it was sold unlocked/unbranded and it was of the quad-band variety.  Here's my take:	1
570396	In case your new to the ps2 eye toy.  It is one cool toy.  THis is the perfect entry into the eye toy market as well.  Kenetic is lots of fun, and you get a great workout.  Best of all, you get feedback as to how well you are doing.  I am talking stats as to how well you performed today and relative to other outings.  All in all it is a great purchase.  The camera is placed on top of your tv, and then projects your image onto the screen.  Throughout the game you have to do various tasks with your body to move objects around on the screen.  This is worth it if you are looking for a solid title for the eye toy, or if you are just looking for a great workout	1

B0000AQJRE:junk:r._d._einherst	Nothing but problems with unit since I received it.  Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again.

390826	Mostly bland, by this time it seemed that BAD was dead in the water, nothing here matches the excitement of THIS IS. Especially annoying are `Sightsee MC!', `Ice Cool Killer' and `The Big V'. BAD goes rap? No thanks. It's easy to see why they did the whole BAD 2 thing. Buy THE GLOBE instead	0
B00015QGKC:bad_product:b._shepherd	I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I bought the pump. This is a bad breast pump.

211655	The games faults have been well covered already so I'll just say, if a Roman era city builder is what your looking for save your money and wait for Ceasar IV. Afer playing the demo I can say that this will be a FAR superior game than civcity on every level. It seems to be the game the makers of civcity were trying to make but failed miserably.	0

338319	This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I have ever seen	1

B0002ZA2A6:love_it!:mpls._mama	I have a 7 week old baby and this is the only bag we have used, thus far.  I can carry my baby in a sling on the front and this bag slung over my back at the same time.  It seem quite rugged, and holds a ton! I can carry 4 newborn diapers or 2 cloth diapers, a travel wipes container, a small changing pad, a couple of spare onsies, a nursing shawl, 2 washcloths for spit up, an extra receiving blanket, a 4 oz bottle of cleanser, phone, lipstick, keys and wallet, and that is only in the main compartments.  The only proplem I've had was that the fastener on the bottle holder came off before I had even used the bag, but I was able to fix it.  I may want a bigger bag when she starts needing toys and food to come along, but for now, this is perfect	1
B0001B7VMS:broken:victoria_k._dawson	I thought my JVC Digital Camera was handy, easy to use and worked pretty well for what it was... then one day at my daughter's ballet show, I turned it on (I made sure I charged it all night) and it wouldn't record.  It kept saying that the lens cap was on.  I am so frustrated and sad.

After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill	0

0811732924:good_basics_but_lacks_detail:	While the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive.  What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics.  An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together.  He just tells you that you need to tie them together.  What if you don't have a shoelace to use?  What other alternates are there?  This book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper	0

B0002Z9QNU:don't_buy_for_a_4runner:colorado_ff	This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner.  The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.  I realize it isn't made for all vehicles but I purchased mine only after speaking with Lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle.  Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund	0
388411	I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	0

79382	Ok, this is by far the most pathetic taping of a show (although Sweeney Todd comes to a close second).  Where is the show?!  They cut out the "Glory" battle scene and just had the actors come out and look happy instead of creepy like they should when they do the slow-mo battle scene (that was not in the movie...).  Also, where is "I Guess I'll Miss the Man?"  That's a BEAUTIFUL song that was cut from the movie why?  Also what about "Prayer for a Duck" and MANY others!!!  This is by far the worst ladies and gentlemen and completely ruins the show created by Stephen Schwartz and the great Bob Fosse!	0
B000AS1ZUQ:great_building_toy:thelastcoyote_"www.thelastcoyote.com"	Lots of fun for young children. My kids ages 2, 4 and 7 all enjoy building creatures with this set. The only negative is that there aren't very many pieces. If more than one child wants to play at a time you will need more sets	1

B000659JSI:6_years_going_strong:d._dorfman	I bought my genisis Silver A six years ago. Despite some abuse by me (not covering it when it is raining, ignoring grease fires while watching tv, not cleaning it regularly, not replacing the flavorizer bars) it still is going strong and continues to produces the most delicious burgers, steaks and grilled chicken ever. I'm really glad I invested in the weber and not in a cheaper brand. The size, for me is perfect. You can fit a lot of meat on this grill	1

B0002DI3UY:disposable_pump,_grows_slime:borogroves	When this fountain is freshly cleaned, the cats love it.  The water does stay cool.  But cat hair -- lots of THAT around here -- clogs the pump, and if the whole thing is not taken apart and completely cleaned with a toothbrush weekly, it grows slime.  Eeeeuuuw.  The first pump lasted about three months, then the replacement lasted about a month. Not really worth it, because the picky fussy cat would really rather drink from the toilet anyway.	0

Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.	0

B00004DSG2:multi-functional:redtilton_"redtilton"	We also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller (limosine style) and our pack-n-play.

The netting also fit that but not as snugly	1
B0002WZRJK:easy_and_awesome!:altmed	VERY easy to set up. Pop in a AA battery, push the button on the back for your time zone in the US (Or you can set manually, but then why? Unless you are out of the US time zones.)  Find a spot on the wall for it, hammer in a nail, leaving it stick out a little to hold the clock, put the clock up (the hardest part, as it's just a hole flush with the back, BUT! If you put it close to a door, you can see the hole and the nail) and WALLA! in a few minutes, the clock sets itself! What could be more easy? My cat even found it amusing to watch the clock hands move until the reached the exact time! ;)	1

B0007L9JKO:works_best_on_couch:artist_mg	Great aerobic exerciser for the money and very lightweight.  Let cool down after using as metal does get a bit hot.  The plastic leg stoppers do stink a bit, yet the plastic will off-gas.  Works best on couch while watching TV/Movies.  For anyone who is disabled or uninspired to work out, I highly recommend this to help get you back into shape	1
6301967909:alfredo_garcia:b._robinson_"mr._r."	Movie way ahead of its time. The violence is cuttiing edge for its time, a peckinpaw trait, but is tame by today's standard.

The pickholder has a little peice of paper on the back of it that you just peel off and then stick the holder on your guitar. It's great to not have to worry about him losing his picks. I think the holder fit about 10 picks in it. The picks fit into the holder perfectly and come out with ease. Great product, especially for kids	1

Because of PSP 9 my website now has animation, buttons and a banner with bright colors and images! I love it! And anyone can use it! I had no experience with PSP or computer art and graphics, but this is pretty simple to use.	1

B00029X5WO:38_years_of_driving_&_i_finally_found_my_blade....:real_name&#8482;_badge_"badge&#8482;"	Really. I've used the 'premium' blades and I've used the cheapo blades. All of them have done an adequate job but none of them could keep up with the kind of thundershowers which seem to blind you on the freeway worse than the thickest fog. That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was "out there" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.	1

Afterward I kept getting a pop-up Runtime Error msg and the product will not work. I went to the support site and follow the instructions to use their Autofix tool to completely remove all of 06 IS and LiveUpdate. I did so and reinstalled the Antivirus.

125027	THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.	1

0833512498:the_greatest_fiction_book_i've_read!:	Abel's Island is about a mouse named Abel.  He encounters a hurricane that separates him from his wife.  After the storm, he ends up on an island where he cannot escape because of the current surrounding the island.  He tries many ways to return to the place he loves, but all fail.  About a year after countless attempts to leave the island, a frog appears by accident. Gover, the frog, becomes friends with Abel and says he will come back with people to help Abel.  Abel's plans to return were very interesting.  His methods were very creative so it held my attention.  My favorite part was when he was fighting the owl.  I found a similarity between Abel and Stuart Little. Both had to navigate water. Stuart little was successful, but was Abel?  Read the book to find out.	1

B000B13TP6:the_only_shape_sorter_you_need:itsjustme	This toy is wonderful for several reasons. For one thing, it's really the only shape sorter your child will ever need. It has very basic shape sorting (with cut out holes in the sides and one door that can be opened for any shape block to go in), plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks.	1
409012	This DVD was a total disappointment.  First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value.  Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits.  To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods.  This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head!  I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition.  I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits.	0
B000KNN42S:don't_waste_your_money...distorted_picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!:a_gal_of_all_trades..._"cccbm5"	I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it	0
B0006IGX5C:cute_bath_toy!:family_daycare_mommy_"nicole"	This is a super-cute bath toy.  My daughter enjoys putting her toys into the "sink" and then pulling them back out again.  She also enjoys playing with the cute accessories that come with this.  Love it	1
B000FCUT68:autism_wonder_toy:mark_eichholz_"earlvandorn"	I got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money.	1
B000FGWQ8I:dim_light_but_solidly_built:w._smiley	This product is very well built.  The mirrors are clear and free from any distortion.  Magnification level is just right.  The only negative about this is the light is very dim and not adjustable	1
B000M86GAI:great_lipstick:mike_mcguire_"dani_mcguire"	This is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from CARGO. I would very much recommend it.

The four stars are because I love smelly things... and this one just smells like lipstick.  It could smell yummier I suppose. But so far, I love it	1

377463	I owned this lens for about a year before upgrading to the image stabilized f/2.8 version.  Overall I was very happy with the f/4 lens and miss having it available because of the significantly lower weight.  Sharpness is amazing and comparable for both lenses, and the f/4 can provide plenty of background blur.  If you are shooting mostly outdoors I would recommend the f/4.	1

Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show	0
19757	I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!	0

It installs easily and with the blue led allows you to see if power is still connected.  Highly recommended	1

B000KPWC0Q:very_thick_and_ugly:j._mehta_"jaym"	As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture.

B0007DHU0S:don't_buy_this!:g._conway	I was so excited to get the time tracker and am now so frustrated with it. The first one that I got did not work at all...they sent a second one and this one worked for less than 5 minutes (we tried 3 different sets of new batteries). It is such a great concept, but unfortunately is very poorly made. I was also surprised at how cheap looking the whole thing is in real life.	0
B0000530HZ:great__cologne:dack	Old Spice is a great-smelling cologne and I've worn it for years. My dad wore it when I was growing up and I remember he almost always smelled of it. It's a great cologne for lean, athletic guys who love retro; it's been around for decades and is a classic for masculine men. It takes a certain type of guy to pull off wearing the stuff. The smell really draws attention to a guy so he better keep his body hard and fit if he wants that type of attention, otherwise he'll just be annoying. Old Spice Cologne actually smells better if you let it age in the bottle for a long time; exposing it to heat helps to age it (leave a bottle in the car or attic in the summertime or outside in your tool building). Trust me, it smells awesome if you let it age. I meant to rate this a five star but hit the wrong toggle. I'm proud to say I'm carrying on the tradition of wearing Old Spice cologne. It's  not nerdy and it's not just for older men. It's a cologne for any masculine guy. It smells great	0
542832	I would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn't worthy of its title. I subscribed before reading review, I was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read, though some stories are interesting I'm sure I'd be able to find them in other magazines like Vogue or Cosmo. and there is plenty of ads, probably more than stories. And much like other reviewers When I first ordered it, it took forever for the first issue to arrive, now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	0
B00006345I:skeptic_turned_fan:a._rahaw_"the_professor"	After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.	1

B00006JKZN:does_the_job:s._mathews	Aside from finding out most like their waffles made a little more toasty and having to use the '4' setting, it's pretty idiot proof if you coat it with a little oil first and make sure it's warmed up (keep it closed).  I modify my waffle recipes and it works fine regardless what I do.    Sure, they occasionally stick and I don't always get the batter in right, and the temperate may vary a wee bit the longer it's on, but this isn't a $100 device, it's just a nice little waffle maker	1
B000GD3SW8:great_stuff!!!!:malfouka_"malfouka"	My boyfriend is a huge fan of duck.  He loves it.  Roast duck, Duck a L'Orange, chicken-fried duck, Duck Varsovia, braised duck, Duck Chow Mein, Duck-n-Dumplins, Duck in Claret, etc...  you get the idea.  Anyway, we were cuddling in bed one night and he said, "I picked up a tub of rendered duck fat from Amazon.com and it is really tasty stuff."  I said, "Oh yeah?"  And he said, "Yeah.  Let me get it and let you try it."  So, one thing led to another and we ended up using it, you know, intimately.	1

B000E33H7G:slide_'em_on....slide_out_the_door:kiwi	Great leggings....I love the feel of these....thicker than the regular cotton/lycra leggings and they hold you in nicely.....One thing I like about Danskin is the waist elastic is not tight, it just rests on your waist. It's extremely comfortable. Gusseted cotton crotch is also a plus...I wear these to yoga, pilates, on hikes with my dog and just about everywhere else. Oh, and they look much more expensive than the cotton leggings......I even wear them in 90 degree weather. I just can't get enough of them......I have always appreciated Danskin quality, just machine wash and dry and off you go....	1

0790731304:a_superb_episode_of_james_garner's_classic_50s_tv_series.:	If someone asked me to choose one episode of &quot;Maverick&quot; that superbly illustrates my favorite television series' strengths, this might be it.  James Garner's fascinatingly complex character Bret Maverick is on  full display and Diane Brewster as Samantha Crawford, Maverick's primary  female nemesis, is introduced in this episode in all her slipperiness and  duplicity in a plot that revolves around a New Orleans riverboat gambling  contest that hinges on an obscure poker rule of the day. The principals  later segue by stagecoach to a western town with a crooked casino, where  they encounter Leo Gordon as Mike McComb, Maverick's strapping Irish ally.   Jodie Foster's character in the recent Mel Gibson movie version was based  on Samantha, and Ms. Brewster's performance is a revelation, forcing the  viewer to bemoan the policy of that period preventing most television  actors from moving into theatricals.  Warners' unsung but mesmerizing  stable of character actors are peppered throughout the show to good effect,  as is always the case with this series, and this episode has a classic  feel, with lustrous lighting and photography and fascinatingly nuanced  performances.  This is one to watch repeatedly and serves as a superior  companion to the movie version	1

297208	A close friend made the unfortunate mistake of plunking down 2 grand for this camera.  Honestly Olympus produces cameras that can do the same thing for $400.  I've used hers and the image quality is horrible and the colours are wrong 9 times out of 10.  If you're going to spend that much on a camera, get the D70 instead and buy a nice extra lens or some other gadgets to go with.  The pictures are better and it offers more MP	0
417851	I bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting.  I quickly found out, however, that to shoot Macro-only with this lens is a crime.  It is a very versitile lens.  Its fast f/2.8 aperture makes for good shooting in low light.  I pretty much use this outdoors as the 100mm with the 1.6x crop factor of my Rebel XT eliminates most indoor oppurtunities.	1
B000EOUL74:hp_q6227a_signature_soft-style_camera_case_(pink):linda_l._sutton	I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.	0
B000FZ1FD6:classic_boots:deborah_dipert	These boots look good with everything from jeans to skirts.

Didn't have any problem with them fitting my calves. I had that problem with other boots I have tried before. Even if you don't consider the great price for all leather boots, they are wonderful buy	1
B000066T1G:no_title:	The magazine is very nice with color pictures and recipes that look okay, but that ingredients are either rare or expensive, the magazine is too fancy, and it's hard to find what the recipe is like. They don't put a review, you have to tell for yourself. And plus if it doesn't have a picture, you have to guess what's in it. I rate it one star. I'd rate it a half star if there was such thing, but there isn't. I wouldn't buy this magazine	0
B000HE3466:their_customer_service_stinks:kc_"cranky_pants"	I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes	0
B000002H5I:one_of_the_best_albums_of_the_eighties:jordan_c._brice	I got the LP version of this album as a Christmas present in 1988. I immediately fell in love with it. She sings about issues such as unemployment and poverty which were rampant during the Reagan years ("Talkin about a Revolution", "Fast Car"). But she offered hope that things would get better as we approached the 90s, which they did. "Mountains O Things" was about the materialsim of the 80s. Other issues she covers are racism ("Across the Lines") and domestic abuse ("Behind the Wall"). Even though this album is almost 20 years old it does not sound dated, as the messages are just as relavent today as they were in 1988.	1
B000971N78:not_for_me:michelle888	I really wanted to like this but I find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. When I went back to get a lighter color, it did the same.

B0002OOMSA:za_grill_works_well:r._whitehead	I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes.

586370	This was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand. Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than I did.	0

This camera is fantastic if you shoot right.  I suggest this camera over all the other similarly-priced models.  We have done extensive testing with many cameras and this is my favorite.  The JVC is many thousands more and you get less grain with it in dark areas, true, but for the money, the DVX, if you shoot properly with it, will get you amazing results.	1

It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror	1
492580	I got American Girl when I was nine. and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it. I think you can be intreseted in Teen People type magazines but still love American Girl. It has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the "lunch box" section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. It is a short magazine, but they make up for it by having the JUMBO summer issue. I think its definitaly worth the money.	1
B00017LF24:damned_fine_salt!:mr._picky_"t_h_b"	I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn.  It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars.  Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known.  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better.  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.	1

B00008ELLG:incompatible_with_panasonic_lumix_fz1:tahir_j._naim	The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.	0

B000A823O8:finally_a_pair_that_fit:m._stillwell_"molly_jane"	My husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing.  We love them.  I gave him two pair for Christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently...seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these.  They look great too	1

B000J0XELI:simple_and_workable_solution_to_tie_management:fkc_"fkc"	I bought two of these as a gift for my husband.  He'd previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed.  These were ready to go right out of the box, no assembly required, took up less space in his closet than the 3-4 hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had, and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from.  The cushioned tie "hooks" ensure the ties will not slip off, and also that they will not be damaged.  A breeze to organize his vast tie collection.  And he's loving this product	1

494405	The magazine is supposed to be for girls 8 and up... it is not. An 8 year old girl does not need to have information on contracting herpes, being sexually active and  kissing. I am dissapointed that society thinks 8 year olds are ready for this material and thinks getting this info from a magazine rather than a parent is appropriate	0

167931	A boy has a college interview at a small academy and meets the other guys there.  And they talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  They go to classes and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Then they go down to dinner and and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.  Then nighttime comes and the boys all feel themselves up.  In other words, this movie is vintage DeCoteau.  It defies all known logic (the boy shows up for his college interview, is accepted immediately and somehow moves in the same day with no luggage or discussion with parents), has lame effects and lots of half naked boys.  It's hard to tell if this is a commentary on the Catholic Church scandals or just another excuse to show writhing youg men in bed. Definitely another laugh riot from the director of such "classics" as Leeches and Leather Jacket Love Story	0
B0009HXWCM:doesn't_meet_up_to_the_little_tikes_name:trousseau4_"mom_of_4"	Normally I am a big fan of the little tikes name, but not so with this product.  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and although the concept is cute, it is not like other Little Tikes products.   To begin with, the train frequently comes off the track.  Also to activate it, you must press the button where the conductor goes.  However, it is difficult for my daughter to place the figure on this spot without it falling off.  She often presses the button in the process which activates the train while she is still trying to put the figure on it which frustrates her.  Since this is geared for toddlers, you would think that Little Tikes would have put the button to activate the motion in a different spot from where the figures go.  Also, at age 2 1/2 she is quickly bored with it.  She has more fun letting it go on the floor across the room than riding on the track.  Needless to say, it is going back.  The only good feature is that you can "pack it and go" for away from home fun	0
B000E8UCME:leaky_diapers:holly_ann_hodge	I like the concept of no chemicals in a diaper, so I bought Tushies.  When my baby was newborn, they seemed to work ok, maybe because she didn't put out that much.  She is now three months old.  I practice attachment parenting so I know exactly when she has a bowel movement.  The past two bowel movements the diaper has leaked horribly.  She was sitting on my lap, she had a bowel movement, five seconds later I got up to change her, the feces was all over my pants.  This has happened several times.  The concept of the diaper is great, but the diaper needs some work around the legs	0
439810	This is a fun game to play. I am on the 2nd mystery to solve. I do love these types of games. This one is sort of like Trace Memory, alot of reading to do in it. I am an adult woman. My 11yr. old son says it doesnt think he would want to play it though.	1
B000BF3RJA:no_need_to_get_a_fancier_diaper_pail_than_this:nina	This pail does not need special plastic bags--you can use leftover grocery bags, etc., which is a big advantage.

The price can't be better for everything you get.	1

174326	Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did	0
B0001DJSYU:i_love_it!:artistic_c_"christina_y."	This is a great camera. The quality is good and the camera is very durable. I've accidently dropped the camera several times, and it still works. However, I would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time.	1
B000HBVVG4:another_one_bites_the_dust._:numbercruncher	The product is great, calling tech support is a task though.

B0001QIUFA:best_grill_cleaning_brush_i've_ever_had:mike_testa	Excellent quality, functional, and flexible. Extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned.  The rubber grip was a nice touch, and the replaceable brush heads are unique.  This comes with 3 brush heads, and after those are used up you can get them for under $2.00 each. This is a very solid, well-built tool that is built to last. I highly recommend this.	1
B000046S2U:unhappy_customer:melani_garay	This diaper pail is certainly the worst I have used.  It works ok for about a week and by the end of that first week I was ready to get a new diaper pail.  It does not keep oders in much at all, and I don't even put poopy diapers in it.  After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good.  Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this.  I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail	0

B000E158CA:where_do_i_start?:joseph_vaccarella_jr._"joe_vac"	I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units	0

261661	I would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn't worthy of its title. I subscribed before reading review, I was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read, though some stories are interesting I'm sure I'd be able to find them in other magazines like Vogue or Cosmo. and there is plenty of ads, probably more than stories. And much like other reviewers When I first ordered it, it took forever for the first issue to arrive, now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	0

B000N6TX1S:the_opposite_of_utopia:skymac2	In my 1-3-2007 review of the Harry Potter DVD series, I said about Alfonso Cuarn's direction of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that "perhaps Cuarn held back from doing his own thing" because Chris Columbus had directed the previous Harry Potter releases and had oversight to Azkaban. Well the notion that Cuarn was holding back in his Potter directorial was confirmed in my mind after seeing Children of Men.	1

243772	WOW! Just received my Toro 51598 Ultra Electric Blower/Vac and all I can say is "thar she blows". This blower at high speed actually pushes me (at 150lbs) back! I borrowed a friends Husqvarna 225B Hand Held Gas Blower and the Toro Ultra litterally blows it away, not to mention no exhasut fumes or messing with gas mixture. Its quieter and lighter too. Variable speed is a very nice option when you dont want full "thar she blows". Only problem is of course its electric and you need to fool with a cord which can be somewhat annoying particularly when you got a 3 acre lot	1

B000E66RQQ:a_handy_portable_stain_remover!:kharianna	I can say before I started to use this product I was always afraid of wearing white clothings but Tide to Go has totally changed everything.  Initially I thought this was just a gimmick but I thought it was worth a try,...soo...I bought it with me during our two-week trip with my parents in August..and it came handy...My dad bought a brand new white jacket and had it put on immediately and then decided to drink a cup of coffee..unfortunately, he spilled the coffee on the white jacket when he tried to open the lid to put sugar in it...my mother immediately wiped the coffee off with napkins..the coffee stain, however, was still there...Then..I remember I had put a Tide-to-Go in my purse...I immediately used it on all coffee stains on the white jacket...and to my surpise, all the brown spots resulted from the coffee spill were GONE...amazing..I have used this on different kind of food stains.  I've used it on Coffee stain, spaghetti sauce stain, juice stain and they all worked.  My mother, my mother-in-law, and my sister-in law they were all so amazed at the result that they all asked me for one to carry with them.  Nowadays I don't leave home without one in my purse..I used to be afraid of wearing white clothings, I am no longer afraid of wearing whites because of Tide-to-Go..this is definitely a useful product to carry with you everywhere you go..oh..as far as the smell goes..The smell is bearable to me...and in order to use it you have to push it down to get the actual fluid to flow out through the tip of the Tide-to-Go marker.	1

B000H89E20:razer_needs_better_manufacturing_!!!!:m._dease_"endgamesb"	Let me start off by saying like some others out there, Theses seemed like a dream come true.  Got my First PAIR( yes i said first) and used them with my existing motherboard soundcard.  They sounded about the same as my old ones but that was to be expected.  I was saving in the meantime for the AC-1 soundcard that goes w/ the head phones.  One day i come home and go to play a game and no sound is coming out of the left ear and one of the lights on the vol control is dead.  DOuble check with oter PC's and verify bad headset. OK no problem amazon was great with the exchange. got my 2nd pair in a week. I decided to wait til i got the soundcard to hook the headphones back up.  got the card for my B-day and went to town and set every thing up only to find that the left rear channel was not working but if i pushed on th cord a little you could here a small sound. Plus one of my 3 dvd roms now did not work on account of a IRQ conflict i believe. O' Well just bad luck i guess.  Sent it back, again amazon very good about it.  Soundcard sound ok with my old headphone but does not have EAX or X-fi which alot of games use.  Today i got an email saying that Amazon realizes there is a problem with the headpones and will not send me a replacement but will refund me my money and will take back the sundcard as well. so there you have it. Razer seems to have issues with it's production, thats what you get for outsorcing manufacturing. Amazon was great and I'm Happy they didn't just ship me another POS	0

B00063KPU6:good_holster,_buy_it_from_amazon:arleli_oviso_"xxjinxx"	This is a good holster for my V220. It doesnt hang up on me as much as the erson who last reviewed it did. For a holster i give it 4 stars because its function is to hold the cell phone in place on your belt. One problem i have with it is that it holds the phone down by where the strap should be, so having a strap on it wouldnt work too well. and also because it holds it where the strap is, it adds a little wear to that area. Other than that its a good holster for the price. And thats another one of my problems. I paid 14 dollars for this at my local mall, which was highly over priced for my standards. Amazon seems like a great place to buy it, but if you search for Motorola V220 Phone Accessories, then you can find a site with free shipping for it, and its 7 bucks. Theres also another site that has it for 3 bucks, but with shipping. I trust amazons shipping though. So if you want a functional holster, get this one	1

B0006IQK5U:promises_everything,_delivers_nothing.:wrath_of_chaka_khan	I bought TendSkin to help with the irritation and razor bumps I get on my neck from shaving. The product claims to, "reduce appearance of unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, and redness from shaving." But despite it's lofty promises and high price, it does none of this. In fact in my case it made the irritation and red bumps worse, I have sensitive skin and the main ingredient of this product is alcohol. The directions tell you to apply it after shaving, but because alcohol dries out your skin and is painful to apply after shaving, it only made my problem worse. I wish I could have rated this product zero stars, because it is absolutely worthless	0
176819	Half-Life 2 for pc put on the x-box sounds like it should work.  The core gameplay is still the same and is good fun once you get a few hours into it. The graphics are decent but won't blow you away like the pc versian. So what's the problem it's Half-life 2 on the x-box just a little watered down. Well there is one single problem that really irritates me to the point i would give it three stars. L.O.A.D.I.N.G!!!! This game loads more than you actually play it. It simply ruins the action! Your in the middle of a tense adrenaline pumped chase and your really into it when it all suddenly stops and the game loads. The loading times last between seven to thirty seconds and it really just makes you want to swear at the t.v. screen. Half-life 2 for x-box isn't bad game but it is completley inferior to the p.c. problem which had loading problems as well. It's possibly worth a rental if can sit through all the constant loading but beyond the loading issue it's worth a playthrough. There is no multiplayer and the single player is all your getting so don't buy.	1
B0002MABGE:not_that_great:tf	Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place	0
B0002EXF2O:color_me_a_little_disappointed:gail_e._guthridge	The quality of the china is very good. The weight and feel of the product is substantial. I was disappointed in the color and antique look to them. From the pictures I thought the color was going to be more of a buttercream yellow rather than ivory white and the antiquing more attractive.

But I was given one of these and now I think it's worth it.  It is a really strong file, so strong that my mother was startled by how much it took off the first time she used it.  You really only need very gentle pressure and speed with this type of file.  It is very easy too clean and shows no signs of wear, by this time I usually would have killed a normal file	1

B000067J48:don't_be_fooled:"mr_dont_play"	I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed	0

B000LI3AQM:must_have_for_sports_team_:judy__b	This bench is a must have for outdoor sports. This is the second instabench we have bought as the other one wore out.  It is sturdy and can comfortably fit a coach along with many players on this bench.  The bench itself is a little heavy and bulky but portable enough to throw into the car and go.  The frame is made well.  There were only two issues that I had with the bench.  The first is that the plastic material on the bottom of the seat separated from the top seating material.  Second is the carrying case ripped after a few months of carrying it back and forth to the fields. The top sides ripped along with where the shoulder strap meets the material on the bag.     therefore the rate of 4 stars	1
B00074T83Y:the_harbinger_you_want,_the_glove_you_need.:peopleinmotion	This is the Harbinger you need unless you are going to be power lifting only then I suggest you look into the 12xx series but they are for very quick lifts and not for wearing more than ten minutes because they are like wearing boxing gloves. If you want to spend time in the gym lifting say the big three like squats, deadlifts and bench presses for a couple of sets then the Harbinger 140 Pro WristWrap Glove is exactly 100% what you need. I would never, and I mean never, buy another glove again simply on the bases that every other type of glove I have used has split within two months of use while Harbinger just lasts through deadlift upon deadlift upon deadlift and looks as good as the day I bought them. The wrist strap is a really nice touch, very long and wraps around and around to keep those wrists nice and firm for the big lifts. You go to the gym and you want a pair of gloves that will support you and last longer... look no further. Buy them	1
87311	It appears that the Viatek product (Bark Stop Pro) is related to the Lentek design (PC16 ; ASIN: B0002Q89O6) - they are based on a common design by a Lentek engineer. I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the "Audible" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the "Ultrasonic" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.	0

B0000DBN1G:creative_caffeine-free_rooibos_blend:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	After growing up in Africa, one becomes rather fond of Rooibos tea and I never thought the day would arrive when I would recommend anything but a pure Rooibos tea. Tazo has taken Rooibos tea to a new level by blending African Rooibos (red bush) with hibiscus, lemon myrtle, lemon verbena, orange peel, rosemary, and lemon balm.	1
B000FH2ZI8:this_is_much_better_than_the_stuff_in_my_grocery_store:mmb	This is great instant oatmeal, I eat it almost every morning. I used to buy the Quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but I will continue to buy this. It is very convenient to order this in quantity even though I'm the only one in my household eating it, since I go through it pretty quickly	1
B0000633KZ:not_for_the_v66:	Although it's listed under the accessories section for the V66, it is NOT for the V66.  Well, I guess it will work with just the phone, but not the extra battery.  No sense in having this if it doesn't charge the second battery.  I checked it out on the Motorola site, and in fact, it is the wrong one.  This charger is the Motorola SPN5029, which doesn't work with the V66 and 2nd battery.  The correct number is the SPN4970	0
221142	i think j-14 is a really good magazine if u like to hear the latest gossip about all your favourite celebrity's, or if u like to get nice posters of all the hot celebrity's, or even if u like to take those quizes to find out lots of neat different things!! i recomend this magazine to anyone who likes either of those things	1
B0002PD2IK:nice_fit:navy_paul	This is a great fit for a silk shirt. I thought it would not be a close fit being silk, but I was wrong. This item fits snug and looks great on. Both alone and layered.  I would recommend this shirt to people that like the look of a tight tank.	1
B000JD3AL4:beware_mac_users--secret_e-file_bug_lurking_at_end:great_scott	I bought the Mac version of TurboTax Premier, and I installed it on my Mac with OS 10.3.9. After doing my entire return, I clicked to e-file and received a message saying, "Could not load attribute," This error box gave me the options to continue (which just took me back to the e-file page, which led me to the same error message) or connect to Intuit online support.

58015	I felt like I was taking a piss on myself the whole time I listened to this album. What happened to the 40 water of the old days that used to rap with spice 1, 2pac, and mc breed? This clone of 40 raps with the likes of Lil jon (wack as hell), washed up 80 year old too short, and a bunch of losers I have never heard of. The album only gets props because eightball and mjg are on the album and ugk. And they almost played themselves by appearing on this god awful so called "album". E-40 has fallen into this commercial west coast version of crunk called "hyphy" in attempts to breathe life into his lifeless career. The album has some decent beats on it but there is no kind of lyrical content to be found anywhere. E-40 wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Krs-One cd. This cd is wack simple and plain, Pee-40 is a beat waster, and he needs to find the nearest car wash and start drying off cars!!	0
B0007NT4MA:excellent_pack,_especially_for_students:jgama25_"proud_father"	Highly recommended!!!! My wife uses this pack for nursing school.  As you can imagine she carries A LOT OF "STUFF".  This pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps.  I would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school	1
B000B6RN4E:don't_bother_unless_you're_looking_for_a_plinker:c._thomas	Okay, here's the bottom line.  If you're just getting into airsoft, this could be an okay gun for backyard can shooting or whatnot.  But if you're actually looking to get into the sport competitively, look for a Classic Army or Tokyo Marui AUG.  It will be more expensive, but it will be quality.  The number one rule of the airsoft world is: You get what you pay for.  This is a cheap gun, and it's going to perform like a cheap gun.  If you're looking for a decent cheap gun, let me recommend the UTG Warhawk, UTG MP5 or some of the CYMA MP5 line	0
289383	Much has been said about the technical aspects or systems requirements of the game, as have many reviews for Oblivion and other next-gen or advanced games on the market today.

B000KURO9K:really_disappointed_with_viamichelin_x-930_gps:mark_l._bradford_"drmbradford"	I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.	0
B000CMOLEC:froggy_tales_night_lite:mary_j._rowe	Another great purchase received on time and in excellent condition. Can't say enough good things about the vendor and the shipping process; it was painless and full of customer service; a rarity these days	1

B0006TT0E2:a_big_disapoinment:hallie_engel	Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one	0

B000060MLD:i_must_be_out_of_the_loop:barbara_lewis	Based on negative reviews, either I've been knitting too long to still have good sense, or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine. It is my favorite, and I do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters. I found about 6 cardigans in just the last 2-3 issues (a reviewer didn't find any in a couple years of issues). Re Zimmerman-type designs, you can make any sweater in one or two pieces, change gauge, needle sizes, yarns, etc. Search Websites to give you the basics for free. After 2 years of crochet, I learned to knit at age 8 with 2 pencils for needles, found that quad-ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain, fancy, Aran, Jacquard, sideways or you-name-it. I like Knit 'N Style. Thanks for reading this	1

The lock fell off later that same day.  Now the dumb thing won't even stay on for 15 minutes and when I do get it attached my 13 mo. old can pull it right off	0

B000MCH54K:beautiful._as_always._:jetblacknewyear	If you enjoyed Explosions In The Sky's last album "The Earth Is Not A Cold Dead Place", and the songs by the group on the "friday night lights soundtrack", then surely, you shall find love for their newest record "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone". If you are new to Explosions In The Sky, I can only personally describe their music to you as lush, captivating, graceful, energetic, and highly inspirational art rock instrumentations. Please ignore reviewers who rate this album negatively because they don't like it as much as their last album(yet). "All of a Sudden I Miss Everyone" is different than previous records; It is alot darker, but at the same time hopeful and promising, best listened to on a rainy day or a cold dark night(again, personal description). What more can I say... this is about as beautiful as three guitars and a drum set can sound. My favorite album of 2007 so far.	1
B0001PG1PW:not_a_good_station_or_a_good_value:ellen_williams	For the price I paid I expected much more accuracy.  The data it downloads from its external monitor to the PC is terrible.   Even though the unit is synchronized with the atomic clock it still seems to get the dates wrong on the data it stores in its database.  It also has a problem with the accumulated rainfall.  The amount of rainfall according to the database is much higher that what the display shows for the accumulated amount.  The hourly and 24 hour period also tend to behave eratically. You might see an inch of rain in the last hour but when you come back later, the last 24 hours shows only .2 inches of rain.  Strange.  How can you have more rain in the last hour than in the last 24?  Seems backwards.	0
B0007XPS98:marketspice_is_as_good_as_the_reviews:phil_mickelson_"software_programmer"	I lived in Seattle for almost 20 years.  However, in all that time, and even going down to the Pike Place Market at least 2 or 3 times a year (we lived far east of town), I never "knowingly" drank MarketSpice Tea.  However, we moved to North Carolina and "discovered" this wonderful drink.  We also became avid tea drinkers.  A good part of that conversion, was due to MarketSpice Tea.	1
B0007CQ6XG:cradler_doesn't_work_for_older_kids:karen_odell-barber	My son is 8 months old.  He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing.  I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat.  It does not help in this regard at all.  In fact, it just annoys him.  I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.	0

B000JNSON8:does_not_charge_all_at_"once":l._stein_"angry_consumer"	Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.	0

I bought this CD out of none-too-scientifical curiousity, that, and &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind&quot; - and guess what?  I'm beginnin' to dig the entire CD.  As I mentioned, 99 &amp; 44/100th% of &quot;rap music&quot; fully explains to me what Gregg Allman meant when he sang, &quot;It's not my cross to bear.&quot; OK, that being said, Eve pulls no punches (although the &quot;skits&quot; on the thing about wet myself laughing), and she's not a lady whom'd I'd like to cross.  But &quot;I bought the ticket, so I'm gonna take th' ride.&quot;  And enjoy myself mightily while doing so..	1
B000AR7S30:good_watch:r._crabb	I am pleased with the watch.  It syncs with the big clock in Colorado every morning at midnight.  We also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst.  For $40 you can't go wrong.  Only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so I chose 1.  It rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight.  Guess I need to lose a couple more pounds so I can take another link out!	1

B000EPNE3Q:rip_off:cathy_mcmullen	This item does not work.  It does absolutely nothing.  I bought one and then was sent a second one. Neither one works.  It was a gift and I felt so bad that I gave someone a gift that didn't work	0
373333	Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely	0
B0000Z7MU6:great_but..........ouch!!:firejeep	I love the look and function of this watch BUT.....Guys if you have any hair on your wrists, be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band.

My wife thinks this jerky is okay apart from the processed texture and our dogs love it, but I won't be trying it.  To be fair, you might like this product if you aren't sensitive to MSG, but the seller should have noted that it contains a modern ingredient that causes adverse reactions in some people instead of describing it as being "made the old fashioned way."  On the plus side, shipping was very quick.	0

B000000CSH:paper_roses_-_not_the_original:	I was very disappointed that the version of &quot;Paper Roses&quot; included on this CD is an updated and new recorded version from 1990.  It is not the original 1973 classic Marie recorded when she was twelve.Interestingly, this new version is produced by Sonny James, the original producer of the original single, that also features many of the original studio musicians.  So all is not lost. Still, I prefer the original hit version and am disappointed there was no indication that this CD included an updated &quot;Paper Roses.&quot	0
340770	We were very disappointed in this toy.  It does not spin fast enough to make the paint spray evenly over the cardboard.  My older children had a spin art toy that was great.  It made the most spectacular designs. This is not worth the effort or money	0
B0000AY9XY:not_worth_the_hype:kamysmom2006_"kamysmom"	I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles.  Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!!  The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them.  She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot.  Don't waste time or money with Avent!	0
127736	Over 20 years after it was published, the story of the Israeli attempt to eradicate massive and repeated terrorist attacks emanating from the PLO (Bubba's/Jacques/UN's buddy Yasser) in Lebanon is no less important.  Interestingly, Lebanon is still struggling to rid itself of Syrian occupation.  They have gone from the vegan dictator Hafez Assad murdering opponents and journalists to the Syrian optometrist dictator murdering opponents and journalists (another killed last week 7/2005).	1

6305812055:a_decent_film_in_storytelling:_worth_a_look!:ernest_jagger	"To Live," does not hold the same appeal for me as it once did in the past. However, I do recommend viewers to at least take a look at this film. The films narrative deals with the lives of Fugui and Jiazhen, a husband and wife with two children, as well as Fugui's mother. The time period is from the 1940s up to the 1980s. Because Fugui has a gambling problem the family loses everything: house and possessions, which splits the family apart. It is a time when the Chinese Nationalist's and Communist's are battling for control of China. Further, the film deals with the social upheaval that is afffecting the lives of many Chinese. Although the film never criticizes the changes incurred by Mao Tse Tung, just the view of the how people's lives were affected accomplishes this task very well.	1

B000JCY26M:well_worth_the_money:charlene_d._loyd	We love this camcorder!  We bought it because our other bulky, digital video that uses tapes, which we would have to copy onto VHS/DVD, stopped working.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money.  We loved the idea that it was easier to carry in my purse and you could download it straight to the computer or burn it (which is very simple to do, and you do not have to download any software.)  I have to admit I was a little reluctant that the quality of the picture would be less than great, and only 60 minutes concerned me, but the pictures is great and I haven't ran out of time yet.  We have used this indoors, outdoors and have no problems.  We have recorded our son's basketball games and it worked great.  We read where the batteries didn't last very long, but we have been using rechargeable batteries and have been impressed with lifetime they have.  This is a must for those who have children or grandchildren	1
B0006VBIFY:great_design,_poor_quality:norm_s	This carafe was initially perfect.  The design is attractive and simple, and it fits well in my bag in the mornings.  The problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute.	0

B000FQ03PG:very_nice_camera,_simple.:kate_bean_"kate"	After buying this camera I was pleased for the most part, as the interface is extremely simple and the picture quality is very good. It's a sleek, smooth design with minimal buttons, thus little confusion. There are 3 things, however, that I'm not happy with. One is that it takes double A batteries, and eats them up REALLY fast. The second thing is that there's no secondary viewfinder, just the LCD screen. The LCD screen is large, which is great.. but this is why the battery life is so low. You can't turn the LCD screen off, so batteries go fast. The third and final thing I dislike about it is that there's no AC adaptor, so whenever you plug your camera into the computer or the TV, not using it to take pictures, you have to run it on batteries. That is, unless you somehow find a compatible 3 volt AC plug, which is neither on the Vivitar website, or anywhere else online that I can find made specifically for this camera. I'm a little upset that it came with no adapter, as that would be SO useful for a camera that eats up batteries. I reccomend rechargibles if you're going to get this camera	1

B00008GSX5:not_durable:l	Bought this set at Target 3 years ago for $200, and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them.  They're heavy, cooked things well, and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool.  Never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil (metal, etc) in them that didn't belong in them.  Took care when washing, didn't burn things in them, etc.  Somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months, and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement. Because I didn't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set, and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating, they had to go straight to the trash.  Very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life, with high care and high cost.  The 2nd star is because they are beautiful and I cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these, they might work for you.  For me, stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go.  I wouldn't even try another "non-stick finish"	0
B000EXVTJE:be_cautious:l._casey	This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal	1
B000067J15:another_great_spy_movie_entry_but_bare_dvd:stephen_kaczmarek_"educator,_writer,_consultant"	Less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor, "In Like Flint" still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the Bond films.  The indomitable Derek Flint returns to save the world, this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world's women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes (leading to, perhaps, the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film--upon discovering that the man in the White House is not who he seems to be, a disbelieving Flint says, "An actor as president?").  That is, until a renegade ZOWIE general (Steve Inhat) decides it's his turn to take the reins of power.  The delightful Lee J. Cobb is back as Flint's curmudgeonly boss, Cramden, as are the secret agent's posse of female admirers, and TV's Batgirl, Yvonne Craig, even shows up as a Russian ballerina.  "In Like Flint" feels more grown up than the previous film, partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody.  Notions like the Red Scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind--and charging a premium for them--are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows, cross-dressing, and the bouncing sing-a-long ball.  Only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either Flint film worth comment, as it's a staple of the genre, meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort:  a no-frills DVD.	1
B00004ZAW4:poor_design-avoid!:pony-express	Well, I ordered this online as we couldn't find any window-mounted feeders locally. It's lasted exactly two weeks. The problem is the extremely weak design: the 14oz glass feeder is fairly heavy-too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups, as this has. There are somewhat strange instructions with this model, directing the user to &quot;rub&quot; the suction cups for several minutes in order to (supposedly) build up a proper &quot;suction&quot;-then the glass slides into a groove; well, the thing worked at first-until I had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it. I did it as gingerly as I could, not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups, refilled it(only halfway!)-and replaced it. About 4 minutes went by-and then the entire thing-glass, suction cups, everything-fell to our deck, breaking into a million thick glass shards...frustrating me, the hummers-and our two dogs, banished from the outside until I could clean up this mess. What a crummy product! And overpriced-although I wouldn't buy it again for two cents. Beware	0
B000H6G44I:not_the_greatest:chris&kellyr	I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use	0
B000MH0JO8:beautiful_cards!:a._wilkins	I love this set of cards.  So many beautiful, unique cards that will really make an impact.  The organizer is such a great concept and can be used forever... just go out and buy new cards to replace those that you've used in a category.  As another reviewer reports, there is a lack of "male" cards and most cards are on the feminine side... but that probably is more telling of the population that gives cards!  I bought my set at Costco where the price was much lower, fifteen dollars!  A great deal if you are able to snag them there	1
B000BN9F84:best_sound_for_the_money_-_best_comfort:c_powell	I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine	1

B0000E5U5O:so_much_fun!:mom_of_2_boys	I bought this as a Halloween gift for my then 3 year old son in 2004.  He loved its spooky sounds and the neat turns and tricks in the house.  He doesn't really use it much anymore, but now my 18 month old loves it!  He can actually follow the whole progression, turning and pulling levers and platforms at the right time.  This toy has been great for our family.  It is pretty durable, some pieces are not quite as smooth as they once were and the pop out skeleton at the bottom is not working anymore, but considering what it has gone through, it has performed amazingly well	1
B0006DS3KU:it_saved_my_hair...:pamela_ferrer_"eyesonly1031"	I don't know about the people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews but this product is the ONLY thing that saved my hair. I did everything from getting a curly perm to stripping the color. I used coconut oil, frequent trims, keratin treatments and NOTHING worked. My hair still kept breaking and splitting like clockwork. When I used the product, 3 treatments later and it's never been healthier. The product is very oily, so USE SPARINGLY when you use it as a gloss or leave in conditioner!	1
B0007L79BK:so-so:l._oliver_"weary_one"	I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name.  They were not what I was expecting when they arrived.  They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be.  They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent.  The silver is also okay, but could be better.  I would not recommend.	0

B000F9HMJI:surprisingly_smooth_taste_in_a_little_packet:ed_uyeshima	I have to admit I had little hope for the little sample of ground coffee that I received from Amazon as part of a free promotional package to promote their new non-perishable grocery line. However, against all odds, I find Millstone's product to be among the smoothest tasting coffees I've had from a package. Understand that I am mainly part of the mobile Starbucks-and-Peets crowd that's used to the aftertaste of the wooden stirrer and the slightly curdled milk when I swallow my caffeine. Normally I prefer grinding my own beans at home, but given my predilection for my infrequently used French Press maker, I occasionally enjoy a heaping brew of the roasted Colombian Supremo. Each of the sixteen packets is 1.75 ounces, enough easily for about six cups. I say give it a try as a relatively convenient alternative to your normal coffee run	1
B000089Y9O:the_best_r&p_gospel_i've_ever_heard!!:nicole_caldwell_"famu_gc_girl"	I have been following gospel since the early 80s.  I am a big fan of contemporary gospel and Shei Atkins defines how R&P gospel should sound.  Trinitee 5:7 along with Dawkins & Dawkins have done a great job so far, but Shei Atkins covers it all--Relationships (cheating, divorce, pre-marital sex); worship; hymns; enocuragement; you name it and she has a song for it.  I just bought the CD and I can't take it out of my CD player!!	1
B000BOLA7W:greak_pressure_cooking_set:gian_luca_diana	I left my old pressure cooker (a Tefal made of steel) in storage in another state and I was dying to have a new one. I bought this because the price was great and the description seemed to make this set attractive and I'm very glad I did. Both pots (the large and the smaller) fit the pressure lid so it's like having two pressure cookers instead of one. One night I cooked lamb in the small pot and in 20 minutes I had a very nice and super tender meal and the next day I made beef broth with the large cooker so that I could freeze it and pull it out anytime I want it. I'm very satisfied with this product, it looks great, it's very efficient and it's very strong and durable. The set also comes with a cooking book containing easy recipes of all kinds, from main courses to desserts and even a table with cooking time for many items	1
B00004CJ2V:a_new_beginning_of_an_end:daroake_"darragh"	I thought I'd be nice in giving film two stars even though it pretty much deserves none at all. I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time. Jason is dead, isn't he?	0

I tried to get it replaced under warranty for two more years, until they skipped to Mexico. Tiles just didn't fall off, they spalted. The fire box broke, etc. When it got too bad to use and look at, we had to throw it away . . . a $1500 mistake.	0

I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse	0

B0000CERZK:a_little_lacking:viktor_57_"viktor_57"	I love sunflower seeds, chocolate, and cherries, so you can imagine my delight when I found these Chocolate Cherry Sunflower Seeds available on Amazon.  When the packet arrived, I tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth, expecting an explosion of chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity.  Instead, I got a mouthful of hard shells.  I crunched through the tough, outer hulls, wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard, unopened shells, but then as I macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash, found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing.	1

I love the rubber band that keeps all my bits of paper together.  The letters on the papers are very light which gives one the sense of having blank pages on which to write on.  Its perfect size to take around and very "low-key".  It is very personal and yet practical.	1

It's simple to play for anyone over age 3 (unless the child is orally fixated- there are smaller pieces, so use YOUR better judgment!), is fast enough to hold a child's (and adult's!) interest, and let's everyone relax and not worry about rules- we really enjoy it and are wearing it out pretty quickly. It has been a great gift for other friends as well as it's not too well-known.	1
206501	Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.

0867195126:breathtaking!:ryan_mcculloch	An amazing resource to the odd world of Chick collecting.  Mr. Fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost overwhelming guide to all of Chick's works and articles about him.  Everything is cross-referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information.  Minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter.  The book (presented in a distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers.  But even casual Chick fans will enjoy the &quot;History of the World&quot; segment, which ties all of Jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every instance of the term &quot;haw&quot; for instance).  Each tract and comic is described, and info is given on various parodies and rip-offs.  This is a must for all Chick fans (both &quot;saved&quot; and otherwise)	1

It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.  I'm in the process of trying to get a refund or replacement now.	0

B0003MIBYC:looks_nice,_but_"spring-loaded_arm"_is_useless...:brynn_fraser	While this is an attractive looking paper-towel holder, it isn't very functional.  At first glance, it looks like it should work as implied: 'spring-loaded arm puts pressure on paper towel roll, regardless of how many towels are on that roll at the time, allowing you to easily rip off a single sheet with one hand'.  Unfortunately, this model doesn't work that way...at least, not the one I received.	0

They have beautiful voices and I love the three part harmonies they come up with.  I was very excited to get their newest album but I was sure dissapointed.  This is a very dark and depressing album.  Almost every song is about lost love.  Also, all the songs but 1 are slow.  Where is the upbeat Shedaisy I fell in love with???  I would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to The Whole Shebang again.  Still, I look forward to what the future may bring from them.  These sisters have alot of talent	0

63810	My husband and I are both history and literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please, but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst. Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction	0
B000EGIDPY:less_is_not_more.:cheryl_a._"cherylannh"	I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send.	0

Rather than returning it, my husband wanted to eat the $59.99 plus shipping by beating it up with a baseball hat.  We went out and purchased the Kolcraft Universal carrier-- it is much simpler, easier to fold, and has a large, functional basket underneath the car seat.	0
B00005Y7M4:like_the_19th_century_coming_out_of_your_tv_set:kevin_killian	James Wong Howe's cinematography looks beautiful on the restored DVD version of this underrated film, an unearthly intervention which brings us the actual physicality of the 19th century in light and radiance.  It was an era in which electric light was just being invented and candles and gaslight were still the norm, that is, among people with the money to afford them.  The unwashed faces of the coal miners and the families they supported form a canvas from Brueghel, but even the whole weight of the mining companies cannot extinguish the inner spark in their eyes.	1

249895	i bought this item because my husband heard is the best internet security.  Now i regret buying one.  Since ive installed it, IT SLOWED MY COMPUTER, ITS VERY VERY HARD TO CLOSE WINDOW AND WORSE WHEN I DISCONNECTED FROM THE INTERNET I HAVE A HARD TIME LOGGING OFF.  everytime im on the internet,i get mad and upset. its not worth all the stress. i definitely dont recommend this product. now im trying to figure how i can return the product and go back to NOrton	0
B000ASDGZI:a_great_weight_bench_for_the_price..!!!!!!:christopher_a._ardolino	I purchased this bench about a year ago. I received it in 4 business days which I thought was really good. It took me about 45 minutes to put it together, there is alot of nuts and bolts, but once I finished assembly it has been a good machine, and I am still using it to do my weight lifting routines twice a week, it offers alot of different exercises, what I really love about it is the lat tower which alot of benches do not have until you get into the $300-$400.00 dollar range, which I was not willing to spend that much at the time. For the price of 129 bucks and the options you get, just can beat it. I am very happy with this machine. This machine is made by impex fitness and I definitely plan on upgrading to another impex when Im ready. Chris- V	1
B000COYKN2:quality_matches_price:shizzys	This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund	0
B000BIU1X2:excellent_quality:designer_girl	As an Interior Designer I was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs.  I liked everything about them, even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests.  I have other Sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal - these cushions let you sit and eat for hours	1

56705	I have looked at many photography magazines - many of them are just filled with ads....not what an amateur is looking for. I wanted indepth articles, helpful tips and information to help me improve my craft. I found it here. I read every issue cover to cover and back again. I find helpful information in every issue. I highly recommend this magazine - even if you aren't purely an &quot;outdoor&quot; photographer	1
B000DN7JMQ:wp_x3_falls_short_of_its_claims:anthony_g._o'malley_jr._"agojr"	I purchased the standard edition of X3 primarily for 3 reasons: 1) It claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into WP format, 2) It claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of WP Mail well beyond the capabilities of Outlook Express, and 3) It claims enhanced use of WP for word processing.	0
B0007MVMX0:nice_features_but_extremely_fragile:lloyd_borders	Bought this camera for my wife.  Takes good pictures but handle this camera with extreme caution.  If you drop it be prepared for a large repair bill.  Fuji customer relations is sub-par.  Warranty does not cover any impact internal damage.  I've had better luck with Nikon and Kodak and will steer clear of Fuji in the future	0
B000059EI7:_gets_lots_of_use:tiffany_mannes_"tlm_childcare"	I purchased this house for my in home day care. So we have lots of toddlers playing with it! They love it! The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it! He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and well worth the money	1
96065	It's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead & co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically "it's good, everything's going just way OK..." It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars	1
B000265CD2:get_rid_of_the_racoon_eyes!_:lara_dipaola_"so_the_mommie"	I've suffered most of my life from the "dark circle" syndrome. It's become much worse at nearly 35 years old with FOUR kids! A dear friend in the industry (my personal guru!) recommended this. It is NOTHING short of AMAZING! I wear it with just a tinted face lotion (foundation makes our wrinkles stand out as I now know) and once in a while a quick dust of bare minerals clear mineral veil. My husband commented (in only two days, which is a RECORD for him) that I must have slept well because my face looked so good. This stuff is SOOOO worth the price. I'll NEVER be without it again!	1
504693	I've had this camera for about 1 1/2 years now and it's been a tried and true companion.  I've easily taken over 10,000 shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs.  The features that really set this camera apart are the 12X zoom, the image stabilization (a must with such a large zoom), and the rotating screen (great if you want to take a picture of yourself :)).  I also love the macro mode, I've gotten some great quality close-ups.  For most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results, but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well.  Performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife, sports, landscape, beach, etc.	1
B000EMDOD4:perfect_for_tunnels:nava_paolo_"sales_area_manager"	it's a super idea, but i cannot say it works well. getting a free station is a real challenge, even in the underdeveloped Italy. and if you get one, but you are driving, within 5 minutes (or 5 miles) you lose the signal... however the sound is perfect when you enter into a tunnel.	0
B000184C2S:bad_luck_with_this_battery:honest_tim	I bought this battery in July 2004. I charged it as soon as I got it. I put it in the camera and then used the camera about 10 days later. The battery was dead. So I charged it again and put it in the camera again. I used it and it seemed to work fine. But the next time I went to use the camera (Approximately 2 weeks to a month later.) it was dead again. As I write this review I am sitting in a hotel room in Prague. I charged the battery ten days ago. I used it once 7 days ago and took approximately 15 to 20 pictures(Did not use the flash). I then used it again today. I was able to get another 15 to 20 pictures before it went dead( Did not use the flash). I bought the lithium rechargeable battery because they have the longest life and no memory. So now I have to charge the battery everytime I use the camera. This was a big disappointment. I get better life out of the standard Duracell alkalines. It appears that this technology hasn't been perfected or that Belkin has not perfected their quality control. Beware when buying this product	0

B0009EZG42:inoperatable_watch_for_kids:phyllis_acquah_"water"	I got the watches as party favors for my 10year old party guests, but none of the kids or I have been able to reset it. My daughter has been frustrated with it and says some of her friends she inquired from had the same issue with the watch. The 2 little knobs can't be manipulated as indicated on the accompanying  instruction sheet. Needless to say the watches are beautiful and attractive, but if kids for whom they were made can not reset them and use  them then the purpose is defeated. The service was great, but  the product is unsatisfactory.	0

B0009ISQD6:great_bag...warm...versitle...light...durable:c._fletcher	The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.	1
B00008ZPG9:love_it!!!!!:b._l._dinger	I've tried many a serum, potion, lotion, cream... every over the counter fit-it on the market and none have had the wonderful effect that this has had!  I know, Iknow... there are those out there who say the effect is fleeting, but I've yet to see it	1
B000216X7G:great_product:peggy_stevens_"love_that_bbq"	Cooks illustrated rated this product the best and so do I. I purchased two as gifts, one for my husband and one for my son-in-law for fathers day. Both are extreamly pleased with the product.	1

B0000936M4:we_love_these_bottles!:ksf	We started with Dr. Brown's when my daughter was just three weeks old - she's now 10 months - and have loved them from the very beginning.  We've used them both for breastmilk and for formula, and they've been great for both.  We've never had trouble with gas and have had very few spitting-up episodes, and I give all the credit to the bottles.  They're comfortable for me to hold, light enough that even a young-ish baby can hold them on their own, and easy to fill.  The cleaning is a bit of a pain - more parts than in other brands of bottles - but it's worth it.  And we haven't found that Dr. Brown's leaks any more than any other brand.  Definitely give these a try - they're great	1
181324	I guess the first thing i'll say is that I got Jedi Academy BEFORE I got this game. I was HUGELY dissaponted. I really liked Jedi Academy but this game is not that great. I have cheat codes so I can have all wepons and all amo and I can be undying. There are partes in this game that are INSAINLY tought. There are way to many puzzles - I don't mind puzzles but there are simply way to many. And some on them are insainly hard. I would recomend you to get Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy - way better the puzzles aren't insain and you get to choose what you look like and....well I could go on but i'll leave it there. If you aredy have Jedi Academy and you want another star wars game that is $20 then you sould get Battlefront thats anoter great game. Just don't get this game.	0

0226869024:distractingly_wrong:j.j._mccullough	The author of this book, Warren Wagar, is apparently a professor of "Future Studies." I certainly hope he has long been fired from that post. "A Short History of the Future" was  written in 1989, but the writer is so ignorant of politics, and so WRONG, to be blunt, it reads as if it was written in the 1940's. Orwell's 1984 is more on the mark than this.	0

The McAfee firewall seems sufficient so far	1
B000JE3Z3G:battery_powered_gloves;_little_heat_for_a_lot_of_money:ralph_furlong	I bought these gloves for my wife who has problems keeping her hands warm. The description of the gloves would have you believe that the battery powered gloves (using D cell Batteries) would provide heat to the hands for 6 to 8 hours.  In actuality, the battery will only provide heat for 35 to 40 minutes before it ends.  To make matters worse, the only heat provided is to the palm of the hand, no heat is provided to the fingers!	0
B000GRETCM:don't_buy_it,_seriously:l._holmes	I'm pretty good at getting devices up and running, but this thing is a complete mess. They don't have the software figured out, and the instructions for trying to fix it when it's not working are preposterously complicated. Note that it comes with no directions of any kind. In fact, it arrives with an unlabeled mini-disc with no indication of what it's for, what it is, how to use it, whether everyone needs it, or anything else. Nothing but the blank disc. Note that this device failing to work is a "Frequently Asked Question" on the Polar web site, and they have a list of about thirty things you're supposed to "check," most of which they don't explain as far as what it is you're checking FOR. (In other words, they say "Check the [whatever] setting," but they don't tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it.) Most of the instructions are outdated, don't apply to current version of Windows, or don't reflect current versions of their own software.	0

B00004WGML:don't_buy_this_toy!:terri_hughes	This toy is TERRIBLE!!  My daughter got this for Christmas, and it only frustrates her.  It takes too many cranks to get the clown to pop up, and she can't get the lid to stay shut without my help.  The "music" is terrible.  I would definitely not recommend this toy.	0
B000MEB3GE:it_remembers_so_you_don't_have_to:buzz_queen	I bought this when my daughter was 2 weeks old and it is simple to use and extremely helpful for sleep deprived mothers. With the touch of one button, I can keep track of how long it has been since I fed my baby. I don't use the sleep or diaper timers but this is worth it for the feeding timer alone. The first unit I was sent was defective and I received terrific customer service when I contacted the company. I am rating with 4 stars instead of 5 only because I'd like to be able to keep track of the daily total feedings as well. Maybe a future model	1
B00000DMBI:the_game_that_saved_christmas:l._griffin	When it first came out almost 20 years ago, I saw this game at a bookstore and bought it to take on a Christmas skiing vacation with my family.  Unfortunately, my mother ended up having emergency gallbladder surgery instead.  We didn't have gifts that year, but we did made it to Colorado and spent hours by the fire laughing until our ribs ached playing this crazy game.  It doesn't matter if you can draw, it's how fast you can put something down that halfway suggests the word they give you, and how ridiculous everyone's scribblings usually look.  I've played it with an artist. He couldn't even draw a nose and chin in the 20 seconds he had, so his artistic standards took a dramatic tumble. If my spirits need a boost, I play this game. Buy it.  You'll love it	1
B0000667BW:horrible_suction....:ashley_gunn_"pleasantone"	I am SO disappointed with this vacuum!  I will say, it does wonderfully for picking up all that dust and little bits of dirt that get into your carpet, but don't expect it to pick up anything that is big enough to be visible to the human eye!  Also, I have a cat - so I have pet fur on my carpet... AND I lose a lot of hair myself, and this vacuum doesn't pick any of that up... I can vacuum, run my hand over the carpet afterwards and come up with a handful of human and cat hair.	0

B0007VAOEE:china's_finest_garbage:ray_l._johnson	I threw this away yesterday (3.30.7) First of all, it's too cheaply designed and manufactured to stop anything as heavy as a door. The tin plate on it fell off last week and no one even broke into my home. I went to my local hardware store and purchased a solid steel 'Collins Axe #4 (wood) Splitting Wedge' to replace it. I bought a tube of Hard As Nail Heavy Duty contruction Adhesive and affixed some rubber to one side of the wedge to prevent slippage. Now that's the way a door wedge should be! Don't waste your money on this cheap Chinese garbage called the 'Super Door Stop Alarm'! Make your own right here in the USA	0
B000B8YCFK:yuck...:wylie	OK, so this is the 2nd Philosophy product that I've tried and felt the need to write a review on. I have to say, this product is far below expectations. I sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. There seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. Definitely not recommending this product.	0
B00005Q5IJ:not_pretty,_but_works_well:bippy_the_beardless	There isn't much you can say about a sharpening steel. It sharpens well, and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest. The handle is ugly gray plastic, but it seems solidly put together, and is easy to work with	1
23712	I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything.	0

269194	I bought the set in a rush without reading the reviews, big mistake! The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.  The beginner boot camp is boring though the advanced is challenging fun.  If I knew what wasn't included I wouldn't have bought it.  They should list what's not included in the description.  It seems somewhat deceptive	0

B00005O0L3:targus_does_not_issue_drivers_for_my_viewsonic_v37:mari-c	It worked OK for 2 months, but the KB kept on falling off. When I complained, I was told that the KB was not compatible with my Viewsonic v37. Yet, it was advertised as compatible with the VS PPC 2002. The worse came when I upgraded to PPC2003 and the KB stopped working. I contacted Targus and was told that they do not have plans for upgrading their KB drivers for this VS PPC.	0
B0002F1SOK:dont_waste_your_money:jonathan_ballard_"shalon_jackson"	I was talked into buying this product for minor fine lines. This product that I used for 4 months, showed no signifigant results as well as any other product Ive used by Estee Lauder. Dont waste your money on it. I usually look at it like this. If any cosmetic retailer offer a free gift with purchase it usually needs one to go with it. This product is crap!	0
B000M8RA08:the_size_is_all_wrong!:a._thompson_"purple_princess"	I loved the bathing suit the first time I laid eyes on it so I purchased it.  I'm actually small but I do have thick thighs so I got a medium.  But when it was delivered and I tried it on, it was too small!  I should have gotten a large.  The medium made me look like I had these big love handles.  So please whatever your size is make sure you get it a size bigger.  But other than that the bathing suit is great.  I'm just going to have to loose the love handles	0
B000F6X7RM:terrific_compact_camera:charles_mcbeth	The camera is great because it is small enough to slip into your pocket and take wherever.  I have been the main picture taker on our family vacations and get-togethers.  We had a 10X optical, 5 MP kodak camera that worked well, it was just big and bulky, never to fit in a pocket.  The 10X optical zoom on the V610 also works well, the lenses never protrude from the camera when I use the optical zoom.  The viewing screen is large and very clear.  The menus are very easy to navigate and the on camera editing tools are great.  It would also make a fine camera for a beginner.  The panorama function works very well also.  I have used it multiple times with ease and it created great pictures. The camera turns on quickly and the time between pressing the button and the photo capture is quick.  I have had the camera for about a month now and the best thing is the small size without having to compromise in zoom, picture quality, or functionality.  The LCD screen does take up some more battery than other cameras just because it is larger, but don't let that stop you from getting the camera.  You will be able to take at least 70 or so pictures on a battery and a lot more if you are conservative.  My only small frustration was when going skiing, I attempted to video my brother coming down the slope using the 10X optical zoom and the image stabilizer.  It was at night and only the lights were on, the camera wouldn't focus on him until he was close, but that may be just because of the low light conditions and glare from the snow. Otherwise the video has worked flawlessly.  There is even a terrific function that allows you to pause the video at any time during playback and create a picture from that video frame. (Very useful)  My brother bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ1K,(a very good camera also) before i got the V610 and now he wishes he got the V610	1
232527	Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.	1
493781	I have many men magazine, none comes close to Men's Health. Some magazines are too glossy that spell "expensive" for what ever they wanted to promote. With Men's Health, I get to everything from A to Z. I always pass my old copies to my local library for their own collection	1
B0002C7FHC:returned,_after_trying_it_on_myself_:(:jaqueline_belanoff-smith	well, i have a toy poodle, and he goes crazy when he hears someone at our door.  We live in a tiny studio in nyc, so if he hears someone going into their apt in the middle of the night, he goes crazy and wakes everyone up.  After a lack of sleep and total frustration i got this collar.  It work until one night i woke up to horrible noises when i saw that my dog had attempted to slip the collar off, and because of all his fur the collar was able to slide partially off but not all the way, leaving the electric part IN HIS MOUTH, and when he whined, it electrocuted HIS MOUTH....so i quick unhooked it and couldnt stop freaking out...so my boyfriend said that its not a bad shock, its just a quick pinched...so i tryed it on my neck, and my god, was it POWERFUL, it burned and paralyzed your whole area.  I made my boyfriend try it to just so he couldnt say i was being a p*ssy. We threw it right out after that.  I didnt even want to resell it or get my money back, because i would feel too guilty giving it to anyone else.  My suggestion is that you get JUST A SOUND CORRECTION device, with no electric correction, because i learned first hand its really not humane.  OR A SPRAY collar that shoots out a spray of citranella or something.	0
B000E6IL10:skype_better_come_up_with_something_quick_or_they_will_start_losing_market_share!:amerimak_"amerimak"	Do not buy this unit.  I have tested the VoSky, IOGEAR and now US Robotics and they are ALL junk.  While the speaker quality is acceptable the microphone sound quality is woefully inadequate.  I do not understand why no one is capable of developing a hafway decent unit.  And why are the SO SMALL!?  The are so small as to be practically useless.  The IOGEAR unit does not even incorporate mute and volume buttons.	0
B0009VCABM:nice_bike_for_beginners!:sam_gattis_"sam_gattis"	Quick shipping - I received this bike in 4 days (using free super saver shipping) and it was even over a holiday!  The bike comes in one large box with MANY pieces.  My husband and father put the bike together in less than 1 hour.  It looked a little overwhelming at first but was quite easy to assemble.  The bike is very compact and easily placed in small areas.  It is also very quiet - you have to listen closely to even hear the bike.	1
B000G1CYQQ:treo_clear_hard_case_with_belt_clip...not_so_hard!:chi-town-john	This worked for only a couple days. Although the belt/pocket clip held my Treo securely, it was a bit bulky and kept the phone far from my body and often in the way. After a cople of days, the star shaped piece on the back of the phone that clips into the beltclip started to disintegrate one star point at a time...after a couple more days it was useless.	0
B0000633KZ:nifty_dual_pocket_desktop_charger_for__motorola_v60:micki_sackler_"movie_maven"	This is a great little desktop charger pocket for the Motorala V60 and an additional battery.  However, it seems expensive for what you get, not to mention the fact that what the text doesn't tell you is that you need an *additional* (expensive?) serial cable/adapter in order to use it with your regular charger cable.  Unless you want to charge an additional battery at the same time, save money and just get the nifty travel charger with the folding plug for the bargain price...and just place the phone down on your desk or tabletop while it charges	1
B00008WMBS:can't_understand_the_problems_others_are_having:julie_a._thornberry_"julieforjesus"	This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke).  I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface.  It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device.  No problems whatsoever.  Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either.  I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work.	1
B000BPQUV2:accurate_and_easy_to_read:ny_psych_md	After having trouble with a different atomic clock, I decided to try again.  I chose the LaCrosse Atomic clock after reading other reviews from customers and searching online.  Overall, it's been great.  I was able to quickly set it up in my office; the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  My office is in a NYC commercial building, mostly made of mortar and brick with a steel frame.  Initially, I did not receive the signal in the day.  But the instructions pointed out that the signal is strongest at night, and the clock would most likely set at night.  Sure enough, the next morning, it was correctly set (even with the earlier daylight savings time).  I've found the black background with white numbers particularly easy to read from a distance.  My only concern was the same as that of other customers: Amazon packed it poorly, and the inner box holding the clock was totally free to bounce around in the outer box.  Fortunately, the outer box protected it enough, and the clock arrived unscathed.  Overall, I consider myself lucky, given the condition of many boxes delivered to my office building.  Otherwise, this is a nice, accurate, easy to read clock with a sense of style, as well	1

B0002FGFIY:really_disappointed:miriam_bookey_"avid_trendspotter"	I guess I'm spoiled by the I Spy games I've purchased for my children. This game has an enormous amount of "story"...it's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television. Interaction is confusing and frustrating. I'd rate this lower but it's clear that a lot of work went into the animation, which is top notch. I just wouldn't classify this as a learning game.	0

B00004C8ST:essential_for_first_time_moms:"rickalyssa"	This nursery care kit is great!  Before buying another care kit consider the following points, with the time and frustration you will save... you'll be glad you did.  The first week home from the hospital I used the nasal aspirator countless times.  It is very gentle but very effective.  The digital thermometer is quick and easy to use.  So much better than the glass and mercury kind.  The medicine spoon and dropper are very clearly marked so you know exactly how much you are giving your baby.  The nail clippers are curved so they can cut better with less chance of cutting your baby's finger.  Anyone that has ever cut their baby's  finger while trimming their nails will appreciate that!  The items in this kit are small and compact and very easy to store.  Great to keep in your diaper bag for when you're on the go	1

B00009YPNN:not_bad.:s_is_for_super_cool	I have been using this for awhile now.  Unlike some sports bras that are this supportive, it's a lighter weight material/construction.  I wouldn't say that there probably isn't something better out there and it isn't cheap - but it's not bad.  For my peers that have this 'issue', you know what I'm talking about!:	1
B000GD5DS0:great_tool,_not_as_intuitive_as_2000:m._peter	I upgraded to this version from Money 2000.  The interface looks cleaner, and the reports and budgeting options are better.  I do find it a little less intuitive than the older version that I am used to.  Overall, I'm happy with this product and there is room for me to get to know it better.  I think it will last me for several years	1

B0009XH6V4:very_good_compact_hair_dryer:beth_cholette_"doctor_beth"	I purchased this hair dryer for an unusual reason:  my old 1875 watt Conair was actually too much wattage for my bathroom (the circuit kept tripping), so I was actually looking for a dryer with LESS wattage.  However, I didn't want to sacrifice power, as I hoped not to have to devote any additional drying time to my shoulder-length hair.	1
B000B8P8T4:once_again_turbo_tax_delivers:t._verboon_"old_yellow_dog"	how can doing taxes get any easier?  this is my fifth year using turbo tax and I think each year gets easier and faster.  I love the way my information from the previous year is brought forward and the ability to e-file is just a click away.	1

B000FGLYWM:excelent_delivery_and_value:ganj_ahmad	I received my package within three days via the Super Saver Shipping (cost me nothing). The printer is great, too. I used the Brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to HP and I'm impressed. The printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up, and its very light weight and small size making it more portable. I love it	1
347005	Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it	1
B000NCHIG4:very_good_gun:d._garverick	i've had this gun a little over a mounth now and it still works great. don't bother useing the scope though it's a peace of junk the guns not acurit enough for it anyway. this gun is great for mid range rapid fire don't get this gun if u want a sharpshooter. the folding stock was broken when i got it but a little bit of vel crow fixed that easy. the strap also broke but a zip tie fixed it. don't get me wrong this it a tugh gun it's been drop, banged up and runs like new. so yea get it!!!!	1
B00006408K:not_very_helpful_if_you_use_cloth_diapers:l._richardson_"velouria9"	This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space.	0
B00005CDUR:not_like_the_first_one_-_but_still_very_cool:kc_"metroxing"	While Volume 1 of the DREAM BABES series is more accessible with its very girly girl group pop, sun-shiney vocals - Volume 2 offers a little bit of everything - from pop r&b, girl group vocals, pop, swinging pop & even some very early school grrl rock 'n roll - they might be a little more lyrically serious (hence the subtitle REFLECTIONS) but if anything, that's a good thing. It's nice to hear that women were trying different styles and genres and not just singing about about boys ...	1
B0002ZFQ5W:does_what_it_is_supposed_to_do!:raquel_hernandez_"raqui_from_the_bronx"	I love this item. Perfect for storing Pet Food. Special Screw type tops that seals food.  Bugs, Mice Cannot get in.  Easy to wash, let it air dry.  My only issue is that if it is screwed tightly you might have a problem opening it.  So those with out strong hands dont screw it to tightly closed.  Over all the best in Food Storage.  I know i just about bought them all	1

I set it up in my office (in a different pattern from what was shown) and it really adds a nice touch, especially with its blend of soothing smells.	1
408805	Too often in America we are fed news by deceiving journalists (such as those that work for Fox News). The Economist offers news with an agenda that does not always correspond to America's. It is a great resource for furthering ones knowledge of the world, from politics to economics to science to the arts. Best of all, the articles (except for the Special Report) are concise, allowing for an easy read.	1

My son still fits in the size % diapers but this is the one we specifically use at night and been really happy about it, no leaks, no gel coming out of the diaper and defintely a happy baby when he wakes up in the morning!	1
B00005JTW8:works_well_in_winter_and_on_eczema_and_dry_skin:e._raposa	I used Aveeno moisturizer and thought I would try something new.  I have eczema on my face (around my eyes, nose and mouth) in the winter and have no signs of it after a few days.  My skin is very sensitive, and have experienced burning with other products, but not this one.  I sinks in quickly and is not greasy feeling or heavy, yet strong enough to tackle dry skin.  I highly recommend it	1

They soak up the oil and I can tell after I throw the paper away.  Usually 1 sheet a day is all I need and my face is shine-free!  I love them!  I also like this product becuase you get 100 sheets which is the most I have seen so far.  I love this product and will buy again	1

150099	I remember going to great lengths to fit a matine showing of HEAVEN'S PRISONERS into a busy Saturday afternoon during its 1996 theatrical release. Considering the source material and the talent behind and in front of the camera, our little filmgoing party of detective-film fans and Alec Baldwin groupies (a.k.a. my mom, my stepfather, and me) found this contemporary film noir to be a big disappointment. Baldwin, who also served as co-producer, brought James Lee Burke's New Orleans ex-cop/recovering alcoholic hero Dave Robichoux from the printed page to the big screen. While Baldwin and the rest of the cast did well in fleshing out Burke's characters and have some tangy tough-guy/gal dialogue, they're hampered by two things:	0

524431	Office 97 was a pretty good product. The programs were powerful, had a decent interface (maybe not as good as the Claris products of the early 1990s, but not bad), and came with a ton of features all on one disc. The Office 98 release for Mac was pretty much the same thing. The only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant (paperclip) but it is easy enough to turn off.	0

213877	In Alan Alda's &quot;Betsy's Wedding&quot;,he is Eddie Hopper,a construction foreman and architect. His daughter Betsy(Molly Ringwald) and her boyfriend Jake Lovell(Dylan Walsh) announce their engagement at a family gathering. Betsy's sister Connie(Ally Sheedy) is happy herself but jealously upset because she can't find herself a man. The late Madeline Kahn is Lola,Eddie's wife. At the gathering Lola's sister Gloria Henner(Catherine O'Hara) tells her she plans to get even with her husband Oscar(Oscar winner Joe Pesci) for all his inept schemes. Gloria says &quot;Someday,when I have my nice little nestegg,I can take a walk and he can go f--- himself.&quot; Anthony LaPaglia is Stevie Dee,a guy who would later in the film become Connie's boyfriend. Stevie Dee's uncle Georgie(Burt Young) is a business associate of Oscar's. There's once scene where when Betsy and Jake meet with the man performing their wedding ceremony,the Dixie Cups' CHAPEL OF LOVE is played. They want to be pronounced &quot;husband and wife&quot; instead of &quot;man and wife&quot; and they have &quot;obey&quot; omitted from &quot;love,honor and obey&quot;. The late Julie Bovasso plays Rose,Eddie's mother and Joey Bishop is Eddie's deceased father. The father,as a ghost,is seen and heard only by Eddie. The wedding was somewhat disasterous. It took place in a rented tent on a rainy evening. The tent was made of cheap,not-too-strong materials so a hole in the roof where the rain fell into increased to the point where it caved in. After a heated argument between Gloria and Oscar at the reception also in the tent,Gloria pulls a loose thread causing the growing hole and the dowse of fallen rain. So Connie and Stevie Dee can be together more often,Stevie Dee applies to the police academy,since Connie's a cop. Unbelievably,the wedding dinner was pizza! By the way,Oscar planned to divorce Gloria and become romantically involved with his secretary,who also attended Betsy's and Jake's wedding. That was one of the things that led to the argument. The wedding ceremony was performed in the Jewish style. Jake stepped on a wine glass wrapped in a cloth napkin. This film was Alan Alda's most successful and not a minor hit like &quot;A New Life&quot;,another one of his personally scripted films	1
55133	I purchased this toy for my son when he was 4 months old.  At first, he seemed a little intimidated by the toys, and would cry when I put him in it.  Once he got used to it, he really enjoyed it.	1
215271	This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!	1
B0006V57H4:fun_but_wont_last:robert_lipsitz_"study_but_doubt,_question_and_be_ever_vigiliant"	Ok so my daughter was 2 3/4 and not 3 (toy rated for age 3), but she loves Elmo and loves playing with this toy. It is somewhat loud an there is no volume control. Also after 4 months of use the pen stopped working, rendering the toy worthless. Also the binding is weak and my daughter has torn the sheets with normal use. So fun toy while it lasts	0
B0000YUW4U:fantastic_iron:tamara_a._lakeman	I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal	1
466184	First, I'd like to say that I am so glad there are artists like Amel around who aren't trying to fit in with today's commercial R&B scene. As a long time fan of R&B and soul music I can't help but feel sad and dissapointed at the direction the genre is taking, especially in regards to female singers. She may be beautiful, but she doesn't need to use her looks to overcompensate for any lack of vocal talent by flaunting herself. Amel has a beautiful soul, and you can hear that through her wonderful voice and lyrics. Every song on this album has at some point or another touched me, some songs straight away while others grew on me slowly. You know how sometimes when you're listening to music and a particular lyric or vocal piece makes you shiver? Amel's got that down for me.	1
594049	My son is enthralled with this game!  He is learning while being entertained.  The graphics are exceptional, music is great, situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC!  What more could we ask for	1
6301491947:a_fine_film_featuring_absolutely_first_rate_comic_performances:robert_w._moore	MY FAVORITE WIFE is not among the very best comedies of pre-war Hollywood, but it is nonetheless quite excellent, driven by a strong script, superb lead performers, and a number of great character performances.  Cary Grant is the finest comic actor film has produced and this film demonstrates that as well as any.  Though he was equally as good in classics such as BRINGING UP BABY and THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, those films were so marvelously directed, so superbly well written, and filled with such an overabundance of great actors that one might not notice just how outstanding Grant was (that is not the case with HIS GIRL FRIDAY, where even among an embarrassment of riches, Grant stands out and dominates the film).  Here Grant is surrounded by fewer talented actors, is working with a slightly less superb (though still quite good) script, and is directed by the writer instead of the director originally scheduled for the project.  Originally the plan was to reunite Grant, Irene Dunne, and Leo McCarey, the big threesome of the classic 1937 screwball THE AWFUL TRUTH.  Unfortunately, McCarey had a car wreck just before shooting was begun and was unable to be on the set.  Canin did a good if not spectacular job.  Unlike his fellow writers Billy Wilder and Preston Sturges, both of whom became fulltime directors of their own scripts around this time, Canin primarily remained a writer for the rest of his career.	1
B000KBGJKE:what_a_bargain!:e._totaro	I love Birkenstocks and when I saw the Eaton Clog at such a low price, well, say no more.  Once you know your size, you can buy Birkenstocks from anywhere.  I just never expected to find them on amazon.com.  They're a little dressier style than my usual Bostons and I just love them	1
B0002DKCMQ:good_(if_not_always_clean)_fun...:daniela_enkelmann_"movie_buff"	I ordered this movie for my husband. He LOVES it!

So keep a sense of humor and enjoy	1

360238	After reading a number a positive reviews on the product, I wanted to try it.  I am glad I just went to my local Whole Foods Supermarket, instead of paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online.  Basically, I do Not like it...don't like the taste or texture; I am not really bothered by the smell once it is rinsed.	0
B000M4F9GO:lovely_colour:sofie_d	This is a camera that is very very easy to use. I was amazed by the colour quality even at a very low light.

Putting it onto my iMovie was also a piece of cake.	1

515399	I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one	0

B000FNAZ0C:small,_cheap,_easy_to_use,_but_ink_does_not_come_out_very_well.:c._kim	Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often	0
322896	Dwell is a unique (in my opinion) magazine and I like that. Unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design, this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style.  And as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra, I like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious.   Like in the April 2006 issue where Aloft in the Forest, where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown.  Using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements. Yes, the magazine has ads, but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there, fit the style of the magazine.  No fluffy dust catching junk	1

160529	I don't want to spoil this movie for others and I won't. CACHE is French for HIDDEN and  alot was left hidden. Why does the son suddenly do what he did? Why does he think his mother is doing what he thinks she's doing? I didn't care one bit about any of the charactors. This is a slow going movie with no conclusion. If you have a choice between watching this movie or watching paint dry, flip a coin. I watch international films often and usually fnd them more rewarding than most US made films. Not this one.	0

B000G6IPFU:bad_game:	This game can get very boring. It's very confusing and hard to control. It is sooooo frustrating!!!!!!!!! The instruction booklet doesn't come in handy either. Like some other people, I only got rabbits too. I bought this game because I wanted to heal cats and horses. But, only rabbits came. Buying this game was a big mistake. It is reallly no fun. Don't waste your money on this game. I gave up about a month ago. I've left it on the shelf and haven't touched it since.	0

The stories are alot of fun to read and it really encourages us to learn and talk about animals that we wouldn't if we did not receive the magazine. After we read it my daughter enjoys making collages from her favorite pictures.	1
B000GDTQXS:good_stuff_so_far:f._harrison	I got this bed topper a couple weeks ago to place on my older matress.  It was pretty pungent, but it felt so good the first time I layed in it.  after a couple days it appeared to lose it's memory and start to dent and crease, but eventually it got back to full expansion.  The customer service with this item was fantastic!	1

It's not the plushest stroller, however, for travel or quick errands it's perfect for us	1
B000K0X90I:great_little_phone!__but...:b._longwell	This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music	1

I have been told by the customer support people @ Schwinn/Bowflex - since the middle of February - that a replacement is on it's way (even the "supervisor" said this to me).  Hear that ticking?  Yeah, that's the clock on my warranty - it is just going away without ever even getting a chance to try the thing out.  Am I happy...NO!!  Maybe I'll write another review when I get my new console and I can tell you how wonderful this piece of equipment is - until then - I'm one heck of a ticked off customer.  Save yourself the headache and just go to the gym	0
B000HCZ8EO:hideous_software:snaildarter_"snaildarter"	This is the worst thing since the Office Assistant animated paper clip.  Forcing the "ribbon" on the user assumes that the user likes icons (I don't -- what's wrong with words??), and fills too much of the screen real estate.  Nothing is where it should be.  And what arrogance on the part of Microsoft to provide no alternate views, no "classic" view, just these piles and piles of inscrutable icons.  Another oppressive, giant waste of my time and money at the hands of Microsoft.	0
232938	There's a reason why they talk about the "Voice of an Angel" -- it's because Charlotte Church certainly doesn't have the acting presence of one.

B00006I5ZW:one_of_the_best_ball_point_refills_around_-_reason_enough_to_buy_waterman:dom_miliano	Fundamentally, the reason we use a pen is to write on paper, right? And the component of the pen that affects how a ball point pen writes is the refill. So when I bought a Waterman pen for the design, I was happily surprised that the refill was great. The ink flows smoothly. It doesn't blob. It has a high capacity and is offered at a decent price.	1
B000067JEU:very_different_story_line:mark_"gay_brother"	I really did like this movie and the different kind of story. It was very imaginative and well acted. The story was very scarey at times and gorey as well. The only problem with the movie is that the director covered up Ezra Godden's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie. Other than that, if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god Dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town's people peeling off the faces of it's visitors then this movie is for you	1

This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!

415677	It is now almost a month since I bought the upgrade to XP Prof. for my destop computer running W2K Prof. I have had nothing but trouble. My notebook computer, connected by a wireless next for almost 18 months, suddenly could not connect to the desktop. All network setup and trouble-shooting help did nothing. I called MS and things got worse. Now I have an dditional problem (no sound on my desktop) and the first problem remains unsolved. I have been through three layers of MS technicians, only the last of which spoke English with an accent close enough to mine to be understood. Nonce could fix the problems and they are now "researching" the problem and supposed to call me this morning. During one of the calls, the tech. tried to blame it on my notebook. If any of you are old enough to remember when there was only one telephone company, you'll ercognize the situation. Right now, I would prefer getting a refund and returning to W2K	0

212411	This is my favorite jazz album of all time.  Put simply, this was Miles Davis at his best.  The notes on this album simply float, and yet it flows together better than anything I've ever heard.  The composition is disorganized but in a way that it all makes complete sense.  Don't let the thirty second clips fool you.  I almost missed out on this because the clips are misleading.  I took a chance on it, and it was the best gamble I've ever made.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast	1

B000MKYKAO:please_end_it!:a._v._neal_"mamot"	I didn't have especailly high hopes for this book. I think there has been a gradual decline in the quality of HH books over the years, and this one brings it to a new low. Basically, it's waaaaaay too long. At 850 pages, it's a monster read, and a slow one. That's not always a bad thing - sometimes if you like the characters it's nice to just hang out with your friends for page after page. But not here. Why is it necessary to describe in detail the exact movements of a treecat using sign language? For several paragraphs? More than once? Why are we given pages of liturgy for religious services? I think I'd be in a very small minority when I confess that I quite like the 1662 Prayer Book, though I can't quite work out why it would be revived in the distant future when it's been out of use here for decades! Maybe it was easy to cut and paste, and got the word count up.	0

B0000646VF:a_fantastic_overview:	This CD provides a fantastic overview of Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now.  The tracks range from pieces with an &quot;electric Miles&quot; sound to an orchestrated track.  While very diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions.  The infamous ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.  Informative liner notes as well.  Highly recommended	1

B000AMON38:piece_of_junk!:harrkev_"harrkev"	My wife and I both got this phone at the same time.  I chose it because it claims to be rugged, and the price was right.  Well, we have had them for around six months, and they are both not working right.  My wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case, so her i560 now wears pink.  Shortly after, it started resetting itself randomly.  She would pick it up, just to find that she needed to enter the SIM password.  Over time it started doing it more and more.  At first I believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change, but later my phone started doing the same thing.  Now, my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day.  I absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect.  Anybody can ship one bad product, but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable.  Shame on Motorola	0
471104	I first encountered Bird3 opening for Veruca Salt the summer of 2001.  That band had put their faith into Bird and so have I.  We fell in love with them all together.  This band has successfully combined infectious pop hooks with soul-baring lyrics to create something unique, beautiful, and far from most of the trite pop or rock music you hear on the radio today.  You'll find yourself not only humming along, but holding this music close to your heart at your most intimate moments.  You will not once regret buying this piece of art	1

560022	Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path	0

290710	I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.

B000I4LEGC:16:9_stretching_problem_workaround:s._bayles_"heagan"	This frame looks great until you turn it on. The picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. When you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. What does that mean you ask? That means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. You will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; This will not take advantage of the entire frame. If you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. I have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. See below.	0

69541	I can't believe that other reviewers are calling the moves in this video "easy to master".  I found some of them to be nearly impossible to follow.  The camara barely focuses on her feet as she perfoms intricate latin dance footwork!  I am an athletic twenty-three year old girl who is not a slow learner.  I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.

377260	It's fascinating to compare my own experiences, having lived now 3 years in Germany, to those of an American from 125 years earlier.  I've been learning to speak German, and his Appendix on the "awful" German language was hilarious.  In poking fun at German grammar (e.g., long sentences), he purposely commits the same errors in his own writing.  The scene "riding" the glacier down the Alps was so funny I had tears running down my face.  It's amazing to think that it was written in 1879, when America was barely a century old, and the insights and perceptions then can be incredibly, eerily similar to either my or "typical" American's attitudes today.	1

6305295840:we_want_it_on_dvd,_please:jesse_nelson_"scazzy"	Why the record company would put this out on VHS, and not DVD, is beyond me, especially considering its release date. The ultimate would be (and they have done it before, see both the Doors and Sepultura DVD releases) to take this, and add to it, Live at Brixton, and put it all on one DVD. Since this doesn't seem likely, I suggest, burn your own DVD, and include not only "Ricochet" and "Another Bloody Murder" (both left out), but also Mr. Bungle's one music video release. Happily, while "Stripsearch" is not listed on the back of the VHS box, it is included. FNM videos? GREAT, GREAT, GREAT..	1
277045	I liked these.  I was prepared for an awful stench upon opening the package, but mine didn't smell at all.  I followed the instructions and was pleasantly suprised by the taste and unique (unique = good) texture.  These noodles weren't like pasta, but they were good.  I'll have no problem eating them agian.  As a matter of fact I thought they were quite delicious	1
B0006A7Y08:sharp-looking_tank_top:d._furlong_"dustygirl"	I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38.	1
B00005BC7T:soft,_lame,_sissy..:	Who in the world called this ''Hard Rock''?!???????????!!? This is a bunch of self-pitying, mainstream jibberish..nothing interesting at all. I shall dub this as ''Alternative Whine''.	0
B0002CZVKA:big_muff_is_it!:o._lovitt_"clay212"	Everyone has known for a good while that if you wanted *clean*  *distortion* get the Big Muff, no question. It is I'm happy to say the same and really better. I bought my second just a bit ago having heard of the sustain feature for the first time. Not to gild the lily but I'll be dipped. It makes it better.	1
B000002UJO:5_or_6_excellent_tunes_rather_than_the_usual_2_or_3:carlspannard	This is their best album.Easily better than anything the likes of Oasis ever managed.Richard III,Going Out,Late In The Day and the title track are all top quality.If you rated Blurs 3 &quot;Britpop&quot;(horrible term really) albums from the 90s then get this.Its up there with them.Simple as that	1
B0002EXVNC:automatic_dish_dumping_rack:e._spohn	Unless you're planning on washing dinner plates only, this dish rack is not for you. Smaller plates (or bowls for that matter) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips ( about 1/8 inch )so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open (3 1/4 inches) . Anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor. The utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom. I bought this thinking that since Polder has a good name, it would be a good product. I was wrong and Polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design	0

B000IBVVL8:expression_web_for_the_professional:david_a._kovar_"dakovar"	I find MS's Expression Web to be a huge step up for the professional web designer from FrontPage.  FrontPage 2003 was extremely nice and very usable by informal web developers, but the code view really wasn't much better than notepad (...not that I have a problem with notepad!).  [...]  I highly recommend it for the professional web designer	1
B000HCVR30:worth_the_effort_to_retrain_yourself!!!!:bg	MS put Office 2007 on a DVD rather than a CD so there is only one disk, so they make the installation easier right off the bat. Unlike all previous versions of Office, you do not have to get into the details of what options you want. In previous versions, if you didn't make sure you installed all the features, when you went to do a function that wasn't installed, you had to dig out your Office disks and install the feature. A huge pain, but not anymore.	1

394484	Too many Christians are ignorant of our rich past.  We know a lot about the 1st Century and the current times, but everything in between is somewhat blank.

B0007LEG2K:save_money_on_car_repair:mr._doctor	I bought this reader when my engine light came on. Turns out I could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part. The dealership was going to charge me over $100	1
B000A2AGZC:check_compatability:michael_e.dorsey	The item was not difficult to install but the adaptor plate did not fit my tv so I called peerless customer service and they had one sent to me but that cost me another 40 bucks. I was disappointed it was NOT as universal as advertised. once I got the tv up it is ok, and getting the tv up to it is a 3 person job and it takes two to lift it up as it should  for safety reasons but a 3rd person needs to hold the arm steady. I did find out there is another one that could have fit without having to spend the extra 40 bucks. I had to return the first tv to the store and round up help when I got a replacement. Now it looks like I may need to do that again as the replacement tv has problems also.This whole thing with the mount and tv has been very frustrating.	0
B000AF786O:very_small_and_to_the_point:brian_peyton_"bmp1967"	wife loves this contraption.  if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall.  easy to  clean. and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when I purchased one.  sweet.  cup it comes with is great quality.  peace!	1

B000H6FA84:professional_display:halina_bojarski	I purchased this item to show my work to potential buyers. I found that it is effective to show many of my pieces, and the materials used to make this folder is exceptional.  Very professional looking and easy to carry around.  If you have a ton of items then they tend to get tangled, but I don't believe it is intended for that purpose	1
463384	I work on the news for a local highschool, and i am always about writing things down. I keep 4 new molskine notebooks in my desk at all times. I uasualy keep them in my back pocket, and sitting in classes all day with the notebook in my pocket can basicly destroy it. And i have killed quite a few of them this way. But thats my fault. They are the perfect size for your back pocket and dont get in the way too much. It would be nice if they had a stronger version of the book, for thoes who are a bit tougher on their stuff, something like riveted pages to the cover. I rebind mine all of the time, but keep in mind they get thrown down staircases, dropped on the street, and chucked into trash cans by some crazy student. Basicly because im always on the move, taping events, filming movies, and everything i have so much going on i dont have time to worry about how my notebook is going to hold up, and the Moleskine line does a good job at putting up with everything i can throw at it. I use them to record my daily notes, and use them for story boarding. The cover is tough, and the elastic extremely helpful. The back pocket is very good for keeping business cards in, i can pull out a card at the same time i write a note down! :	1

B000FKJS6C:the_worst_i've_taken:j._l_schreiber	I got this product to help me sleep and it did NOT work for me.  I used to take some pain killer/sleep aid made by Members Mark and that worked great, but I no longer need the pain killer.  I bought this and have tried it 3 times now, and I can't quite explain it but it did not make me tired.  It made me feel relaxed and more of a false tired, plus it made my sleepless leg syndrome act up all three times I used it.  Not only did it not make me drowsy, I couldn't sleep and I woke up several times during the night.  I think I would have done better without it.  But everyone reacts to drugs differently, so try at your own risk	0
B000GT6O6O:anger_management_fails...:lyuba	I watched Anger Management on the plane. Since there is nothing else to watch, and the flight is more than ten hours, you usually watch whatever is on T.V. I thought that this movie as a whole was pretty bad, though there are some funny parts. There is some offensive language. Overall, it's a bad movie and is not worth watching.	0
B000GKYCLW:same_problem:carrie	We were excited for the first bunch of stickers and then my 5 year old wanted to try it himself.  It jammed up and that was the end of it.  There are no instructions on how to fix it so I threw the cartridge away.  Don't waste your money	0

181323	You know what?  I absolutely hate it when people say that this game was hard.  I beat it on normal in one week! And this was when it first came out, when I was about twelve years old our around there maybe thirteen.  But, anyway this game was so fun! I got it the week it came out and that Christmas vacation, me and my brothers were glued to the computer playing that game, or at least watching me play it.  I have beaten that game five times now and it never gets old	1
B00004R7N8:stiff_upper_lip:steven_sly	I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are clich ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts	0

B0009X4ZNQ:great_for_the_shower:s._larson	We really like this dish.  It allows soap and water to drain through... you won't have the soap scum problem.  It looks great and has rubber on the bottom and it won't slide around on you.	1

B000FZ4ROU:nice_addition_to_the_world_of_hiking_and_camping:jeff_edwards_"radiojeff"	First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.	1
378352	Very good stealth type game. This game is really addicting and keeps you playing. Its a really intense game, and gets harder level by level. One of them games where it makes you think, you gotta think what your next move should be. Like coming up to a room and theres 2 guards patrolling it, should you take them out? Or sneak past them? Alot of stuff like that. Hands down a really fun game	1
357818	This is the best PC gaming magazine you'll find anywhere. It covers the lastest games and hardware. A bonus, the issue comes with a free demo disc every month. Although PC games are fading out of the picture, XBOX is a good way to keep them alive. This magazine covers everything you need to know. It's the best thing to do if you want the most out of your PC. A good choice to start with is this. Get this magazine, your won't regret it	1
B00005QFKK:outstanding_product:kathryn_k._burns_"kathryn_k_olivier"	I am extremely happy with this product.  It works like a charm for making pancakes and they never ever stick.  It's a superb design and I am very pleased.  I would highly recommend it	0
B000JF6168:very_small_case:j.'s_mommy	This is a nice looking brown suede camera case.  Based on all the Stylus models listed, I assumed my Olympic Stylus 595 would fit in it but, unfortunately, it does not.	0
B000F2WVDW:awsome_m16:t._gardner	I got it about 2 months ago and it still works like new. i even left it in a shed uncovered and it still works great. It look very real, but the only bad thing is that the sclincer does nothing to the sound of the gun. THIS GUN IS AWESOME!!!!!	1
49754	Don't listen to the reviews that claim that this lens is not a good choice for cropped sensor cameras (IE the 20D, 30D, Rebels etc) the Canon L lens are the best and this particular lens is no exception. I have had the lens for less than 24 hours now and am in love with the sharpness and color already.	1
B000EF1KB4:a_nice_little_smoker:jason_jackson_"jason_lee_jackson"	I found this smoker to be great.  I am not a pro, so take my opinion as such.  I bought this last week and put it together in about a 1/2 hour.  The only problem I had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke, which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly.  It was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix, and was probably my fault for forcing it.  I plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week.  The rest of the unit looks well built.	1
B0000CDZDM:pharaonic_guardian_is_awesome!:brianna_"bri_t85"	This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack	0
B000FPVUY0:very_easy:albert_"albert"	This chocolate was great - the first time I used a fondue fountain I used chocolate chips - I had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot, then add oil to it in order to use it - I ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing - then someone told me about using liquid chocolate - it was so much easier you just have to pour it in.  And the taste was amazing - if I didnt find this I probably would never have used my fountain again..	1
B00062A8FY:beautiful_and_long_lasting_lip_gloss:a._wagoner	This lip gloss is super!!!  Not only does it glide on your lips, it has staying power.  The colors are so subtle and pretty.  It is worth every penney and I will not waste my money on cheaper, sticky and short-lived lip glosses	1
B00063RXLA:wrong_size:j._rusk	This item is not nine inches wide.  It is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan, but costs ten dollars more.  So you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size.  Hopefully, the item description will be changed soon.  Now, I have to pack up and ship back several of these, but at least Amazon is paying the freight.  Lodge Logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though.  I think this is just a random error.  Just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7.99.  The cornsticks will be the same size	0
B00005331R:natrual_gentle_cleanser_:naoki_"naoki"	I am a woman of color and this product eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my combination skin. I highly recommend this product for women who need to brighten their appearance once a week.	1
500190	Now that I'm writing this review, it seems silly that I'm so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush.  But I am.  I bought this item not long after I had my first (and hopefully only) root canal and crown four years ago, something which I never again want to experience in my life (as someone else described, it was painful and expensive).  Growing up, I didn't take care of my teeth like I should've, so I'm accustomed to always being told there's either a cavity, or the start of one, and having to have more work done.	1

B000CRCNLU:broken_after_two_days:melody_lumpkin	I installed this mirror in our car two days ago.  Today it was in my daughter's lap when I went to get her out of the car.  The mirror broke off from the base.  I bought it because it seemed safer than the other types of mirrors (suction cup attachment, etc).  I would not recommend this product	0
B000659KBO:awesome_grill.:p._starr	You can't go wrong buying this great grill.  It was a snap to put together with easy to follow instructions.  It heats up super fast and cooks with wonderful efficency.  No cold spots as far as I can tell so far on any parts of the cooking surface and flame-ups are kept to a minimum.  You won't be dissapointed if you bring this baby home	1
B0000Y3O0E:friends_said_my_"face_looked_younger":a._filskov	I read many positive (and very few negative) reviews before I ordered my first tube.  I am 65 living in Florida and  have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months.  The cream goes on smoothly, and I have had no negative reaction.  Friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking, with less wrinkles.  In fact two friends, based on my favorable experience, are also planning to purchase Kinerase	1

B00006KJE8:amazing!:you_know_me	This magazine is amazing!!  It keeps getting better and better, unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as Muscle & Fitness. It's a shame it doesn't have more readers! If you like the mag then pass it around, people work hard to put it together! A great buy!	1
B00004R8YO:won't_make_thick_froth_so_don't_bother:j._webster	I purchased this BonJour frother to replace my old AeroLatte frother.  The difference between the two brands is startling!  The BonJour frothing tip is a solid wavy metal tip which actually OVER-froths the milk.  This causes the bubbles to keep breaking down.  I can only achieve a very thin layer of foam and it won't last long.  On the othe hand, the Aerolatte frothers(also widely available with several models on Amazon) uses more of an open-metal mesh tip on their wand which must be responsible for how thick and dense a foam it will create.  I'm buying another Aerolatte and will use the BonJour wand for things that don't need thick foam (like mixing salad dressing)	0
B000HZEPJ0:missing_episodes:sebastiano_"scc"	This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is..	0
B000059T4T:one_of_the_best_ever!:dorothyanne_"movie_classic"	Do I mean the best album or the best singer?  You are correct if you said both!  I saw Kristin Chenoweth on a PBS show "Broadway's Best at the Pops," (though it was not the first time I had heard her) and decided to check out the offerings here.  This is a collection of the kind of music and performances I love.  She has a great range, a precise pitch, and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself. In an era when singers try to outdo each other re-interpreting the composer's original work, not usually with great success, she is a blessing	1

91932	I just can't say enough good things about the Brainy Baby series of videos and toys.  I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.	1
1581700334:absolutely_sensational:love_to_school_"kaye"	I wanted this Bible for Mother's Day after I did not get it I ordered it on June 25 and got it rather quickly.  Enough said about the wonderful shipping time with Amazon Prime.	1
B000CMD4SG:low_quality_gummi_bears:david_pearlman_"sound_fanatic"	I bought a case of these from Amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of "excellent" quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like Haribro.	0

B000056HNZ:great_for_part_time_pumping:rachel_taylor	I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it.  He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems.  I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing.  I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.	1
B0000530HZ:a_timeless_scent:	My grandfather found a vial of Old Spice in his Navy kit when he joined in 1943. He continued using it after the war and my father picked it up when he himself came of age. I began shaving about ten years ago and choice was obvious: Old Spice is conservative and masculine, distinct and time-honored. It's not a trend; it's a statement of manhood. If Proctor &amp; Gamble obliges, my own grandkids will be using it	1
B000EI2NV2:good_design_badly_executed:ben_snyder_"tom_mix"	I bought the trailer to take my granddaughter with me when I rode on vacation When I assembled the trailer, the chain was twisted.  I bought a chain tool to break the chain and straighten it.	0
B0000AHSA1:great_at_home_kit:m._reyes	I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  She loves it. She is able to do her nail easily.  The nail attachments work really well and strong, the only thing the attachments for callous do not really work that well they have to be at a certain angle and work so so, but the rest of the attachments are excellent certainly worth the price for those alone.Compact size, easy to store and quick charge time	1

I tried this one and now I am hooked.  It is wonderful if you like bold coffee, which I do.  I also like the fact that it is Organic.  I don't drink a lot of coffee each day, but the cup or two I have, I want to be great.  Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	1
B000970B12:best_concealer:tale_"jt"	This is the best concealer I have ever worn.  It covers well without making me look fake or cakey around the eyes.  Not greasy either.  The powder that comes with this is a nice touch for traveling.  However, I gave this a four star because it is pricey.  Amazon should try and give customers discounts.	1
B000022TSF:how_to_make_a_detective_movie:jack_bass	This is simply one of the best detective story ever made and Jerry Goldsmith's sound track ( which I also own) is probaby the best sound track. It was his favorite. Jack , Faye & John are at their best	1

B00007E8D1:sunpak_383_super:mark_1_stab	This flash is the perfect back-up for a studio, or Main/flash fill for an amateur studio.  I use several w/slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of Dollars.  I like that they are light and easy to pack and transport.  They are reasonably priced.  They have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles.  The SUNPAK has auto/f-stop and manual.  If you are a real photographer, you will know how to use them.  The down side is that if your SUNPAK is plugged into a wall, it takes far too long to recharge (sometimes 3-5 seconds).  Rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes.	1

B000H3AC7G:nice_portable_hoop,_but_assembly_was_not_easy:lincoln_hooper	I purchased this for Christmas for my 8 year old son to play with.  It was $329 with free shipping compared to $450 at the local sports store.  The finished product looks great, appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust.  I only gave it 4 stars because assembly was not easy, and I am mechanically inclined. Practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous.  It was a 4 hour assembly, with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience.  But the smile on the 8 year old's face was well worth the aggravation.	1

B000000508:a_25_mic_classic:joehiphophead	This was one of the first Hiphop albums I ever purchased and I still listen to it today I think that krs's style was best suited to Primos production. Once he lost Primo (with the exception of a few albums) he couldnt hold it anymore musicly. krs didnt care about the latest trends in music or about bein a thug or topping the pop charts he just showed his incredible talents on the mic and stomped all the wack MCs that deserved it. This was also the album that introduced the world to krs as a solo artist and he proved that he had plenty of ammunition left from his BDP days as well as few musical/lyrical tricks up his sleeve This album along with any other BDP release should be considerd mandatory listening for all you youngsters out there who are just getting into Hiphop this was the era that I belive Hiphop was the best about 93-98 its a shame that kris is doing the crap hes doing now I wish he would find a better producer or just stop doing albums and continue his carrer as a live battle rapper.	1
B000050B5P:low_coverage:shomag	We now have the 4.2 gallon humidifer, as well as the air softener, all Vornado, and this one is most disappointing.  The construction is a bit flimsy, but my biggest complaint is the area coverage.  The unit is supposed to support at least a 600 sq ft space.  We have it in our master bedroom which is smaller than this and the air still feels very dry in our bedroom even after we've been running it for 2 days now non-stop on the high setting.  Granted, I have a pretty heightened sensitivity to the moisture in the air in our bedroom given I have a cold and nasal congestion, but I expected more from this unit given our satisfaction with the other.  We run the air softener on our 1st floor, which covers several rooms and it definitely maintains a level of moisture there very well.  The 4.2 unit is in our basement, which again covers several room and that one also has met our satisfaction.  We bought this because we needed one just for our master bedroom and we are pretty disappointed.  We have radiator heat and are suffering through the cold winter of Chicago right now.	0
197529	I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.	1
B0007PHOZ2:scoop_and_lofty_at_the_building_yard_-great_toy:mom_of_two_boys	We just got this lego system for our 3 year old son and he loves it!  He doesn't want to put it away or out of his sight at any time.  The Scoop and Lofty characters are easy for him to assemble and we are working on the little buildings, but he may not be quite old enough yet to assemble them.  Overall, this is a great toy for anyone who loves Bob the Builder.  We can't wait to purchase the other sets to add to the fun!!  Lego always makes great and challenging toys!	1

B000BN3A4Y:cheap_life_insurance!:john_talley	After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance	1
B0000ALFAZ:a_worthless_piece_of_junk:charlie_russel_"osgeek"	Not worth one star! Lasted about 1 week, and then started emitting a high pitched whine loud enough to wake people in the next town. It is now officially DEAD and USELESS. Even the short while it "worked" it was almost useless. Switching speed and mouse response was frankly terrible, the keyboard lagged several characters behind my typing and fitting the cables into it was simply not possible. DO NOT BUY THIS.

After several choice words and approximately 2 1/2 hours later per bike (5 hours total), I finally had this piece of crap installed, only to find out that both my and my wife's heels grinded against the footrests of the seat.  DO NOT buy this piece of crap, it is not worth any amount of money as far as i'm concerne	0

If the numbers referenced above show in the review, you can see that my model of camera does not appear.  In spite of this ANTOLINE has refused to issue an RMA for its return and replacement with the correct case and has stated they will refuse it if I return without their RMA. They tell me it cannot be sold as new since it was opened.  The only packaging was a brown padded envelope.  Is there another way of seeing inside the envelope without opening it? I guess I could go to the airport and put it through the screener.	0

And yet I find it very entertaining!  Although I'll never be able to afford even one of their recommended outfits, and I'm usually a full 180 degrees opposite of their political views, I find their articles interesting, well-written, and insightful.  I must admit, I should hate Esquire, because the editors and writers would find me disgusting.  But somehow I look forward to seeing it in my mailbox every month.  The writers, if nothing else, are intelligent, which is more than I can say for the writers in most guy magazines like FHM and Maxim	1

605058	There is no doubt that Antonia Fraser's "The Journey" is written in the author's usual wry, witty and highly engaging style (although I must say that I never before heard of sex described as "lugubrious.") There is also no doubt that Fraser has done a great deal to redeem Marie-Antoinette's shredded reputation by accurately describing her as being compassionate to the hardships of the French people. The book is full of vivid detail which makes it very readable. However, I was disappointed to see that Fraser resorts to many popular misconceptions. For one thing, why does Fraser act like Marie Antoinette was the only princess to be sent away from home as a teenager to seal a dynastic marriage? What about Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst (Catherine the Great) who was also a young stranger in a foreign land? This sort of thing happened all the time - it was what being a princess was all about. I was glad that Fraser did not fall into the myth of Louis XVI's impotence/ phimosis and surgery and all that. She simplistically portrays him as being asexual, which was not true, because he told his aunt after consummating his marriage that he enjoyed "it." But never has any other biographer subjected the reader to the spectacle of Fersen and the queen fiddling with  primitive prophylactics while consummating their grand passion. I must say, it is a first. Fraser insists that Marie Antoinette slept with Fersen for many years and yet gives no solid proof, while at the same time maintaining that she was a woman of high moral character. I usually do not think of a woman who is shared by both a lover and a husband as having a high moral character, but I guess Fraser does. Oh, well. It is such romantic fantasies that turn this book into more of a soap opera than a serious biography. I found it absurd when Fraser insists that the tormented queen of France was ultimately a martyr for the cause of the socialism and democracy which the French people now enjoy. If the queen had had her way, her descendant would be reigning today, and that is just the reality of it. For a better study of Marie Antoinette's relationship with her husband, I would recommend Vincent Cronin's "Louis and Antoinette." As for better biographies of the queen, let me join some fellow reviewers in the hope that the works of Delorme and Bertieres will soon be available in English	0

B00083HKH0:not_durable._mattel_not_what_it_used_to_be.:p._m_palmer_"phil"	This toy, like several other Mattel toys I've purchased in the past 5 years are difficult to put together, troublesome to play with, and not durable. I wish Mattel would think more about the kids playing with their toys and less about the stockbrokers. Toys can be easy to assemble. Intuitive to play with and rugged as a tank. It just depends on priorities of the toy design/builder	0
B0002U2RKY:body_ball_blue_65cm:lin	The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.	0
B0002JETPQ:great_product:m._baran	Use this gate for our 9 month old son we have an extra wide opening. One minor drawback is the screws seem to get a little loose and have to be tightened every once in awhile. All and all it is a very good product	1

243763	I ordered this blower/vac after reading many reviews on many different blowers. I must say that it is doing an outstanding job this fall! We have MANY deciduous trees and I was worried about cleanup this fall. The blower is powerful enough to move bulky leaves into a pile. It easily blows off the porch, concrete drive and gravel drive. The vac part works well and I am glad to have the metal impeller blade as I occasionally vac up small pine cones and liquid ambar balls with out damage to the blade so far... The mulching ratio may be correct with dry leaves but I find the damp or still fresh leaves only mulch to a 1:6 ratio - still not bad I a use the leaves for mulch and compost addition. I have not had a clogging problem with the blade.  It is a little loud (don't know how it compares to a gas one) and alot dusty and a bit heavy once the bag is full, but that is the nature of leaf cleanup!	1

207771	My gripe is about KQ6.  One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset	0

B000LXXJ1I:so_far,_so_wonderful!!!:p._bostrom	I RECENTLY RECIEVED MY NEW CAMERA, AND I AM THRILLED.  I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING WHICH CAMERA TO BUY SINCE DECEMBER (WHEN OUR LAST CAMERA WENT CAPOOT).  THERE HAVE BEEN MIXED REVIEWS FOR THE OLYMPUS SW SERIES, BUT COULD NOT RESIST THE APPEAL OF THIS CAMERA'S UNIQUE FEATURES.  I CANNOT WAIT TO TAKE IT INTO THE POOL THIS SUMMER WITH THE KIDS.  SO FAR, THE POINT AND SHOOT OPTIONS AND PICTURES HAVE BEEN LOVELY.  ANY PERSON CAN SCREW UP PICTURES WITH ANY CAMERA, BUT THIS CAMERA HAS SO MANY FEATURES TO AVOID THAT.  MY HUSBAND AND I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME TAKING EXTREME CLOSE UP SHOTS OF OUR GARDEN.  I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT QUALITY, AND HAD THAT MUCH SATISFACTION FROM A CAMERA SINCE WE FIRST SWITCHED OVER TO DIGITAL.  I AM VERY PLEASED, TO SAY THE LEAST, WITH THIS PURCHASE.	1
B000EJS9IM:dynamic_unit!:rc	This unit is even better than I had expected. I read the reviews of those who have used it and decided that it was the better of the B&D's that were also available.  A little pricier, but with the many features, it makes it worth the all-in-one package.  I was surprised it had DC plugs (for things you usually plug into the lighter).  Mostly I was looking for A/C plugs, and a jump-starting capability (for road trips, camping, etc.).	1

548176	As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet.  However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored.  The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about.  The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic.  I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted	0

B0002Z9QNU:so_far,_so_good._looks_great.:erwin_r._campos_ruiz_"erwin"	First of all '11 cubic feet' means a little for me so if you were wondering about the dimesions of this bag, look no further (because nor even in lund's web site you could find this valuable information). The dimensions labeled in the box are 44"x36"x16" (l,w,h). So far I stuffed it with six letter size stackable white cardboard boxes like those you find at Office Depot (15.5"x12.5"x11") intended for your backlog (by Willamette), it's not easy at first glance but, believe it or not, there's enough room for them. Te curb of the aerodinamic shape ends some 18" from the front side to the back to reach the 16" claimed. For me it seems like a parabolic shape because the height continues to increase slightly up to around 18" in the backside. With my 6 backlog boxes in place there's still some 26"x36"x5" of room above them.	1
366725	Back in the 1970's my grandmother subscribed to Prevention. At that time, it was a wonderful magazine, filled with informative articles aimed at the "Prevention" of illness and the promotion of wellness (as the founder of Prevention, J.I. Rodale had preached). Articles about the role of vitamins and nutrition were light years ahead of their time. (J.I. can be given a lot of credit for bringing vitamins and supplements to the mainstream). Over the years, and especially after the tragic death of Robert Rodale (J.I.'s son), and the takeover by his wife and daughter, it has unfortunately transformed into a fluffy, tabloid-like "women's magazine" with scantily clad women on the covers, and one- or two-page articles instructing women to get killer abs and burn the fat. I think J.I. Rodale is probably spinning in his grave to see what his descendents have done to butcher this magazine, which bears NO resemblence whatsoever to what it used to be. I flipped through a copy in disgust recently to note, as another reviewer has stated, plenty of ads for DRUGS which really seems to go against the idea of preventing illness in the first place (whereas the old Prevention sang the praises of vitamins and health foods). I don't know why the Rodale family doesn't just scrap the title and call it something else, but alas, they are a major corporation now and I have little hope that this magazine will improve any time soon	0
B00005OSLQ:i_feel_like_i've_tripped_on_to_a_nice_little_secret:andy_orrock	I enjoyed Francis Veber's 'The Closet' - released in France in 2001 - for two reasons.

470035	Actually I felt I was in love with this film as soon as I saw the very beginning - the opening credits against the background of Chicago seen from high above and provided with beautiful music. "Candyman" could have become another teenage urban legend flick with not much of a sense, but Bernard Rose managed to squeeze everything possible from the story making a brilliant, enchanting and spellbinding film out of it. If you're interested mostly in gore and some physical manifestations of horror you won't find it here (you will, but not in quantities you used to). "Candyman" is more of a psychological horror where atmosphere is what's important, where mood is what matters, where you are given some food for thought. I don't have enough words to describe the whole perfection of this gorgeous film, I can only say it's a great achievement of Bernard Rose as a director besides I guess Tony Todd, Virginia Madsen and Xander Berkeley had their best roles played in this feature.	1

B000FT1XZW:works_pretty_well,_not_completely_cool_to_the_touch:yankee_dave	I got this for our 3-year-old daughter's room as for some reason she does not seem to like the sound of a radiant heater. It does a decent job of boosting the heat level in the room, which she needs because she tends to kick off her blankets during the night. I wouldn't rely on this alone to heat a room unless it was a very small room. The top and back do get hot, although you'd have to keep your skin in contact with it for several seconds to actually get burned; bumping into it should not cause any burns. I haven't noticed any odors or noises from it	1

190360	This is the easiest way I've ever been able to make CD's. It realy makes photo CD's easy and produces a great product. A group of frinds and Us just got back from Mexico and I put all of everyones photos in separate files on a CD. The automatic slide show goes through the differn't files as if they were just one file with no seperation, but the pictures are still separated in each person's file for ease when printing and so forth. It's great, wish I would have had this years ago	1

B000002MVH:the_illusion_of_a_mature_mitchell:marco_tognato	i deeply love the music of joni mitchell. it is for this reason that i feel the need to warn you, to dissuade you from being too early enthusiastic about this album aven before having heard it (as i stupidly did). the fact is that so many people spend so much energy in praising it (a new mature joni! a return to the roots! a brilliant acoustic album! and nonsense like these...) that it is very disappointing and frustrating to see (well, hear) that joni has not changed from her foolish and useless music of the last 15 years (except "dog eat dog" which is superb, but only from a lyrical point of view - musically it's an '80s disaster). it is the first joni mitchell album that i felt spleepy listening. ok, some lyrics are quite good, but nothing compares to the joni of the '60s and '70s. so, i really do not get the point: it is so obvious to me that she has nothing left to say (how painful it is to face reality!), so, why should all of you praise her? just because of what she did in the past? ok, let us say that she WAS the greatest singer-songwriter of her generation (according to me, much better than bob dylan) and let us praise her forever because of that; but i truly cannot accept that we still flatter her in everything she does, even if what she does is boring and flat music pretending to be art. i would like to strongly dissuade you from buying this album (and anything else from 1982 up to now - except, as i said, "dog eat dog"). if you are still trying to introduce yourself through the divine music of joni mitchell, try anything you want from the 60s and 70s. really, anything. try to be open-minded and let her music flow through your veins. you have to be prepared, for it could be beautifully dangerous: once you know her, you will never let her go away from your soul	0
6301767799:tales_from_the_darkside_the_movie_is_a_great__tales_of_horror!!!!!!:sexylove_"sexylove"	Tales from the Darkside the movie is a well crafted horror film that brings us Stephen King and George Romeo and Michael McDowell together and give us different tales of imaginable horror!!!!!! Lot 243 is about a mummy that is on the loose and kills for revenge and Cat from Hell is a black cat that is out to kill a old rich guy and with Lover's Vow bring us to the city that never sleeps New York and one night a artist goes to meet a friend at a bar and ends up making a promise to a monster or he dies!!!!!!! Warparound a boy is trapped in a lady's house as she prepares him for dinner!!!!!!! Each tale is different and has its thrills and jolts within each story and has Debbie Harry from Blondie in it!!!!!!! If you loved the show then you need to check this one out!!!!	1
147433	Personally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen.  It was a pretentious, self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane.  I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.	0
B0002JBVGG:clean_and_refreshing:j._brady	A Clean and refreshing scent. Not heavy at all - its top notes are citrus based, and this is  appropriate for day or night wear. It is one of my favorites. It reminds me a little of Happy for Women, which I love, but don't wear, because of its distinctly feminine smell. Cudos to Clinique. Happy is a terrific man's cologne, it smells clean but not like laundry soap ( which too many men's colognes smell like these days )	1
B00000F3UB:unforgettable_(unfortunately):ray_cassavaugh	This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die	0
B000MXPE7Y:painfully_dull:david_g._apetz	You know the feeling...that feeling of "Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?"  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it	0
B000H6758C:great_watch:karen_e._victor_"rachel"	This watch is exactly what I was looking for. It is a small, pretty, functional watch that is quite durable.  It has plenty of features, but is not extremely complicated. The color is slightly lighter and more purpley then it is in the pictures	1

0790732068:this_is_education_at_its_best:l._n._cockerham_"professor_of_humanities"	So much is unknown about the valid attempts African-Americans made to build their own society's, during the 18th century, forward.  This story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in America as free, productive, people.'  My classes sat with eyes glued to the screen.  It was a horrific awakening for many of my students. They were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives, that African-Americans were a useless species.  Well, they now know the truth.  African-Americans were very diligent in building businesses, places of worship, homes, etc., which frightened the Cacausion people of that era, so they were destroyed - and much hope with them.	1
B0007ZCJ1G:excellent_set,_flimsy_hull:david_runyon	This set was one of the most fun builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set	1
459233	Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for	0

473981	This is a first person account of a trip to the arctic in the 1860's narrated by a Civil War deserter.  Within the first few pages, our hero enlists, pilfers letters off battlefield corpses, deserts, is injured in NYC draft riots, ends up in New Bedford, MA and signs up on a sailing ship without ryhme or reason or knowing where it was going.  The book was downhill from there.	0
B000E3C4MA:delish!_:)_:s._filizzi	This is *awesome* soup!! I was a little iffy about it (about any soup coming from a can or bag!) but ordered it anyway, it sounded so good. My hubby, toddler and I *love* it and could eat it every week if we had more money to buy it!  We took some on a camping trip and shared with all of our friends that we were with, and everyone agreed how great it was. Not as good as home-made, but really really good!  I'm not sure about the taste buds of the reviewer that gave it 1 star, but we all thought it was worth getting again..!	1
272726	Quick reader, poor design. It does a great job copying images to my Mac, but the flimsy lid is a piece of poo-poo. It stays on tight, which is good, until you try to open it. The force required to open it pulls the lid completely off making the ball-groove hinges useless. It's only a matter of time until the weak arms containing the hinges snap off, leaving the reader exposed to the elements	1

B00002MZ8D:not_for_wagons_with_only_two_slats!!!!:devon	I recently purchased this pad set for my #22 Radio Flyer Wagon, but had to send them back.  If you check the Radio Flyer web site, you'll notice that the #22 Wagon sides only have two wide slats.  When I received this pad set, I noticed the picture on the package shows a wagon with three narrow slats.  The loops to attach this set of pads are intended to be affixed to the center slats.  Since my wagon only has two slats, and they are wider, the loops were in the wrong spot and weren't big enough to fit around the slats on my wagon.  I'm only guessing, but I think these might be for an older model of wagon	0
B000FCA0K8:very_poor_handset_volume:tim	If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3.

The speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality.	0

This watch is for occasions only. you wear this one to weddings dance parties and or formal occassions. 1 you don't bring this to a fishing camp or use it climbing a rock face. 2 it's not a chonographic face so not for military so its not roughed enough to take out into the wilderness to go romping through with your M2A1 rifles. its sole perpuse is to get stares and look pretty on occasions like Birthday events. let your girlfriends buy it for you guys. I bought it because it was titanium mesh, not because of it's latching method. Again its almost 18th century... it's 21 century material used in place of a 18th Century design	1

Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead	0

0292725353:i_heard_it_on_the_'_x_':john_lease	This book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era, that of border radio.  Brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of Texas/Mexico and beamed their signal into all of North America - one angry resident complained that was ALL he could get on his radio.  These stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an 'X'. This spawned an industry of singers, politicians, preachers and pitchman the type we now see on &quot;infomercials&quot;.  Mail was the barometer of the day - the more mail you &quot;pulled&quot; in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations - &quot;keep those cards and letters coming!&quot;  New Federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from Wolfman Jack to the Rev. Ike - &quot;get out of the ghetto and get into the get-mo!&quot;  This is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio, salesmanship, and American sub-cultures and the bizarre	1
552215	I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.	0

64162	I subscribed to this publication expecting to read reviews of various fiction/non-fiction books - what it turns out to be is a series of editorials, premised around virtually all non-fiction.  All very high-brow and frankly, quite boring.  The one item worthwhile is the classifieds.  I think I'll ask to cancel my subscription and obtain a refund.  I anticipated something that would help me in finding great books to read but after 4 issues, I haven't seen anything of interest	0

B0000057MG:superb_starker:michael_b._richman	This collection of Italian Cello Sonatas by the great Janos Starker is one of the most delightful chamber albums I own.  The world renowned cellist was joined on this 1966 recording by pianist Stephen Swedish on five of the selections, and by his frequent collaborator Gyorgy Sebok on the Bach Sonata in G minor, which was recorded in 1963 and added to this collection to increase its length (it is a welcome addition musically too).  The selections here range from famous composers like Bach, Boccherini and Vivaldi, to the lesser known Corelli, Locatelli and Valentini.  For me, the common thread of this recording is the passionate performances of Starker.  Whether it is the happy bounce of the Vivaldi Allegro, the sublime rendering of the Boccherini Adagio, or the precise interplay with Sebok on the Bach Sonata, Starker plays masterfully and his cello is captured in rich, full sound by the Mercury Living Presence recording technique.  This is an excellent purchase for all cello enthusiasts	1

B000FH375I:look_at_all_the_pretty_bubbles...not.:macbook_pro_pro	Simply put, the keyboard sticky scuff cover never flattens out completely. There are always bubbles.  If you like playing with them all the time then this product is for you.  The keyboard soft material cover is not so bad, but holds onto the dirt and oils that would normally get on your screen and keyboard.  So, when you close the lid, the material then transfers some of that dirt right back.  My resolve...just wipe your keyboard and screen with a soft, clean, semi-wet towel every so often and the macbook pro will keep its luster	0

B000EIU67A:the_greatest!!!!!:kelly_a._tellez	I have had several digital cameras and this tops them all!!!!  Everything they say about it, is true.  I love not even having to think about batteries, I didn't believe what people said about the battery life, and I was just happy I didn't need to think about batteries, but I just got married and my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures with this camera and her pictures are almost as good as the photographer I hired and yes the camera battery lasted all day and thru the next 4 days on our honeymoon with another 200 pictures taken, no low battery light!!!!!  I even going to buy my parents one.  Also, one more note I love how fast you can take pictures, no wait 4 seconds between shots.  I had a Kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old and hated it, I hated the download procedure, it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive, but in it's own little cubbyhole and trying to attach them to your email was absolutely a nightmare, you'd have to identify the picture copy it to your desktop, remember what you called it and then attach it your email.  This is the main reason why I purchased this camera.  I will never own anything else, especially a Kodak.	1
B0001CUJU8:laser_pointer:m._atkinson	I'm certainly glad to have this pointer.  You'd never know it is inexpensive, since it looks quite sleek (like a fountain pen, though  heavier, for sure) and casts a sharp beam quite a distance.  Pleasantly sensitive to  the  touch, it needs no fussing.  You'd have to have pretty specialized needs to want a  more expensive model	1

B0009VC9ZE:opens_better_than_it_closes...:george_haber_"geo"	The Leek is a wonderful knife, but its sword-like point is subject to breakage. (Throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip--which is what happened to two of my Leeks!) Fortunately, Kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand-new ones, no questions asked. I just shipped them the knife, explaining what happened, and a week later got back a new knife.	1
B00094O3HI:great_product:n._gaudet	For the price this product is great - the bubbles were thick and rich and lasted a long time.  The scent was light and fragrant, not over-powering like some other products.  For those who love their bubble baths - highly recommended	1
B00008NG6N:terrible_piece_of_equipment:william_t._cole_jr._"wcole67"	After constant dropouts for the past 6 months and no help from the "Belkin Bozo's"(support). I received a long delayed canned e-mail answer to my problem which didn't help a bit. I finally got rid of this piece of junk and installed a Linksys Network Card. Both Linksys hardware and software are a vast improvement. No more dropouts.	0
B0006AAS5Q:great_watch_for_the_price.:s._kosloske	It's a great watch for the price.  I think I paid $130 for it. It runs great, keeps good time, and is probably one of the best watches you can get for the money.  High quality work, very close in look/feel/weight to a R*lex.  We'll have to see how the gold plating wears over time, but other than that, it's a great watch	1
B000B5XOW0:fabulous:s._stephens_"gospel_music_lover"	I have not gotten into watching the DVD as of yet because I am still watching the reruns on tv, but I know I have no qualms with the dvd. I have bought all the series thus far. It is a collection to have in your library if you are indeed a fan	1
B00005MKW7:sadly,_i_am_a_stew:thekeeth_"it_never_gets_weird_enough_for_me."	How many times have I seen this movie?  Somewhere between 25-50 viewings, with an additional "who knows how many" occurrences wherein I starting watching this movie with the explicit intent of falling asleep to it's indie soundtrack.	1
B00000J0B7:lots_of_fun:annonymos_"annonymos"	We stretched it across our pool but we have a stoper in the line so you fall in the pool. we just used some special clamps and a high compression spring. The kids love it because they can fly right into the pool	1
B000054P6C:nope:elnara_b._"minnesota"	I used this cream for three weeks, two times a day and it did make some part of my circles lighter- from brown it went to pink. But I skipped one day and it all went back. You pretty much have to be tied to it and keep using it two times a day	0
B000FJSA2G:wow_i_love_it.:sonny_mikel_murphy_"comic_geek"	Ok I gave it 4 stars just for the fact that you cant actually hold them in your hands and read them . I do have them on my laptop so I guess that kinda works. Whats great about it is the price. 30 bucks for 40 years of comics.....get real!!! I did have some install problems at first like others have but when I took the disc out and reloaded it it fixed itself. I think it was a Adobe update but it did it for me so no biggie. My only problem now is when am I going to find time to read all of the issues. Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics	1
B0007O97Y4:not_up_to_the_task--miserable_tech_support:r._charnock_"aardvaark"	We had this printer less than 6 months before the cartridge slider began to jam. We would get an error message, and then would have to reset the printer and reboot the computer to get it to work for a short while. We finally ended up sending back the printer on their exchange program, after I had to ask to speak to a supervisor. (The tech support wanted us to install a free ink cartridge when I had already installed several before contacting them) We have had the replacement printer less than two months and are already experiencing problems again. The ink cartridge is pooling ink under the cartridge rest area in a very heavy amount, and the cartridge slider again has begun to jam. Tech support has had us clean the plastic tape that pulls the cartridge carrier back and forth, and for now the unit is working. We still haven't addressed the excessive ink leak which probably has something to do with the jamming problem. I hope HP reviews comments on this website occasionally. I would like them to know I have believed in their printers and used them successfully for years, but my latest experience has caused me to reexamine that position. Also, HP tech support is very difficult to deal with at best. I talked to several overseas tech support reps that spoke almost unintelligible English. I am one consumer willing to pay a little more for a product that is well supported. HP are you listening	0

84838	This magazine comes with lots of advertisements - 70% or more. Plus, articles (less than 15 articles in every issue) in the magazines are not very useful.  I subscribed the magazine because it is inexpensive and it is rated high by other subscribers.  Now I realize I made a mistake.	0

B0000C4JZG:can_truly_taste_the_difference:keshlan_s._govinder	I bought this glass for my wife (who has a great interest and enjoyment of good wine) as a Christmas gift.  Last night, she tried out the glass with a friend.  The reviews from both of them were quite something to watch.  The wine from this glass tasted far, far superior to the same wine from an "ordinary" red wine glass.  In fact, they poured the remaining wine from the "ordinary" glass into this glass and shared the glass all evening.  There was really no doubt that this glass made the wine drinking experience a totally different, superior one	1
B000A33DYC:15_hours_of_charging_for_30_minutes_of_light...:tdpm	Small print on box: Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter, and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12V car adapter. The spotlight/lantern cannot be used while charging. A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power.	0
6301744128:up,_up_and_away...:bindy_sue_frnknschtein_"bigfootsalienbaby"	Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..	0

6303011063:the_best_of_both_worlds!:"peggysue3322"	I really enjoyed this movie. At first I thought that her two husbands were Vadinho the gambler and drunk, and Vadinho the loving husband.  He was bascially two different people himself.  I would have left him if I was her, though but I understand that in that time women didn't leave their husbands.  Also in that time, it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses.  After Vadinho's death, I was happy that Doa Flor decided to remarry, but I thought that she could've found someone more interesting than Teodoro. He's a nice guy and all, but he's just so boring.  She was used to the wildlife with Vadinho, and it was a shock to her when she married Teodoro.  I think that's why she gave into Vadinho when his soul returned.  And since she was the only one who could see him, there was no harm in having realtions with him once again, and in the future. She was happy with both of them. She was getting the best of both worlds.  I highly recommend this movie to all movie goers	1

B000B775DC:waste_of_my_money:mel	I bought this because the only way my 6 week old will sleep is in bed with me. I bought this to try to reduce the risk of SIDS since his has been sleeping in my bed. Unfortunately, he kept moving and it was causing his legs to go off of the side of the sleeper. Once his legs went off the side, his upper body would roll which would cause his face to be almost right against the side of the sleeper. Of course this concerned me so each time I woke up, I had to move him again. Finally, after a couple of time of doing this, I just took him out of it. This is the second sleep positioner I have bought and both have been worthless!!!	0
B000O2MDUO:great_hair_treatment:wanda_b._red	Expensive, but a small amount makes a big difference. Excellent conditioner for dry, thick hair. Also, very pleasing fragrance. The best hair treatment I've found for my straight, coarse, dry hair. Highly recommended	1
B000005K6I:social_distortion_at_their_best:taemin_jin	This album has new meaning to me now in 2007, where I go to a college next to a high school, where I see a bunch of "punk rockers" spending lots of money to make sure their hair is pretty and that their clothes are properly tattered to maximize trendiness.  There are plenty of punk rock bands out there that keep the spirit of Social Distortion alive, but sometimes their music is hard to find, and all the posers you see start to slowly extinguish that old punk rock fire.  Albums like this exist for times like those.  Just stick it in, turn up the volume, and rock out	1

B0000DYV87:haven't_run_into_a_pelican_case_that_was_anything_but_good:robert_cotton_"engineering_geek"	This case was ordered to hold some medical equipment that must travel with me on my about two-weeks-per-month business travel.  The good part is that this case will probably survive falling into a black hole.  The bad part is that it takes up half my carry-on suitcase.  But that's what you pay to have protection for expensive equipment	1
B00006II7C:i_love_cardio_blast!:"karamarie8604"	This is my favorite cardio video right now.  Because the video is only 30 minutes long, I can easily fit it into my day.

B000B7QMB8:this_puzzle_is_junk:j._cluff_"grandma"	I bought this for my 4 year old grandson for Christmas.  We opened it up and sat on the floor and began putting it together.  He was excited because he is a Lighting McQueen fan.  He got about four pieces of it together and got very frustrated.  It would not stay together.  THE PUZZLE IS JUNK!!!!!!!!  The pieces are not flat and do not interlock so that they stay together.  He lost interest and left.  I finished it enough so that they were laying together to see the picture - which is very cute.  But, no way would they ever all fit together.  Do not waste your money on this.  I also had to retape the corners of the box, as they were all coming apart too.  Yea for cheap imports.  The USA is so much better off for them???????	0
273284	I don't know what the complaints about this product are.  It seems that people are trying to use it for extreme hold hairstyles.  This is not the purpose of this product.  I use it for my short haircut to make the ends stay spiky and styled out, and it works WONDERFULLY.  No matter how much you move your head, it stays in place, but somehow moves enough to keep you from having a stiff look.  And, when you brush your hair out at the end of the day, it feels like you never put it in.  Hair stays soft and feels clean.  The reason why this gel is thinner is that it isn't as sticky or goopey in your hair as other gels.  And it spreads out easier	1
B000A3I32E:doesn't_do_the_job:t._falk	This shaver only works on short or fine hair. If your hair is long (more than 1/4 inch) or coarse, it just skips over the hair and doesn't do anything. I've thrown it away and gone back to disposable razors	0

312796	I bought this adaptor because my kids and I have both the Nintendo DS and DS Lite. It works great on the original DS, but the thing that's supposed to fit into the DS Lite is too wide.

B00014K5BO:disappointed:k._rasberry	I bought the DVD hoping to see one skit -- the funniest one my family had ever seen on SNL. We had it recorded on VHS many MANY years ago and somehow lost it. But we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where Phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits -- "Smiling Laughing Joking Around Man" ... "Man Who Reminds Me Of My Doggie" ... "Hair Head!"  I thought for SURE that THE funniest skit in all of SNL history would be on there, but no...it was just a 20 second clip. I was SO disappointed!!	0
B0000041RF:why?:giordano_bruno	There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers.	0

6301016858:long_tall_dexter:bomojaz	Dexter Gordon is Dale Turner, an ex-patriot jazz musician living in Paris and playing nightly at the Blue Note. (His character is based loosely on Lester Young and Bud Powell, but mainly it is all Dexter.) A young Frenchman (Francois Cluzet) idolizes him and later befriends him. Dex has problems, mainly booze, and between blowing gigs seems most concerned about how to get something to drink. The cliche of the self-tortured jazz musician who's got to find something new to say on his horn every night is, of course, the main focus of the film. (That this is the ONLY way to greatness for a jazzman is the great myth for the artform. But it sells.) Dex gets homesick for New York, returns, falls into his old habits, misses the flight back to Paris, and soon dies. The movie is overly long, but Gordon is mesmerizing. Dexter speaks slowly, as if from behind a veil (Gordon was ill at the time and living in obscurity in Mexico when he agreed to do the movie); he had much input on the film, creating his own dialogue and insuring accuracy. The picture has faults, to be sure, but it's a mighty achievement nonetheless. The music, of which there is plenty, is, of course, top-notch	1
B0006I8I3C:very_functional,_and_lots_of_comments.:bill_r	I saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal.

121729	Leave it to me to start into a series in its' second, third, or fourth installments. In this case, it's the fourth. Course, there's a good explanation why. I set out looking for Final Fantasy I&II: Dawn of Souls for my Gameboy Advance(Hey, if you're going to collect a series, it's a good thing to start at the beginning) at my local videogame store but they only had Final Fantasy IV Advance so I decided to get it instead. There isn't much that I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers here about Final Fantasy IV Advance.The story goes like this..The kingdom of Baron is on a quest to collect all the elemental crystals. The commander of its air force, Cecil, has been dismissed after questioning the king's motives. With the help of others; Cecil sets out to stop the growing threat and, in the meantime, uncovers a far more dangerous one. It's a deep story with alot of twists and turns & is a deeply challenging game due to the Active Time Battle system. I can't recommend this game enough. It's one of my all-time favorite Final Fantasy games.	1
51134	Thoroughly enjoyed the CD.  Have some of the songs as performed by other artists, but it's nice to hear them as performed by the writer.  I'm always impressed by one with that kind of creativity.	1
B0008GNWXI:not_the_best:m._r._adams	Product description describes a tub of 108. The actual item is only 36 pieces. Not very happy about only getting 36 when the description stated otherwise. Additionally, the packing was covered in a layer of dirt so thick I couls not read the label	0
B00004NKD2:fahrenheit_451:general_breadbasket	I think it's kind of poetic that I ended up getting the film adaption of Ray Bradbury's "Fahrenheit 451". It was because I couldn't find the book anywhere! I don't know how good it is as an adaption, but I found the film thought provoking, well directed and clever.	1
325773	This movie is laughable today. It's very dated, and it shows. It's not worth your time. The acting is so-so, but felt forced (like William Shatner style). The storyline is okay. By today's standards, it appears like a low budget flick	0
B0009JKI9K:please,_buy_these_blades!:dimasin	I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!	0

B000ALBLIE:competent_scrub_for_oily_skin,_but_the_menthol_is_noxious.:mirasreviews	Clinique's Exfoliating Scrub is a facial scrub for oily skin. It is a thick, white paste packed with medium-size scrubbing grains -more grains than in Clinique's "7 Day Scrub" for normal skin. To use, massage onto clean, wet skin in a circular motion. Rinse with warm water. Careful not to get it in your eyes, as I did once while rinsing it off in the shower. This scrub does an adequate job of exfoliating and retexturizing skin. But it's unsuitable for sensitive skin, and it stinks to high heaven. It contains menthol, which burns skin and clears the sinuses at no extra charge. Having so much menthol so close to my nose is not a good thing. Of course, it is "100% Fragrance Free" according to Clinique, meaning that the smell of menthol is unadulterated by perfumes. The scrub also contains salicylic acid, so beware that this might be too drying for some skin types, especially if used frequently. The performance isn't bad. The olfactory aesthetics are atrocious. This is the harshest, most caustic facial scrub I've ever used. Sensitive complexions beware	0
526407	Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone.

552450	I first encountered this gem of a book when I decided to home educate my children for a few years, and it came with my daughter's fourth grade Calvert School kit.  Yes, it is European ethnocentric and there are the references to god, but our family was and remains enlightened enough and able to explain *context* even to children.	1
B000FQJOZQ:a_relentless_tech_mix_that_starts_off_with_a_bang.:doctor_trance	This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.	1
B0006GBD0O:best_buy_ever:p.smith	We bought this bike for our bike mad son when he was 1! My hubby had to take the seat off so that he could totter around on it. By the time he was 2 he was literally racing around on it, gathering up speed and then picking his feet up and cruising along for ages. Needless to say he was cycling on a proper bike shortly before his 3rd Birthday.(He just got on the bike for the first time and cycled off) His sister is now  nearly 2 and is already following ing his footsteps. Dont just think about it , buy it. And the sooner the better. Other friends have bulkier versions but the kids cant handle them like this one. And forget the versions with brakes, the kids should only go as fast as they can handle	1
B000F930FS:highly_recommend_this_item!:d._sorenson	This is my first "electric" litter box.  I have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up.  It really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box.  It was a breeze to set up.  I also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor. And with the tent they can't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a BM on the floor.  I'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down	1
B000FYZ9T8:good,_but_specifically_for_700w!:robert_lewis_"silverleaf"	Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow	1

427510	At one time, Southern Living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas.  Over the past few years, it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food, in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook.  Only the Christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now.  We cannot speak to its information on gardening, just the cooking part.  If it were not my mother's habit of reading Southern Living, we would have cancelled this long ago.  If you are a serious cook, get the cookbooks from years ago.  The current magazine is well beneath you	0
492944	This camera is amazing. Out of the 3 digital camera's under $150 I've used, this is by far the best, beating out the Kodak and the SiPix. I originally bought the SiPix, and it was junk. Don't buy the SiPix that's under $150. The Kodak for some reason didn't seem like it took as good pictures as the FinePix, but the software was a little better, being from Kodak.	1

45275	I've been a P&W subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. I've also tried various other writers' magazines, such as The Writer and Writer's Digest. The latter two were fine when I was just beginning to dip into the freelance market, just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts, but when I gained more experience, I soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. The articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that I was no longer gaining new insights. P&W was the next step up.	1

B00005Q7DY:adventures_for_adults_and_family:mr._johnny_garcia_jr._"johnny_garcia"	I especially love this magazine because it gives details of different "non tourist" adventurous things to do.

I recommend it for anyone who likes the outdoors and likes to live on the edge, and with this magazine you will know what most adventure-ers dont	1

B0000B35GL:great_earrings:jo_kirk_"jojo"	I'm very pleased with these earrings. They are a good weight...they aren't so heavy that they drag at the ear, but they are substantial and a perfect size. I'd recommend these to earring lovers	1
B000EDGBA6:not_tasty:shopaholic	I thought this would be a great-tasting, healthy snack after reading the reviews. Mine arrived safely and crunchy, unlike the other reviewer who got a bad batch. However, they were not sweet and tasty. My sister described it as tasting like cardboard. Now I have 5 whole bags I don't know what to do with. Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy	0
B0006ZSUEW:junk:k._dixon	I purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework, and reading all the reviews I could on the different kinds.

B000BPQUV2:atomic_clocks_are_the_only_way_to_go:s._a._gould_"amasu"	So it's not a big deal to reset your clocks when the time changes and when the power goes out, right? Well... yes it is. As I get older and technology becomes more demanding and time consuming, the fact that I can have ONE DEVICE that takes care of itself has become fairly important to me. It's just a clock, but... it works. Which is more than I can say for my fax or copier or phone or... I always get LaCross because I like the looks of their stuff. Be good to yourself- upgrade to Atomic	1
B00006347J:ouch!_stay_away_from_this_one!:rubyredhead	I bought this a few months ago, and after about three or four shaves it stopped working properly. It yanks on the hairs instead of cutting them, which is very painful! It doesn't pull them all the way out, which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue.  Sometimes it works okay, but what good is a razor that only works half the time? Others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it's losing power. Mine does sound "slower" when it's yanking the hair, but that doesn't seem to be related to battery charge (e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode, and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in!) Even when not pulling hair, the shave is not close. Definitely find a different razor	0
B000LJB9TG:horror,_mystery_and_a_good_doses_of_weird_eroticism!:hiram_gomez_pardo	This film must be scrutinized in the light of being Tony Scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment. Additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision. Sarandon and Deneuve are in very good shape and Bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances; after his standout performance in "The man who fell to earth" and "Furyo."	1
B000ANWVBI:poor_quality.__save_your_money!!!!!_:janet_c._taylor	I wish I had read some of the reviews for this product before I bought it.  I was SO disappointed with the quality of the product. The sheets are extremely rough, thin and scratchy. The comforter required restitching because the original stitching looked more like a basting stitch and came apart as easily as one. Since Thomas the Tank Engine is such a popular character, I would have thought more effort would have been put into the integrity and quality of products bearing  it's trademark. As such, I am very reluctant to purchase anymore character bedding	0
105253	I have gone through my latest copy twice of this magazine. The interesting articles and letters make you feel like you are part of a community, not just a crazy cat person. I like the extensive breeder listing in the back, whether or not I ever will get a pure bred cat.	1

205637	Unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents/teachers, this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do, that don't take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials, and that are very attractive when finished. I also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it -- very important when it comes to encouraging creativity.	1

B00009XV7T:don't_buy:r._forsman_"chronic"	These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair.	0
422763	I am not impressed with Tiffen filters I got in this set.  The finish of the rings are poor.  Despite of previously poor reputaion, I recently purchased some 67mm Quantaray filter from the local Ritz Camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of Tiffen filters.  I never got Tiffens before, had good experience with Hoyas.  I will probably stay with those from now on.  Now come to think of it, Ritz camera indicated the Quantaray they had were made by Hoya.	0

B0007XTN5S:great_for_bigger_babies:trousseau4_"mom_of_4"	For all the reviews that have written that this product has been recalled, that is incorrect. It was the original Hip Hammock and all those that were in the stores were removed from the shelves. So unless you have an older model that was bought before 2/2005, you should have nothing to worry about. This product is great when your baby outgrowns the front carriers like the Baby Bjorn. I have had no problems with it and it is easier than using a sling with older babies.	1
B00085EWOW:not_what_i_ordered:y._biller	Like many of the other reviews (that I read after receiving the doll), I got a hispanic doll with red hair... whoever heard of that!  My daughter is adopted from Guatemala and has black, straight hair.... This doll depicted how I style her hair and would have been a perfect match, as it also had black hair.... after waiting for a week, I received the doll, expecting it to look like the one pictured, and it wasn't.... I am highly, highly disappointed, and have emailed all of my contacts telling them about this and giving them the sight to view all the unhappy comments on this as well as pass along to their contacts..... I will never make this mistake again....  as the saying goes.... "Fool me once, shame on YOU...fool me twice, shame on ME.... well, shame on them!!!	0
B0002TRTNK:decent_sock_but_not_quite_stretchy_enough_through_ankle_area:susanna_youch	Nice sock, but the leg area was not really ample or stretchy enough, in my opinion, to be considered plus size.   I will probably pass these on to my sons, who wear 8 men's size.	1

0375404473:want_to_learn_about_negotiation_with_sports_world_examples?:matt_williams	For a recently college graduate and moderate sports world observer with little experience negotiating in a business environment, this book was a pleasure to read. The concepts in this book are on or above par with my textbook on negotiation. However, I specifically enjoyed how Steinberg illustrates important concepts with stories involving the ever interesting personalities of professional sports. From establishing values to finalizing the contract, this book is efficiently organized to lead through the negotiation process. Also, at the end of each sub-chapter is a summary of the key points of the reading. Winning with integrity isn't easy in general, let alone in the ruthless world of sports agents. Leigh shares his experiences that have lead to his success in this fun and insightful book	1
B0002EPHN4:great,_but_don't_expect_it_to_last_long:paul_n._edwards	I've owned two of these now. The screen's great and I love the wireless headphones -- terrific for very small children. Our 2-year-old drove to New Mexico and back (well, we drove and he watched videos) with this thing.	0
39076	The main appeal of the Grand Theft Auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit. San Andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you. This time the action takes place in California inspired locales such as Los Santos, San Fierro and the Las Vegas inspired Las Venturas, all within the enormous state of San Andreas. The main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early 90's. This provides a great opportunity for Rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer. New to Grand Theft Auto is the concept of territory control, as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in Los Santos later on in the game. Perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character's appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game. These may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly. The character's skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series. The customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early `90s in California. The lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits, expensive jewelry and trendy fashions. Your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos, his physical fitness can also be changed.	1

Now I have to scramble to get a replacement before I take off.	0
B00000J1E2:very_disappointed:joan_cone	The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work.  We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title.  We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works.  Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all.  I would not buy it.  the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!!	0
B000AR7S30:great_watch_for_the_price:donald	I came across this watch on a Friday sale at well over half off, a great price.

I figured setting the watch couldn't be too difficult, there are only two buttons, so I purchased it with a gift card, totally painless.	1

B00065Z054:truly_disappointed:a._doyle_"smiley_ali"	I was really excited to try this cage out for my 6 lb male maltese.  It is a perfect size and it seemed really well made.  My dog doesn't really like cages and was able to chew right through the zipper seam.  He is NOT aggressive and does not chew things he shouldn't, so to my surprise about a week after my husband and I bought the cage, we found him out of it.  We were truly disappointed.  It is a cute cage and has a very sturdy frame.  If you are not planning on zippering the cage or your dog does not chew through zippered seams, it is a great cage.....but overall, i was disappointe	0

298600	Goth meets Cabaret, or rather Gothic music influenced by Cabaret. Thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by Projekt. The eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the "dark cabaret" scene, and do so quite well. The first song, Coin-Operated Boy by the Dresden Dolls, is a great start, and the CD continues onward to devious Evil Night Together by Jill Tracy (which sets up a wonderful film noir mood) and on to the darker, electronic dance number Cabaret Fortune Teller by Audra, to a remix of Knock Three Times on My Coffin by Projekt veterans Black Tape for a Blue Girl. Along the way numerous other bands are covered.	1

First it worked GREAT, then about half a bottle down it stopped working.  Had to take more and more.  Went back to GNC.  Told me that anything like this will work when you first start and you have to start switching it up or taking more and more, and more, and more.  Told me I should switch product every one to two months.  Just wanted to recommend that you don't stock up on just one.  It will work for a while but plan on changing once you don't feel the effects anymore	1
0805208984:eye_opening:m._j._keel	As a former history major and teacher I am very familiar with the history of the Crusades from the Western point of view.  They have been portrayed in literature, movies, and history.  They have been glamorized and vilified by Westerners for centuries.  Reading Amin Maalouf's rendering of this familiar story from the view-point of Arab chroniclers was like looking through Alice's looking glass at a world that is backwards from the one we know.  Here we don't have just Crusaders, advernturers, or even the evil conquerors that deconstructionists portray, but invaders, barbarians, and enemies of God Himself.	1

0520247639:disappointing:a_reader	Overall, I found this book disappointing.  In its defense, its basic thesis of the movement of Jewish American Orthodoxy towards the `right' (more closed and intensely religious) is interesting, and I am sure accurate, and Heilman's analysis of its evolution is insightful and well-researched.  However, I was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray Hareidi society through the prism of its own value system, or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all. Heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader, and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations. Examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture.  Hareidi society has its own worldview which, although too complex to elaborate on here, has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values, reasons which Heilman completely disparages or ignores.  (For an example of a book that is not written by a religious author, yet is able to appreciate Hareidim from their own perspective try "Real Jews" by Noah Efron).  In general, I found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct (i.e. a defensive reaction to the Holocaust) to be grossly insensitive to the Hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition.	0

I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year.

B000HE39MK:won't_co-exist_with_other_programs:dave_"dave"	Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.	0

I realized when it called the tractor a negative name, stupid I believe it was, that it was going back.  I wouldn't want my child having a toy that calls others names, so I wont give it to anyone either.  Not to mention, the grammar used, is not correct.

B0006ZN538:great_deal,_good_flavor,_but_beware_celiacs!:tonya_lee	I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday. I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it. However, I cannot tolerate gluten or rice and after eating some of what I had baked, I had an allergic reaction. I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills nor if there could be any cross-contamination. The lady on the phone seemed to think that the mills are shared equipment and that no precautions are taken to avoid cross-contamination. If you're buying it for low-carb prep only, it should be a good flour at a great deal. Please beware if you are using it to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains	0

B000EAT232:cuby_gets_dirty:michael_butts	The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film	0
B000BDDHPQ:great_flavor,_awesome_juice!:sarahyogagal_"sarah"	This is my favorite of essn's juices. It is unique and has a beautiful color, which you see when using it as a mixer in cocktails. Also, a HUGE hit with kids. Can't beat 100% juice. Worth every penny	1
B00005B0BM:nice.:robert_makela	I have owned one for the past 4 years (haven't turned it off since the day I bought it) and it's still projecting strong as ever.  I bought one for my friend for Christmas also and he loves it just as much as I do	1

1579125743:_am_i_missing_something?:muggle_"leah"	This book doesn't even deserve a star. I just fell upon it, on a bookshelf with loads of old books in my house. I'm nearly 17 years old, and perhaps this book is the kind that you appreciate as you get older, but honestly, I don't see myself enjoying this book even in 20 years... I've read so many reviews raving about how 'poetic, sensual, wonderful' it is and what a talent the person is...sorry I don't see it!	0
B000K6IEHA:worst_quality:c._curless	After remodelling our kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out. When I saw the picture of the towel holder, I thought it unique with its scroll-work and wouldn't look like everything else I saw. When I received it, the first thing I noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible. I tried with no luck to remove the stains. The area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt! All in all, I would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	0
1933771208:awesome_book:s._glick_"glick97"	We went to a book siging to get this book. Truthfully, I wasn't sure if the book was going to live up to the hype. T.O. graciously signed books and all proceeds went to charity. I was surprised this book was so well written. My four year old wants me to read it over and over again. He doesn't like for me to read to him but he loves this book! It is the perfect book for children. Its not too short but not too long. I have read this book at least 10 times in the past 3 days. I would recommend this book to anyone with small children. It is great book for little boys because of the football theme. However, the lesson is something everyone can appreciate. Great Book	0
B000IQ9JQM:cute,_elegant!:rebecca_a._washburn_"pandora"	I love these!  They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box.

113563	Leeches is a terrible movie.  Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director's other film Speed Demon).  When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign.  The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director's work.	0
B000N5DJF0:great_quality:c._williams	There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.	1
B000BUUVTE:unimpressed_with_this_product:anthony_harika_"hareek"	I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion	0

B000GWPTLC:works,_but..._ech:e._ridley_"eagle_eye"	This unit replaced my old AIO 7410, which I LOVED. This one just feels cheap. The construction is cheap, parts are loose, and it feels like a child's toy, not an office tool. Given the choice, I would not buy another one	0
B000A2T3EM:not_so_great:d._majumdar_"scientist_shopahollic"	I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.	0

534590	I bought the Shampoo Theory and Condition Theory and this Redo Freshen-Up Mist. I have normal-type hair that needs to be washed every other day -- and if I use a lot of product, it needs to be washed every day. I have very sensitive skin too. This mist worked very well on my hair, definitely freshened it up and allowed me to restyle it with a quick blow dry. And it feels awesome on my skin. Well done, Jonathan	1
436886	This foam product by Jonathan is okay.  The reviews on his products are highly overrated.  The price doesn't bother me at all.  There are better foams for thin and limp hair	0
319145	Used along with Shampoo Theory, my hair turned out worse than it ever had.  Not recommended, at least for medium/wavy hair.  No frizz control	0
262977	The game when you first buy it is awsome. i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters, make people fly 20 yards with your finger, and bunt-kick a police car down 5 blocks? the game lasts a bit because of the "smash smash get some cash" gameplay (the more smash points you get, the more moves you get). the moves are the best part. at one point in the game, you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss. i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street... its alot better then skateboarding on a  bus if you ask me. anyway, once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers, it gets extremely repetitive.	1

It has such a unique and diverse pictorial on each page by 'grand' and 'credible' photographers.  For anyone who takes pictures...likes pictures...this BOOK is a MUST GET for you.  I have it on my coffee table and I get rave comments on it all of the time about what a GREAT book it is	1
B0002E2KOI:7_months_and_still_works_great.:k._leiter	I know most people would look at this and think for the price it can't be that great.  But it does everything a capo should do and well.

B00000ICZA:letdown_by_hallmark:newton_ooi	Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies from children's books, and this probably one of the worst.  Based on both "Alice in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking Glass" this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg.  The lead character of Alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good.  The movie revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression.  Even the crying scenes seemed fake.  Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her?  The cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  The only bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character.  All in all, quite boring	0
B000H6R03M:best_coffee_ever:toby_deroche	The variety blend coffee pods are simply the best coffee I've had in a long time. I drink up to three cups of coffee a day, but the one I look forward to the most is the cup I make in the morning on my Senseo machine. The origins pods are the best of the best. These pods have a rich, full bodied flavor that surpasses the other medium and dark roast pods that are available. Get the variety pack and try them all. They are all wonderful	1

B0000899M2:easy_learning:focus22	I am enjoying the Talk Now! Learn Bulgarian CD. Great images, repetitive visual and auditory instruction make learning the basic words, numbers, time, etc. easy. Also, the games add interest. You can print out each section with photos and words in Bulgarian. However, I would have liked to see the program come with the Cyrillic alphabet and pronunciation guide.	1
B000BTHJCM:not_happy:m._tillson	I ordered this product on June 7th 2006, today is July 11th 2006, and I still have not received it.  I have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it, than to wait over a month for it to show up.  I'm really not happy with the turn around time for the Tide HE Detergent.	0
535668	This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available. But today with  doom and half life versions for xbox, there is actually something to compare halo to, and it doesn't stand up.	1
B000BOQWJ8:they've_changed...:b._kemp	I bought these to replace an identical pair that I've been wearing for ten years. I got the old ones in London, and they were made in England. This new pair was made in China.  They have changed...some for the good and some for the bad.  There is now more toe room, which I like. However, both heel pads were ill fitted and loose. I had to trim them and stick them back in with super glue. I'm starting to really break them in now and I think I'll love them for years to come. They provide good ankle support and keep my feet warm. Buyer beware that these boots come very very stiff, and will take time to break in.  When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit. If you try to wear them too long when you first get them, they will most definitely wear blisters on your feet. Break them in slowly and you'll have a wonderfully comfortable pair of boots to last a long time.	1
B000GXK8KS:absolute_rubbish:joanna_loffler	Wish I could give this a negative.  When I did finally get a sticker out, it wouldn't stay stuck to anything for more than five minutes.  Ended up sending it back to the wholesaler as unworkable and overpriced	0

6303950000:flesh_gordon:p._connelly_"patman"	I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an "R" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today	0
1850895511:a_250_page_cv_on_how_clive_james_became_an_intellectual:mtrew@primenetzw.com_"mukiwa"	Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out.	0
B000J4U0CK:great_doll_for_toddlers:inkedmama	This is my daughters first "real" baby doll. She is almost 2, and I have never seen her love another toy like this one. She loves to give the baby kisses and feed her with the bottle it comes with, and I bought an extra outfit so she can change the baby for bed. This doll is really pretty compared to other baby dolls I have seen lately. The skin is a very soft, nice feeling plastic with a cloth torso, and smells like sweet baby powder! I was pleased when I was able to wipe off dirt that was on the dolls hand really easily. I love all the accessories that you can get for the Little Mommy dolls too. I highly recommend this one	1

B0006HB9KW:incredibly_frustrating_toy:h._koehler	This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately	0

These are still the same great jeans, reliable fit and quality that you know.  Currently I have three of these in my closet nest to standard 505's, and they are virtually identical, but the signiture series cost a lot less. Same thick denim material, unlike a lot of fancy boutique jeans, that last a long time, and can stand up to most activities that an active person does.  Check these out, you won't be dissapointed, and neither will your wallet	1

530377	I subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in PDF form. I was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. Frankly I was disappointed. The reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis, (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). Reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... Please. They are also fairly out of date. Most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. Some titles aren't available anywhere that I can figure. Whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find?	0
B0001WGGL4:great_starter_set!:carolyn_"shopperextrodinaire"	If you're not sure if your little one will really be "into" these train sets, this one is a great one to try out.  It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings, but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set.  We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains.  However, after he received it, he found out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either!  I just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train.  However, you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes Brio trains now, and the train separately as well.  This train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use Duracell.  Energizer only makes it two days in this train but Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks.  Other than that, highly recommend this toy	1
518560	This is the worst item you can get for your 360. I got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360. It was crashing and freezing and ultimately I had to get my console repaired. Do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby (360)	0

B00078NJYE:don't_count_on_this_charger_when_you_need_it!:ditblanch_"ditblanch"	My husband purchased this charger for me for Christmas, after lots of mornings when my van wouldn't start and he was already gone to work.  Except for having to search far and wide for the right kind of extention cord to plug this thing in, we were excited to have something for those "just in case" moments.  We plugged it in and have left it in since then.  Just this week our battery was dead again.  We excitedly went to use this charger, and lo and behold, it wouldn't work.  We had to call a neighbor to come and give us a jump start.  Later that day the battery was dead again (!!!) and this charger worked that time, so who knows what happened?	0
B000EMU1K8:is_that_a_lie?:unhappy_guitarist	Cakewalk"s advertisement saying something like..." no experience needed to operate this software..." is, in my mind, mis-leading at least and a down right lie at most.

339982	Reason once had two things going for it. It articulated principled libertarianism, and it was a consistently interesting magazine. Now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. It is also dull and aimless, often badly written. Case in point: the current issue as I write includes a defense of the FDA by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians, and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements, as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. The "old" Reason would never have published such a piece.  Nor would Reason have previously published Ronald Bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. Bailey also supports the Iraq war and psychiatric coercion. A bright spot continues to be the writing of Jacob Sullum	0

81706	I had great expectations of this book but the more I read the worse it got. For a person who is supposed to be an 'Orientalist' he sure does hate his subject. Under cover of being a scholar Lewis promotes his neoconservative ideology as serious learning. This ideology is the guiding force behind the troubles in the Middle East today. Powerful people listen to Lewis and follow his advise on how to deal with the Muslim world. Unfortunately this advice comes from a person who has made it a lifelong mission to destroy and defame the very subject he claims to be an expert of	0

452473	As long as artists keep making albums with only one good song, people will keep getting them for free in internet.  Nestor keeps insisting in doing instrumental hip hop, pop, commercial, elevator music.  If you like that kind of music, buy this CD, otherwise buy Hubert Laws, or Dave Valentin among others.  If you want to listen to good Nestor music, buy "Morning Ride", "Dance Of The Phoenix", "Talk To Me", "Mi Alma Latina" or the charanga album " Mis Canciones Primeras".  Sorry Nestor, I am a big fan of your music but you are wasting your talent doing this kind of stuff.  When do you plan to make a good non commercial latin jazz album	0

BUT, he really likes this game, he "gets" the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters.  It has a tad more "killing" of stuff than I care for but what doesn't these days. He likes being able to be different characters, his favorite is Puss n Boots!	1

B000HAB4RQ:resuscitating_a_classic_movie_with_a_lacking,_lethargic_sequel_three_decades_later:ed_uyeshima	There are moments in this inconsequential 2005 comedy when I can see a bright future for Jennifer Aniston's light comedic talents, even though this movie does not stretch her much beyond her likeably insecure "Friends" persona. She plays Sarah Huttinger, a likeably insecure New York Times obituary writer going home to Pasadena to attend her younger sister Annie's wedding. Sarah is picture-pretty, 33 and engaged to a nice, unflappable guy named Jeff who accompanies her. At the same time, she's unhappy about her career and wondering why she always feels out-of-sorts with her well-to-do family. A ray of light comes from her only kindred spirit in the family, her feisty, tart-tongued grandmother Katherine, who tells Sarah about her late mother's pre-wedding tryst in Mexico that gives rise to questions about Sarah's paternity.	0

6301015320:history_by_a_great_story_teller:alastair_n._mcleod	This is far too big and rich a film to be contained in any summary description. It is rich in its beautiful depictions of childhood, family, and of sexual love, rich in its narrative of the growth of fascism, and fascist personalities, in pre-WW II Italy, rich in its analysis of the unjust relationship between the owners and the workers of Italy's farm lands, rich in the beauty of its sets, costumes, and scenes. It is a rough, rambling, long film, badly dubbed in the English version, but it is also an indispensable, inimitable, and immensely enjoyable journey through a vital part of modern European history. I saw the "short" version of the film shortly after its release in 1977--it did not have a long run in the United States--and never forgot it. I saw it again, just now, thirty years later, but this time, the director's much longer cut. It had lost none of its power.	1

152196	This dvd brings me back to when I was growing up in the 70's. I am happy to share this with my kids.  Who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or Rosie Greer singing "It's Alright to Cry."  One of the highlights is the duet by Roberta Flack and a young Michael Jackson singing "You Don't Have to Change at All."  I am so happy I am able to have this piece of my childhood to share.	1
B0002E3FCO:works_well:d._kubli	The pop filter is of decent quality. The stand is not as flexible as I might have hoped, so it makes it hard to use it with the desktop Blue Snowball microphone that I have, but that's remedied by attaching it to the desk itself	1
240876	One of the funniest magazines around.  In a recent article, the Weekly Standard proposed massively expanding the IRS to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit.  Which group did the "Weekly Standard" say should be targeted for this increased IRS presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? The Entertainment Industry.  The reality tv show contestants, the teen-pop singers and the like.  The article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry, but with all the people that really want fame, that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame, the industry would continue along (I'm curious if O'Rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers).  Another O'Rourke article provided the readers with an alternate Inaugural Address by Bush (subtitle: "What if George W. Bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . ."; quote: "The media say that I won the election on the strength of moral values.  If the other fellow had become president, would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?").	1
B0006H5WIC:great_quality_-_perfect_match!:avelaine_"kids_&_big_dogs"	I like the fact that Kidsline offers extra crib sheets to go with the Zanzibar theme and am impressed with the quality of these sheets (I have two, one came with the bedding set and one was purchased off my baby registry) . They wash extremely well (still looks new), are soft and fit the mattress appropriately. However, I think $16.99 for a crib sheet is a bit pricey and have purchased other crib sheets that match the theme and are just as nice. (Amy coe, sage green at Target for $8.99 and koala baby sage green for $9.99 at BRU).  Since you need several crib sheets, I just don't feel the price is worth it for this one.	1
461307	King's Quest games are classic, but why are they not including King's Quest 8: Mask of Eternity?  I know that it was not well received when it came out (I personally liked it).

Important Note:  The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case.  Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be.  After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code.  It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case.  You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner.	1

B000HCZ8EO:avoid_at_all_costs:pattipeg_s._harjo_"spanish_teacher"	As a teacher I use Word, PowerPoint, and Publisher when working with students AND engaging in professional activities (presentations to organizations, etc.)  I have been using Office 2002, and thought I should upgrade.  BIG mistake.  The ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through, especially since I previously just customized the toolbar so everything I needed was immediately available.  I'm still trying to figure out how to type in Chinese, although the Spanish and German are working fine.  Additionally, they've come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons/icons/etc.  As a previous commenter noted, making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems, and I also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber.  It took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual, and I ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar.	0

B000C1OIJQ:great_machine_when_it_works:bilgerunner	My girlfriend and I recently bought two ultrasonic humidfiers -- this machine and an Air-O-Swiss 7135.  The Venta worked well when it worked.  However, it frequently stopped working for no apparent reason.  You could jiggle the thing, and it would go on and off.  We finally figured out that there was a defect in the little plunger on the bottom of the tank that controls the flow of water into the base.  The water wasn't flowing properly, and the machine stopped (as it should) because there was no water.  Took it back to the hardware store where we bought it, and the guy there said that lots of other people have had the same problem.  It may be number 1 in Germany, but it gets only 1 star here	0
0440228239:funny_&_interesting_-_great_series!!:john_morris_"gt_dad_of_5"	This is the first of a great series of books. Knights & squires, quests & fairies, action & discovery ---- old stories re-told in an easy-to-read style with a dose of dry humor. Geared towards older children (my daughter LOVES them all), they don't insult the intelligence of the reader (I enjoyed them more than much of the "grown-up" fiction I read). The series is best when you read them in order, as you meet the characters again in future books. The books were such a hit, I actully purchased them in hardback (gasp!) so that the rest of my kids can read & re-read them as they get older. We're eagerly waiting for the 7th book (and the 8th...) to come out in print!	1

590925	There are just some trilogy's that should not be made - and the Wild Things trilogy is one of them. This is not really a trilogy per se, since each of the films carries with it the same story, with the same twists. If you have seen the first, you have basically seen each of the sequels... except the sequels are both much worse. Take out the big name actors and make a direct-to-DVD release... and you have Wild Things: Diamonds In The Rough.	0
B0007ODN3K:hard_to_put_in_place:k._martin	The spice rack looks nice.  Won't know the quality until I can use it and see how much weight it will take.  I had a horrible time getting in under the cabinet.  It is definitely a 2-person job and there was only me.  The self-adhesive tabs didn't work at all even to just put the spice rack up to use the screws.  Very awkward to use the screws.  Doesn't allow for any room especially the back screws.  I did the wrong thing by taking the extending arm hardware off to get the spice rack in place and to make it easier to screw it under the cupboard and that is where it sits.  Now to get the hardware back onto the extender arms is almost impossible.  I wouldn't have purchased this knowing how hard it is to attach to the underneath of the cabinet.  Took much too much time to get it into place	0
564823	I've seen and heard Sheryl live when she's not surrounded by rock and roll dinosaurs.  She's great - she's hip, self-assured and kicks butt!  But here, she tells the audience in "Leaving Las Vegas":  "I'm playing Central Park tonight... but I have some friends coming up so can you be patient...Please? For lil' ol' me? Be very patient...." almost begging the audience not to walk out while she's singing solo.  It's almost as if she knows that the audience will have to suffer her solo attempts until the "friends" arrive.  The irony is that Sheryl solo is the best part of the album.   With the others on board, we can't see what Sheryl can do, and those familiar with her know that Sheryl is capable of a lot.   She's overwhelmed by Keith Richard, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Chrissie Hynde and by including so many rock gods she herself is diminished in importance and stature.  Her songs "It Don't Hurt" and "There Goes the Neighborhood" stand out on the album showing that Sheryl can rock harder and better than any of her "friends." Too bad she didn't include "Am I Getting Through" -- the Part 2 of that was a great rock moment.  Natalie Maines' grating voice (like fingernails on a chalkboard) completely ruin "Strong Enough."  Chrissie sounds like a zombie on "If It Makes You Happy", Sarah McLaughlin is so hopelessly unhip and white-bread in her Lilith-Fair mode that she adds nothing to "A Difficult Kind"...in fact, by the end of the song Sarah seems to disappear from the song as Sheryl belts it to the end.  That's Sheryl's song and should remain so,  Tombstone Blues stands out for its guitar work and the best part of "All I Wanna Do" is the New York audience.  Happy, White Room and Gold Dust Woman are three classic rock standards, so overplayed that anyone who grew up to 70's FM AOR radio has heard them ad nauseaum.  Problem here is that nothing new is added to them, they sound like karaoke versions.  Despite Sheryl's plea for patience, I was bored with the old-timers.They didn't bring Sheryl's career forward, only backwards	0

0312965338:better_than_"into_thin_air":ren_hoek	"The Climb" was written by Bourkeev and DeWalt as an answer to Krakaur's "Into Thin Air". While not showcasing the same prose as Krakaur's book, I feel that this is utlamitely better. My reasoning for this opinion is that "The Climb" seems like a much more fair and unbiased account. Bourkeev does not resort to playing the blame game; he simply tells the story as he experienced it. Krakaur, it seemed to me at least, relied to heavily on assumptions, and we all now what happens when you assume (hint: you make an _____ out of you and me) and came off as very arrogant and (for some reason) took a feverious dislike to Bourkeev and Lopsang. Thought not as well written as "Into Thin Air", "The Climb" still managed to draw me in fully, although some parts of the book are a little confusing, mainly the interview with Bourkeev about his single handed rescue of three striken climbers who otherwise would have surely perieshed. This interview was conducted in English, the only problem with that is that Bourkeev's English is not very strong! It is passable and most of the time you can understand him but in other parts it is very hard to dechyper. DeWalt tries to help by adding "translations" about what Bourkeev is saying but I felt the interview should have been caried out in Bourkeev's native tongue of Russian and then translated into English. To not have done this is a great injustice to Bourkeev. If you want to read a fair and unbiased book about the May 1996 Everest tragidy that was written simply to tell the truth and not to play smeer tatics and make money (as Krakaur's clearly was), read this. I really recommend you read both books, though and also check out the IMAX movie "Everest".	1
B000ESLJNK:too_good...:carrie_purkerson	This spread is way too good!  My husband and I have both tried spreading it on toast, but it really stands alone.  I like to eat it just straight out of the jar.  The spread is a perfect blend of flavors.  If you have a sweet tooth, and don't always have other sweets on hand, a spoon of this stuff will satisfy all your cravings.  Unfortunately, this spread has no nutritional value to speak of, so I doubt I will order it again.  6 jars is plenty for us.  You have to order it at least once, though!	1
B000700JNG:excellent_case!:jonathan_perry	After reading the reviews here of this case, I thought I'd take the plunge and try it.

502029	This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice	0

Earlier this year PC Mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers.  Before the change this was a magazine that I would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content; now I can skim it in 5 minutes and don't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time.  As a longtime subscriber (20 years) I will not be re-subscribing to the magazine.  I wish them luck, but I believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	0
B0007IR4Q8:citizen_watch:william_j._schork	The first watch had a broken crown the date could not be changed.To amazons credit,they sent me a new one right away.This watch is fine.I needed a rubber band because I am in water a great deal of the time at workand I live near the ocean.I am always in the water with my children.So far the watch is great and has held up to expectations.No problems except when the first one was shipped broken.I would buy it again	1

192114	This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.	0

But after I looked at the pictures again.. man.. how brilliant! They should've provided some sort of User Guide on how to put the case on. And the leather is of a very high quality too. The seller is awesome, very Amazon-like shipping (i.e. fast)	1
0590108840:very_pleased:coolslaw	This is a simple book to read through for younger children. Written by native Americans it is a "thanksgiving" book from their point of view, why native americans have always celebrated thanksgiving. It has no mention of pilgrams or not fully proven, overly romanticized stories as most thanksgivings are but simply a beautiful description of the season, the great harvest and respect for the world around them. A book of why the Native Americans Gave thanks during this beautiful season	1

B000A3MM2G:picky_taste:jes	I didn't realize how picky my taste is with rings until I scoured Amazon for hours looking for something that would interest me.  This ring is one of the few I found, and I am far from a fan of having stones in my rings.  It has a nice low profile.  I've yet to have it catch on anything.  I'm also not a fan of open knot work on rings, but this again managed to sidestep that distaste.  The stone has no backing, so it gets an interesting red tinge in the middle, tinted by my finger	1

It had no scartches or chips. I like it a lot and my daughter loves it. we havent converted it to a toddler bed or the full bed shes only 2. But its very roomy. It can get dented a little easily as when she banged a toy on it there were some dents but since its in white you dont notice it that much.	1

B00020V5A2:makes_a_hard_task_easier:cruzshopper	I purchased this video monitor based on the reviews to help me care for my elderly mother who is under hospice care.

The picture quality is great and the sound is amazing - I can detect changes in her breathing from the other end of the house!	1

B00021E5OE:good_but_not_perfect:t._perry	Murad promises the miracle cure for acne. While the product is good, it's not a miracle. I've been usines Murad for two months and while my skin has improved, it's not flawless. I still get break outs and they still take a while to heal. I'll keep using it because it's a skin routine as good as any other and who knows, maybe my skin will improve	1
B000AEOFFM:great_toy_for_the_price:carrie_garcia	I bought this toy because Amamzon's price was a great bargin compared to other stores.  I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way.  There is a lot more room for more logs.  115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front.  I ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	1

B00065H570:great_car_keys:b._hanson	I purchased the Parents Magazine version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this Hasbro toy I purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since.  The buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time.  He also enjoys teething on the keys.  I highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys	1

532543	We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line	0
B00005B6ZR:do_not_buy_this!!:	I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn't even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!	0
B000JGD5CA:low_suction:lambert_b._ross_"blue_man"	This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.

511948	This is a charming little book.  It's very concise, profusely illustrated, and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids.  It delightfully summarizes the work of Plato/Theaetetus, Archimedes, Euclid, Kepler, and Euler in only 57 pages, half of which contain only illustrations.  As a model-builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra, I was a little concerned when I looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about "sacred geometry."  Fortunately (at least from my point of view) it does not contain a word about it, except for a cursory reference to the elements Plato associated with each of the Platonic Solids.  A table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge/radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids--all the info a model builder needs!  This book won't impress anyone with a mathematics background, but for a layman like me, it's a perfect introduction.  Kudos to Sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format	1

B00070Q2VE:depends_on_what_you_are_looking_for_in_a_knitting_mag:isabella_k._badenoch_"izi"	I have been a long time subscriber to Vogue Knitting, it was one of the few US knitting magazines that had really fashionable knitting patterns. I am from Germany, where there are lots of knitting magazines with really chic patterns, I missed that when I moved to the US. However, I find that the content in Vogue Knitting really fluctuated - sometimes it was packed with great designs, sometimes, it was just too far out and there wasn't a single pattern I wanted to knit. I stopped my subscription for a while. Then the editor changed and now the magazine is somewhere in the middle - not too funky, yet still chic and fun. I still enjoy reading it every once in a while.	1
B0001CCY0G:yngwie_spoils_the_whole_thing:br_rk	This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.	1
461479	I can understand that Robin felt a need to include some of the biggest Bee Gees hits to appease the fans, but the ones that were sung by Barry are below wretched here.  Robin frequently disappears in the sound mix, becoming little more than one of a group singing harmony.  That's fine for a group concert, like the Bee Gees, but inexcusable for a solo effort.  His stiff between song talk sounds like a bad lounge act.  They should have kept this in the can.  It seems like it is meant as little more than a money grab for Robin. Don't do him the favor	0
B000GTSHLE:a_must_have_for_every_breastfeeding_mom:jennifer_suarez	This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!	1
B0009VAFRI:the_best_creatine_+_nitric_oxide_workout_surge:peopleinmotion	The two most respected bodybuilding supplements are (1)Whey Protein and (2)Creatine. They are also considered natural products or food products. While whey is without a doubt extremely useful, creatine does not help everybody. I have used creatine monohydrate in the past and I found it to be useless. It was so utterly ineffective that I just felt robbed of my hard earned money. My tub still sits in the cupboard. I have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are. I heard about NO-XPLODE from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years. I researched it and it appears that BSN has formulated a surging "Creatine + Nitric Oxide" drink that seems to work with most people. Not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts. Although NO-XPLODE contains some serious chemistry (see below) and possibly some debatable compounds (Guanidino Propionic Acid [GPA] and Glycocamine) it is probably well worth the very low-level risks for the results. 40 minutes after taking this stuff I can either cardio high intensity for 30 min flat (maybe even more) and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power. No fatigue. The surge is exactly as it promises. You will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body. It sets in at about 20 minutes for me. I feel a little woozy at first, disorientated, then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic. Put it into action and you will see results.  It also boats a CEM3 type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does. I never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion NO-XPLODE is standing on the fence saying I am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects. So far this stuff is getting very good feedback. Yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients, but if you are looking for the creatine edge, even if creatine has never worked for you before, then NO-XPLODE is probably the one. It can also help build muscle, but even if it doesn't for you, it is still worth it for the surge. I am very glad that I got it. Very.	1
B0002E2GQU:nice_value_for_daily_espresso.:christopher_michael_"sean"	The roast is more smooth and mellow than Starbucks. I prefer it to Illy. Produces ample crema. It's a good value.

FWIW I grind with a Rancilio Rocky burr grinder, and my espresso machine is a Rancilio Miss Silvia	1
B00061N02S:jarlesburg,_but_not_cheddar:john_d._hearn_"mathematician"	I have been looking for a good cheese plane, and this one isn't it.  It works fine for rubbery semi-soft cheeses like swiss, but not for harder cheese like cheddar, which tend to crrumble before I can finish a slice.  The problem is that the plane it too thick and rigid.  It should be thin and flexible.	0
B0002AHQSM:great_camera_case!_:amirah_aboutalebi	This camera case is great.  It's very small and fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly.  There is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries (but the batteries make it tight).  I originally purchased the camera case listed for the 4600, but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren't careful.  This camera case does not come with a strap like the other, but that is something I would never use.  I highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera.	1

B000000WFF:cruel_brittania:david_baldwin	Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly"	0

281752	There is a pattern in Hollywood when it comes to drama/revenge films such as Eye for an Eye.  It is an extremely simple pattern that is regenerated time and time again because audiences like to not be surprised.  They are prepared for the bad guy to die at the end, whilst the victim or top-billed actor/actress comes out as the hero at the end.  It is meant to give us a sense of security and comfort, but for this critic it is getting old.  Eye for an Eye is a perfect example of film that falls deep within that tired genre of film.  From the opening credits of this film, you could count the steps that each actor was going to make all the way to the very end.  The pauses could be guessed, the lines could have been written the night before, and the acting was nothing short of mediocrity at its best.  It was guaranteed that the actors would be overly dramatic, the violins would always shrill around Kiefer, and there would be horrendously underdeveloped plotlines that would lead nowhere.  This is your typical revenge film with no excitement, no frills, nothing that would make it stand out from the rest.  The late director John Schlesinger played it safe with one of his final films, which will promise to bore and completely not satisfy you to the bitter end.	0

The product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper. Assembly took around 30 minutes. As others have commented the holes don't line up naturally and did require some "finessing" in order to get lined up, but really wasn't that difficult to overcome. All that is required for assembly is a 4mm allen wrench which is provided (although the end started to get worn 1/2 way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench). Probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs. This seems like a good quality that I am confident will last for many years to come	1

1885477724:scarey_cover:rachel_s._haverly_"kiwi_mum"	I just had my two and a half year old son evaluated as having SI.  The therapist recommended this book.  I found other reviews interesting and was immediately put off by the cover I am looking for whatever positive help I can get.  I wish more was known about this condition.  Or that I knew of a support group as I don't have any family who live anywhere close around me.  My son has an amazing memory and is very lively and outgoing.  He also has extreme tantrums and throws things and seemed to get really fustrated so some of the SI checklist definetly applyed and made sense.  He also is very keyed into me and I can't even get in the shower or go to the bathroom without him getting upset.  Some of what they state didn't seem to fit him though like he crawled and walked early and seemed to have good co-ordination eating with a spoon or fork?	0

Wait a bit - mine received a signal about 3 minutes later, some people have to wait overnight. It receives radio signals from Colorado and it will readjust itself nightly to keep near perfect time. It will also factor in Daylight Savings Time. These it does well - and so it gets 5 stars because it does what it is supposed to do.	1
477041	Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves gameplay, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predescessor.	0
528737	This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls	0

B00021BMYK:love_it:donna_e._hoskins	The first thing you notice is the clean burst of citrus. It's yummy and fresh and sexy. Then the fragrance reveals its deeper layers and you are drawn in. This is a wonderful fragrance for men. Both of Vera Wang's fragrances (for men and women) are top quality, multi layered, emminently pleasing, and would make fabulous gifts.

528347	We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it	0
1595541578:biggest_waste_of_time_ever!:kimberly_c._mann_"super_mom"	One star is too generous!  AAARRRGGGH!  I am still mad about this book and I read it 3 books ago!  I loved Ted Dekker's "Three" and I enjoyed Peretti's children's books I read with my kiddos, so I was looking forward to the arrival of a collaboration.  But it was utterly silly!  If I start a book, I have to finish it.  Okay, that's my own fault, but I had to MAKE myself read this to get it over with!  I wanted to burn the book when I was finished to make sure nobody else I knew ever read my copy.	0
B00006KPSW:so_cool:	I love this magazine! I love how the main message is "be yourself!" It has no advertizments and it doesn't say you have to be beautiful to be happy. I'm really tom-boy, and alot of other magazines make you feel like "normal" girls are obsessed with IMing, fashion, makeup, and boys! I hate those magazines! Read " A TOTAL SUCKER!!!!" another review of this magazine, it says that "normal" teenage girls, have crushes, and hate to be out of style! Am I like that? NO WAY! This magazine is just right, it has probably 1 TRUE artical about that stuff, but it's not really flirty or something! GET THIS MAGAZINE!	1

15298	Touchstone features articles, editorials, book reviews and other material from the perspective of Protestant (both mainline and evangelical), Catholic and Orthodox Christians who hold to traditional, orthodox understandings of Christian morality.  It tackles the tough issues of our time both in scholarly articles and practical advice for parents who must raise children to be faithful in a post-Christian culture.  While it does not seek a false ecumenicalism which demands unity at all cost (see the July/August 2003 issue on "Christian Unity & the Divisions we must Sustain"), it also recognizes that orthodox believers of all three major branches of Christianity must work together on moral issues on which we all agree.	1

B0000669AJ:great_toy!:lynnie	My eight-month-old daughter really loves these instruments! We bought them when she was about four months old, but when she picked them up she'd often clunk her head with them when she tried to wave them around.  I brought them back out when she was six months old and had a lot more arm control.  Now she really goes wild with them, especially the bells!	1

TurboTax may be more expensive, but it's well worth it to save the headaches that this program caused. If you have complicated tax forms or unusual tax situations (or prefer an intuitive program, rather than something that makes you say "What am I supposed to do next???") stick with TurboTax	0

Following the instructions he laid the unit down on it's face, of course the kick-board had already been added so it didn't lay flat. When nailing on the backing the "J" board (the center shelf holding the entire unit together) split at every point of contact.	1

Does that mean they are following a liberal agenda? I think not	1

B000ALBLKM:can't_live_without_this!:melleno	I'm not a makeup or product junkie by any means, but simply can't miss even one day of using my All About Lips. It is a cream (much like a moisturizer) that exfoliates and smoothes your lips and makes them fuller/plumper. It also fills in any lines you may have around the mouth so I recommend using it not only on your lips but also outside the lipline. Although I have been using it twice daily for many years, I believe someone using it for the first time should see results fairly quickly.	1

B000HCTYRG:surprisingly_clumsy_software:r._mcdonald	Several years ago I used DeLorme's Street Atlas with a USB GPS receiver. The software worked but the interface was lousy. This year I tried Microsoft's Streets and Trips 2007 and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the Delorme software, but still surprisingly clumsy. And the help is possibly the worst I have seen in a Microsoft product (that's saying a lot). Here are some of the problems:	0
286420	I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website	1
219128	I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The &quot;main&quot; characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored	0
B00024CKA2:good_for_a_healthy_chocolate_fix:p._stanfield	I love all the varieties of chocolate, and if you mix them in a blender, they are smooth and creamy.  You can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes, and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake.  Shaking by hand or using a hand-held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice.  These are a great meal replacement - healthy, nutritious, and full of quality protein.	1
B000FTXNRI:not_well_designed:jason_jackson_"jason_lee_jackson"	Like many my age, I grew up with Legos.  My wife bought this kit for me for Christmas.  I was excited.  After a couple of days of work, my excitement had turned to frustration and finally to anger.  This kit is poorly designed, and the instructions are not well thought out.  First, the "Death Star" is built on a base that you construct of Legos.  This base is not very sturdy.  The instructions said to put a bunch of parts just on one side.  Left alone, the structure would tip over because of the imbalance.  Much of the structure had such flimsy connections that the slightest thing would break connections.  I don't mean the quality of the Legos; those things are impossible to break.  I mean the way in which various bars, hinges, etc were put together.	0

These gloves were a great find and the price was right	1
B0002CZYIY:a_rehearsal_workhorse:aaron_rubenson_"frugal_tenor"	This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use	1
B00014VTNW:secret_pleasure__&__nutritional_powerhouse:mtspace_"reader,_cook,_gardener,_critic"	My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim "Love it or Hate it"  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.	1
B000HAEK6I:movie_is_great,_but_unbox_is_uncooked:james_k._hurd_"old_fella"	Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it	0
B00080Q2LS:cute_and_dainty:fdlewis	I received this pair of hoop earrings as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend.  When I first open the box, I thought they were earrings for an infant.  The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute.  As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them.  They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession.  If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item	1
B000GTDZBG:airsplat_service_stinks--avoid_them:james_c._laughrey_"jlaughry"	I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift.

THIS SET MADE A NICE ADDITION TO HIS GROWING COLLECTION AND THE PRICE WAS NICE TOO. THE WOODEN TRAINS ARE A BIT EXSPENSIVE BUT ARE WELL WORTH IT IN THE LONG RUN DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY WILL BE PLAYED WITH FOR YEARS TO COME UNLIKE MOST OTHER TOYS THAT CHILDREN OUTGROW OR BECOME BORED WITH ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY RECIEVE THEM	1
B000225ZTW:just_average:d._mitrevski_"jmitrevski2"	I have to agree with another reviewer. This product is not worth the price tag. It claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. Don't buy this product based on how it smells. As a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.	0
B000EDGO2Q:dvd_has_a_conflict!:byepy	I buy this dvd from Amazon and try to play it but my desktop can't read any data on the dvd, like it's blank.

B000LIMN6K:what_do_you_do_when_it_is_windy?:steven_r._gruchawka_"shop_till_you_drop"	When it is windy, the top of a canopy like this needs to be removed to prevent wind damage. No information is available on how long it takes to do this. I called D.C. America and they say they are only distributors and buy it overseas and have no idea and have no manuals available online for me to look at. They said it takes a few hours to assemble or disassemble. One retailer I spoke with, Fogdog, guesses it would need to be disassembled to remove the top, but he admitted they have not tried assembling it.	0

B0002E1NNM:long_lasting_strings...:l._pifer_"techie"	I have found the many of the same things to be true as the previous reviewer.  If you want a brighter Elixir, they also make NanoWeb versions with a lighter coating.  They do wear out quicker though.	1
B0009VRPOO:noisy:b._burton	My husband and I recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy. The noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby.  We were greatly disappointed	0
B0001V2MY0:interlink_remotepoint_is_poorly_designed:joachim_isaac	I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!	0
376332	This is a great piece of hardware, the wireless rear speakers was a big selling point for me. But in my apartment I would like to have more control over the subwoofer speaker, it's volume slider is hidden in a settings menu there is no separate knob for it on the speaker itself. The bass sound from subwooferis overbearing at default. The other thing is that I would like to be able to have better control over the sound itself with an equalizer. That's not going to happen with this system, you can't change that easily. And yes the 5 disk changer is slow. The maximum volume setting doesn't seem that loud to me, but then I have the decibal settings at default. All the sound quality you expect from a theater system is here, it has all the flavors. Hooking it up to an xbox directly didnt work the way I'd like it too, but I only tried RCA and not the digital. I have a sony 32" Wega and I had the xbox patch to it and then routed to the DAV-FX100 reciever. That works like a charm, even with 5.1 sound from XBOX. One huge complaint I have is the shielding for the mid and left and right front speakers are not the best. I see a bit of haze from the magnetic fields from both the front 3 speakers, even had to elevate my center channel for fear that would permanently damage the tube on my TV. There is mention of this problem in the manual but that should be on the front page not the middle of the manual! Beware! Four Stars	1

B000CQDHY8:sony_vrd-mc1:j._stadler	I have purchased over two dozen of these units. This is the best unit for the price. There are a few things that are a real plus one is the small screen on the unit. This allows you to be certain that your feed is being input. Also the card slots are a plus. Two things to be aware of. If you are using the unit in colder temperatures the unit will need to sit and warm up before use. Apparently there is some type of a dew sensor built in. Also if  you are transferring images from a card you have to look at the manual to determine what type of disc is required. Not a one disc does all unit	1
13515	This is one of the many magazines that float around the school library, and it is the most common.  Maybe because not too many people read it.  All that is in it is pure celebrity gossip. There is really nothing else in here.  If you like blurry photos of Lindsay Lohan, Donald Trump, Paris Hilton, Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and the like, (blurry so you can't see the zits and the flaws) then you should get this.  One article mentioned Britney Spears stomach, how it was coming back.  She was wearing a baggy t-shirt.  Baggy t-shirts are common among women wanting to hide a gut, not flaunt it.  This magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic (they don't-not so far as I can tell).  If you want to read about the fact that Nichole Richie has acquired yet another Chloe Paddington, the fact that Donald Trump thinks his wife Melania looks hideous now that he has gotten her knocked up, or you would like to see photos of Victoria Beckham looking pissed off, then read this. This magazine is full of lies as well-for instance, one writer claims that young people like Lindsay Lohan can get higher car insurance rates for accidents they were not at fault in.  False!  You only get higher rates if you are at fault. This magazine is nothing more than an overpriced tabloid.  There is nothing of value in here. Half the time the insider is some anonymous friend, and half the time the facts aren't right. Avoid this thing at all costs, unless of course you are a celebrity worshipper.

B000MAV2XW:ok_for_legs:christy_g._hutson_"chefgreen2002"	The shave gel bars that are attached to this razor extend out past the razor making a close shave nearly impossible. This razor worked ok on my legs where an extreme smoothe surface is not necesssary. But using this on the the more intimate areas is just frustrating because the gel bars did not allow the razor to get close enough to the skin. This razor does not poduce a light lather, it is more like a slime that drips from it. I did not notice a tropical scent	0
B000BU5PAO:an_amusing_hat,_but_be_informed...:everett_hall	Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares	0
B00005RJ39:maybe_a_good_film_but_not_a_true_story_-_warning,_spoilers!:zachary_l._stauber_"anchorite"	There are so many reviews saying this is a true story I have to point out that while the war and the deployment were real (obviously), about everything else is dramatized (including the mission objectives: SCUD hunting on foot, which is a joke to anyone who knows how wars are fought today). McNab has essentially written Tom Clancy genre fiction. The book Bravo Two Zero differs in details with another book written by a second member of the patrol, Chris Ryan, called The One That Got Away. However, both are convincingly debunked by a third SAS memeber in a book called The Real Bravo Two Zero, also available on Amazon, though only the UK Amazon site (which you can still order from in the US). In it, an SAS member who can actually speak Arabic retraces the patrol using both books as guides and talks to all the people McNab and Ryan supposedly killed and gets their side of the story. Most importantly, he manages to restore, without a doubt, the reputation of Vince Phillips, blamed by Ryan for getting the patrol discovered by the Iraqis and a couple members eventually killed. Contrary to what you may expect, I would recommend seeing this, in fact I recommend getting and comparing all three books: B20, The One That Got Away, and The Real B20	0
82438	I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.	0
121728	The classic Final Fantasy games (1-3 [not 6]) are NOTORIOUS for their difficulty.  This does not hold true until you reach the center of the moon.   Then, you will find yourself guzzling Elixirs, Potions, and Ethers just to kill ONE monster.  For example, the Behemoths (found past B5 in the center of the moon, and in Bahamuts cave) will counter every spell and attack with a brutal 2300 hit on one party member.  Most of the boss fights (Asura, Bahamut) and tough monsters (Behemoths, Wicked Masks) are gimmick fights.  Bahamut is actually one of the easiest fights in the game, just cast Reflect on all of your party members.	1
B000BM8FRC:great_bottle:k.p._"addison's_mommy"	I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems	1

B000056JA2:finally,_peace_of_mind!:n._calabrese	I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.	1

69944	The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.	1
B00094E8TG:halogen_desk_lamp:w._ford	Good buy.  Heavy, but had to add rubber/plastic "feet" on bottom to make stable, keep the lamp from rocking, and scratch desk top.  Good reach with 22" arm, can adjust lamp up and down and move arm to sides, but can't angle the light to side.  All-in-all, a good lamp for the price	1
B000GKVQDY:exactly_what_we_needed...:carol_roetto	We heat our home with a coal stove, so when it comes time to put the baby down I worry that the room might become too cold.  With this monitor I can keep an ear on the baby at the same time as keeping an eye on the temperature and humidity level in her room.  The humidity level comes in handy during cold season, I've found.  The night light on this monitor is great, it's very adjustable or you can shut it off altogether.  I've not owned it very long, so I can't comment on durability yet, but so far so good.  My [..] has dropped the parent receiver once or twice and it's still fine.  I would definitely recommend this monitor, thank God the price was right too	1

B000060MUD:effective...but_boring!:kelly_nixon	I've owned this workout for about three years.  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to shape.  It does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body.  However, I have to force myself to do this video.  The 35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired.  By the time I finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating.  In order for me to get through the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.	0
B000F1LMZG:garbage:jessica_a._lepore	The phone may be fine but I will never know because my Virgin Mobile service never really worked. Perhaps it was the phones fault I never received text messages even though they were being deducted from my account. Overall their customer service is AWFUL. Days of waiting and receiving no information. I had to file 4 investigations because they would close them without resolving the issue or they were not filled out right. I spent hours on the phone with them and never had the problem fixed. Now I have thrown away a bunch of money for crappy service. I plan to just run out the minutes and then disconnect the phone. Its garbage.	0

B00006IEBI:the_greatest_pen_ever:m._neal	Let me tell you how wonderful these pens are: whenever I'm writing with another pen, I find myself longing for the Pilot V5. After writing with these for 7 years, there's just nothing else that compares. For me, the Pilot is the most conducive pen in getting the thoughts in my head onto paper. It's smooth and fluid, writes with the epitome of ease and precision, and has a nice minimalist look. I'v graduated to buying these in boxes rather than just single pens because I hate being without them and having to use &quot;other&quot; pens. Once you try the V5, you'll know what I mean	1
B000EZMHCK:great_for_cooking,_serving,_&_storing_*****:furbabies_"furbabies"	I took a chance on ordering these, and I'm glad I did.  They are heavy-duty!  I like the handles as I do a lot of microwave cooking and it's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware.  I've also used these in a convection oven, and them seem to work really great!  I picked the "Sapphire" color, and they are very attractive on the table as well!	1
490922	The pro and cons described by other reviews are valid. I was specifically looking for a boombox that has cassette, mp3, cd and radio capability. So didn't have much of an option but to get this one. I am impressed with the sound quality but agree that there could have been improvements related to interface and some of the functionality. Overall I think its a good buy.	1

B0008JFO5O:bonkers!:mike_strickland_"mike"	We recently played BONKERS at our game club. As we read the instructions we were hoping going BONKERS would be fun and it was. BONKERS is a game based on asking players questions.  The questions are not trivia and knowledge-based questions, but instead word-based questions.  For instance, a question might ask you to "Come up with words that end in BELL".  During your turn you have 30 seconds to "Go Bonkers" trying to blurt out answers like: BARBELL; DUMBBELL; DOORBELL, COWBELL etc.  Your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card.   For every answer you hit, you win scoring chips. That was just one category of questions called ADD ONS - where you find words that begin or end with a certain word.  The other categories are:  WHAT THE BLANK - where you find words to complete the blank;  RHYME TIME - where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card; and LETTER PERFECT - where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters.  The game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in.  At the beginning of the round, one player (the Card Reader) peeks at the Question and Answers on Game Card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth.  So, in the example above, the card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips to the answer COWBELL, four chips to BARBELL, three chips to DUMBELL and two chips to DOORBELL.  This is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer "A"; "B", "C" or "D".  The object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer.  This is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card, the Card Reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the Board.   However, if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card, they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided.  I really like the strategy part of the game, it adds a good deal of spice.  BONKERS provided for an entertaining evening.  We will play again!	1
B000F3AA20:best_psychopathic_album_ever!!!:cali_juggalo_"hatchetman20"	This is by far the best psychopathic album ever released. Riddlebox is now in second place. Madrox schools ever other artist on psychopathic with this album. Beats are bangin' and lyrics are flawless! Great flows and he mixes funny with wicked. Best songs are This B*tch and Hey Phatty. Great album by the best rapper of our time. Madrox is so under rated. I wish for his sake he would blow up huge but not lose his soul in the process. Buy this album, best rap album ever made	1

It doesn't look like it is included as offered.  The quick connect adapter by itself won't do you any good	1
741	The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania.

Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!	0

464638	I think this my first EP purchase ever - and I generally feel that, despite the quality many offer, EPs just are not worth it. Sam Beam was clearly on a mission to change my mind, as these apparent "outtakes" from The Creek Drank The Cradle are every bit as good as that miracle debut - if not better. I only very recently discovered Iron and Wine through Our Endless Numbered Days, and have since been backtracking only to see that this remarkably talented artist can do no wrong. The standout track to me is The Night Descending, it has the feel of a track pulled right out of the past. The other four tracks are just as excellent though, and I think Sam's managed to make an avid fan out of me. Damn... and just when I thought there were no new artists to be excited about!	1

However, with my first "Eagle" the alarm didn't go off. Amazon was great about the exchange for a new one (kudos). My repacement is a disappointment in that sometimes the backlight won't light up and I have to hit the clock on the bottom to get the light to go on. I second the others raters who have complained about the bad viewing angle. The loud alarm almost gave me and my wife a heart attack the first morning, but I put a piece of scotch tape over it and that seem to tame it enough.	0

44791	I got a free one year sub. to another gaming mag. with purchase of a game at GameStop.

Finally I went on their site to complain, and they promised to send extra issues to make up for it.

75631	I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang.	1
B0009ANJMM:great_for_both_of_my_girls:a._mcgraw_"busy_mom_of_3"	My daughter got this for her 6th birthday.  She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.  One of them is using it all the time.  The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her.  My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD.  My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can.  Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD.  I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat	1

332533	This book is the equivalent of the Proustian madeleine...to read it is to recover a past long lost. Making the case for the mordant paradigm shift of US morals, ethics and literary tastes, this is the marker past which one can see the sad decline of the quality of art and life in the modern world. I cannot improve on the highly intelligent and sensitive overview given here by reviewer Big Orange "paxbear" and so will not review the book in detail. That it is one of only three Saroyan volumes still in print makes the case for the obsolesence of the clear heart and clear mind in today's mindlessly kinetic world. You can read this book in the time it would take you to go see MI 111 in a cineplex. Carpe diem. Read this instead	1
B0000T0O0W:poorly_made_&_breaks_easily:john_m._perlin_"jperlin"	I bought this stepper to use when I am on the road for work.  After 3 days, 10 min/day the "PLASTIC" wheel bent out of shape and allowed the guide wire to fall off.  I replaced the wire and began again.  It was to no avail because the shape of the wheel was now distorted the wire would not stay in place and eventually the metal wire snapped.  The company, Spartan, actually replaced the entire stepper but the same thing happened.  The unit is rated for a max load of 220 lbs.  I am below that weight but it still broke.  If Spartan is serious about this product then change the plastic wheel to steel, or rework the entire mechanism.  This design flaw is totally uncalled for and easily corrected.  The rest of the construction appears to be sturdy except for this crucial part.  Since this product was manufactured in China it is easy to see that the company placed more emphasis on cost than reliabilty.  STAY AWAY!  This product was made for extremely light people, not for people who are serious about getting in shape and staying there	0

Throw it in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. That's it.	1
107575	There is little more I can contribute to this literary masterpiece--even though the essential structure of my review is clear in my mind, it will not be able to truly capture the magnificent splendor of this work. Gustave Flaubert was a conscientious literary artist who revised and perfected Madame Bovary with care. He worked on the novel for nearly six years, during which time he rewrote the manuscript several times, often spending days perfecting a single paragraph. The result of his painstaking creativity was a masterpiece that rivals the heavens with its beauty. Madame Bovary is a penetrating psychological study of its heroine, Emma Bovary, as she struggles to find fulfillment through a realization of her romantic fantasies of love and wealth. She exists in a dream world and longs for freedom from her middle-class humdrum lifestyle. Flaubert's realistic portrait of the tragic fate of this complex woman is nothing short of phenomenal.	1

B0001F1ZVW:unfortunate_design:karen_elaine	I have the same criticisms as many others.  I had to put on rubber gloves to open the battery compartment.  After turning it off after the first use, I couldn't get it turned back on again and returned it to the store.  I loved the size, but I bought a nice wireless by Microsoft; not a mini, but easy to use, a battery compartment that opens without difficulty, and a nifty little snap-in receiver that turns the mouse off automatically.  Take it out, put it in the usb port and the mouse is back on again.  Price was comparable, even though I pay a lot more for these items, living in the Caribbean.  Amazon does not ship anything but books, cd's and dvd's to the Caribbean	0

B000H34WTA:research_kamado_before_buying:m._clark_"truth_in_q,_we_trust"	I am the owner of a kamado, purchased in August of 2000 when the company wan located in Sacramento, CA. After owning the unit for less than two years, I started to develop cracks in the interior of the kamado. the company would not replace or honor the life time warranty on the unit. Since that time the tiles have come loose in sheets and I have a defective unit that is unsightly and not what I purchased with the supposed lifetime warranty. All calls and emails to the company would not resolve the defects in materials and workmanship. The company's answer is to glue the tiles back on the unit. This is not acceptable for a unit of this cost. Check and see if you unit is made from ceramic materials or from Portland cement as in the case of mine. unless kamado has changed their manufacturing process in Ensenada, Mexico the units are made of Portland cement. This material will not last and carries no lifetime warranty. I am sorry to give them one star, they don't have a negative star number. check out this company with San Diego BBB and Sacramento BBB and read before you buy.

More of an end-of-the-night activity... unless you're just having a dessert party of course! My one complaint is the impractical (although oh-so-whimsical) tissue packaging. It is hazardously absorbent. Even the assertive flavors of these high-quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items. Note: do not store next to your curry sampler...	1

B0000AE7CE:hands_down_the_worst_of_the_series_(that_has_to_do_with_michael).:squash_'n'_squeak_"the_silencing_machine"	Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3	0
B0009RG8X2:best_money_spent!!!:sydni_b._gwinn_"delaney's_mom"	Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.  After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was.  Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm.  No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.  Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it.  Love it Love it	1

B000IKX5IG:buyer_beware:paul_ipsaro	I wish I could write a review of this product, unfortunately I cannot because the vendor (Verdent) is dishonest. You see Amazon requires all outside vendors to ship all orders within two business days. Verdent Gifts thought they could just sidestep this little detail, not ship my order for 9 days and feed me a line of BS on top of that. Yes, I called the vendor and he told me quote " we are having a difficult time getting UPS to pick up our orders", what a crock unless you are't paying your UPS shipping bills.	0

B000EIE20M:the_best!:pokohoho_"book_lover"	My cousin-in-law is Thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us.  I had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple.  Just get the green Mae Ploy curry paste, some Asian basil, and some coconut milk.  A little salt, sugar, chicken, some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things I would need to make it.  Well, I couldn't believe it was really THAT simple, but it was!  The paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry.  Tastes like you slaved for hours.  I never have leftovers when I make this curry.  The paste is so low priced I plan to stock up so I'll always have some on hand.  Plus-- no preservatives, no wierd ingredients.  It's all food stuffs, albiet some of the ingredients I don't recognize... what is a galangal?  Whatever it all is, sure tastes good	1

428600	Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter.	0

B000GI0HR2:absolute_garbage:t._katen	I've been using Quicken for over a decade, and I have to admit it is critical to my personal financial management.  But I had no reason to upgrade from Quicken 2004 until Intuit decided to "break" it and force the upgrade by crippling certain features.  Quicken 2007 for Mac's feature set is not significantly different from the 2004 version, much less 2005 or 2006, and is certainly inferior to Quicken for Windows.  That's bad enough but Quicken 2007 is also WAY less stable than my prior version (I'm using the R2 update).  It crashes frequently.  Bottom line, Intuit should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for putting this garbage on the market.  I for one will never buy another one of their products and recommend the same for everyone else out there	0
396432	They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.	0

B000BO0KNM:titus,_something_special_for_everyone:walter_suchara	When this show was on back in the day on Fox I couldnt believe I was actually watching something I could relate to. There doesnt seem to be really that many Tv shows that deal with dark and The Real Life experinces of Real People. If ya ask me when it was on. It was actually something that gave me some relief. I deal everyday with some experinces re-lated to the show. Its somewhat of a constant battle. Enough about me. Im really glad all 3 Seasons are out. And im also glad I didnt have to wait many years either. One thing I didnt like about Fox when Titus was on they kept moveing it around. It wasnt fair for the show. Then the next thing ya know there were some repeats then it was gone. Im not really happy with Fox cause Titus still should be on tv or had a much longer run then it did. I hope Chris shows up in something else soon. Hes got one of those faces ya never forget	1

B000002X3W:the_singing_brakeman_!:mcgivern_owen_l	"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas".  There are also fine versions of "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less well known.  These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe bet.  Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Further, the "Essential" series of albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that category	1

592889	JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT  THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC	0
522635	all things aside, the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end [stated this way without ruining the ending]played a great part as a supporting actor. his name is justin goncalves i think. this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played. in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid. believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had. i was particularly impressed with the part he played.	1
B0009I6RFK:mere_words_cannot_plumb_the_depths_of_my_hatred.:k._mcneece_"pink_pimpernel"	Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too).  We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.).  Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time.  The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse.  After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before	0
B000FTV7PI:the_best_floss_aid_for_kids:james_koenig_"konedog4"	As a dentist of over 20+ years experience, I have seen over and over again the results of not flossing one's teeth.  The unfortunate result of such neglect is cavities (especially in kids), and inevitable gum disease in adults, which in both cass over time leads to tooth loss.  Gum disease almost always starts in-between the teeth and the only way to clean the germs that cause gum disease and cavities from between the teeth is with floss.  Mechanical scrubbing with floss is the key, and all the daily brushings and rinsings will not remove the in-between stubborn plaque below the gumline.  The bottom line is that we need to floss our teeth if we want to keep them for a lifetime.	1
B00025Z6UW:loving_it!:zena_anderson_"zenaa96"	My two tanks of Cichlids, Loaches and catfish love this food. Gives them high energy so they're active and interesting throughout the day.

400937	Are you looking for a way to get your kids into the kitchen, turing out tasty projects?  I know I was--and I went through about fifteen "kids" cookbooks at the local bookstore before I stumbled on this little gem.  It was the only cookbook (other than The Everything Kid's Cookbooks) that would actually get a child into the kitchen.  The projects are appealing on all levels--they are easy to assemble, they are too cute for words, and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions.	1

B000E18CVE:it's_unreal_how_good_the_kimchi_soup_is!:biz_book_girl	I've tried several of the Annie Chun flavors, and I liked most of them, but the Kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious! This is the BEST packaged soup product of any kind that I have ever tried, and I usually dislike canned or packaged soup products.  This is even better than my favorite canned Brunswick Stew that I have loved for so long!	1
B0001U6OYA:intermittant_performance:lorna_stribos	The unit has nice, large digits, but the wireless sensors don't work consistantly.  The system works for perhaps 3 days and then the wireless link goes down.  We have to remove the remote sensor batteries and reinstall them for the link to be re-established	0
B0001GBROQ:excellent_nostalgia_piece,_great_to_just_pick_up_and_go_with!!!:concerned_one_"thrashfan"	This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play	1
B000KG6NT6:looks_aren't_everything:dot_g._"shotz613"	We too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned.  We already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off, nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem.  Now a month after using the new one, its espresso pump is loud and noisy, sounding like its broken. Also for some reason or another it won't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso.  It ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out. But then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine.  Its been going for the last couple of days, but its such a iffy thing. On the plus side it does look nice! And it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work! My husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow, but he says that about everything	0

B000E9FRA0:not_like_any_other_summer_scent:bec_"bec16"	I'm a big fan of "non-traditional" perfumes - I don't care for sweet floraly scents, and I have been known to poach my man's cologne occassionally, just to enjoy the scent all day. So if you like citrusy/woodsy scents, you MUST try this one - it has an unusual top note and dry-down that are hard to describe, but anyway it never fails to get compliments from men, and the "WHAT are you wearing?" from women.	1
B000CSKK3W:just_does_not_taste_like_it_should:james_w._kelleher	I ordered the Corn on the Cobb popcorn since I could not find it in Phoenix anymore.  It tasted just like regular buttered popcorn.  In the past the popcorn literally tasted like Corn on the Cobb.  My family fought over it!  Not anymore!	0
B000AXSJDW:great_fryer!:doyle_brunson_"2ndamendmentguy"	I have used the fryer for chicken wings which is what I bought it for because I have plenty of parties throughout the year. Along with the professional look of the product, It performs great! If I could give it 10 stars I would. It is the best fryer I have ever used, and that says alot. I would recommend this fryer to anyone looking to enhance their outdoor cooking and bring it to that next "level".	1
580751	i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .	1
B00099YORC:slippery_slope:jonathan_dunn-rankin_"jonathan__dunn-rankin"	I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting	0
B00005OUEG:cute,_but_dangerous...:	I received these as a wedding gift.  Not, five of my tall glasses are broken, and two short glasses...none of which were from dropping them.  One broke as I was hand-washing them, and cut up my hand.  Another literally broke as a guest was drinking out of it.  I was so embarrassed	0
B000FITKK8:d-link_dgs-2208_8-port_10/100/1000_desktop_switch:a._wood	Switch was simple to install to my existing network, just plug and go. I used this switch to separate some CPUs off of the 100mb network and put them on the gig highway. Worked just as planned and was seamless. I actually added two of these and saved big jack over a 16 port gig switch. Network speed and response time increased even for those CPUs w/out a gig nic. I like the idea of having a switch with capacity that far exceeds network traffic. Highly recommend	1
B0000798KZ:great_until_it_breaks:j._odza	Like so many others have said, this was a great gate right up until it broke.  Each time the issue has been the lock freezing in place.  We are now purchasing our 5th one in 3 years, the previous 4 having broken after varying lengths of use.  Each time a gate has broken we've pondered what to do because we don't want to drill lots more holes for gates that might be equally disappointing, but we dare not go gateless with two toddlers and their not surprising interest in the stairs.  Argh!!!	0
B0006VWRYK:worthless:liora_hess	I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless.	0
B00092M354:good_curling_iron:blissfully_black	I was searching for a two inch curling iron for a while. I have had so -so dealings with Gold N Hot in the past so I was a little nervous but I purchased this one anyway. So far, so good. It's surprisingly light (at least compared to my one inch ceramic tools curling iron). I usually let my hair air dry and use my curling irons to straighten my hair as I curl the ends (I'm black with a relaxer.) I have yet to do it with this one. Although I might try b/c it gets really hot. (I usually have it on around 20-25 out of 30)	1

B000CA20XS:too_small:sad_eyes	While the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good, this pillow is too small to do an adult much good.  It is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose.  It could be perfect perhaps for a child	0

B000GWJD14:maybe_should_have_been_a_juicer:joanna	I purchased this orange humidifer and promptly returned it. I already have the penguin which is also by this company...and that one worked perfectly. I don't know if it is because of the design...but this one shuts off after about ten minutes of running. You have to constantly shake it to get it going again. Obviously a manufacturer error. I must say it is completely adorable and asthetically a complete pleasure to look at. My kids wanted me to keep it because it was that cute. But, it just didn't work	0
117443	I really love this magazine because it has parenting articiles in it!	1
294789	[...] I got a choice of a free subscription to either Parents or Child magazine. Since I already got Parents, I chose Child. I will not be renewing when my free subscription is up. The magazine is boring, the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages. If you want a magazine about parenting/kids, go with Parents.	0
B00019U4QA:great_vinyasa_yoga_video:robin_"arobinb"	This video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners.  I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home.  What a great choice.  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home.  I highly recommend this DVD	1

B000142Y2C:highly_recommended!:susanna_walker	Tweezerman Browmousse is a clear gel that you brush onto your eyebrows to hold them in place. I had tried other brands of styling gels for brows and was left very disappointed - they flaked and looked all stiff and gross.	1

B00007IT34:perfect_large_slicer_(cheap_too):jim_krupnik_"jkrupnik"	For big birds, rib roasts, etc., you need a long knife to get a clean even slice. This knife delivers. It has great lines, and a ballanced feel. The forged blade is thin and flexible, yet still drives from the handle. The blade follows your directions well, and doesn't wander during a cut. A real gem with top quality construction. I'm a big fan of three rivet durability, but these contemporary handles look and feel so good that I chose them for the last three knives I purchased. Blade for blade, these knives are the best around. At this price, you can build a lifetime set in months istead of years	1
B000B67FMY:horrible_product:d._e._cook	I would not recommend these hats. You definately get what you pay for. The sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed (even for a 6.00 hat.) I basically threw it out. The sad thing is, I spent as much in shipping as I did on the product	0
156960	This soundtrack was `heart-brokenly' disappointing to me mainly because it lacks a few songs that were in the film.  I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery.  Such a disappointment that wasn't included.	0
490449	The taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me.  Mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big.  When I first saw that I wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia.  Nope these are for everyone.  It is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate.  I cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time.  Share this with some friends.  Would be fun to have these for a party	1
B0007MUNQC:cheap_plastic_quality!_don't_even_bother!:jcanali_"jcanali"	This poker set is the cheapest quality there is.  For the price, I kind of expected a lesser quality product but not this bad!  The chips are plastic with a metal insert.  The chip edge is sharp and there are a lot of imperfections on the chip like dirt was mixed in it.  Furthermore, the thickness of the chips are UNEVEN.  Therefore, when you stack the chips (depending on the color), 5 white chips may be shorter than 5 black chips.  The poker case handle broke the first time I lifted it.  The chip dividers are loose and the felt material is not glued in properly.  This is really a bad product which should be banned from Amazon.	0

B0001T2L5M:versatile_and_yummy:a_home_cook	Passion fruit concentrate has become my favorite "secret ingredient"...I use it to make a citrus sauce for halibut steaks (water, sugar, cracked black peppercorns, honey, lemon and orange juice and zest, and passion fruit concentrate)--serve the fish on a bed of arugula, pour the sauce over, garnish with julienne strips of cucumber and slivered almonds, serve alongside jasmine rice, and your guests will feel they've landed in Hawaii...I also add it to Italian Cream Cake, replacing a couple of tablespoons of liquid ingredients with concentrate, and add it to the buttercream frosting as well in place of milk.  I've used this approach to make everything from a three-layer cake decorated with orchids to bite-size mini-cupcakes dusted with orange sugar.  My husband puts it in martinis with pineapple, and I mix it with Hypnotiq for a gorgeous aqua cocktail.  Everyone always wants to know what that exotic flavor is, but I only reveal the secret to my best friends..	1
B00023CWOC:weber_burners_replaced:lakeman_"lakeman"	Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell.	1
B0009ZHG44:i_enjoy_poser_6__a_lot!!!:dennis_a._amith_"entertainment_writer"	You will probably read 50/50 from the reviews on this software.  Having used the older Poser software... One thing I am a fan of is Miki and Terai Yuki...Japanese virtual beauties and if you are a fan of Japanese styled video games and the character designs, the fact that e-frontier is now the company behind Poser 6, I'm so stoked.	1
B00000DR9M:childhood_favorite:d._reagan_"sips_tea_in_the_afternoon"	I supposed I should not have been watching this movie when I was nine years old, but I remember seeing it several times via HBO. More importantly, my father bought the soundtrack and we used to listen to it over & over in the car. The songs stuck with me for years, and every know and then I'll hear something out of context and I'll be taken back to roadtrips with my family.  It's something that I won't think about for ages, but when I'm reminded of it, I can't believe I don't still have a copy of the soundtrack.	1
B000058DPM:not_useful_for_large-busts!!!:l._garcia_"expectant_1st_time_mommy"	I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women	0
461390	Purchased this machine for my wife (born 1949) who has high blood pressure (150+/90+ untreated) and Type-II diabetes. Had high hopes as this was not a drug-related therapy. But was vastly disappointed by lack of positive results. Yes, she enjoyed using it. But her blood pressure was not improved.	0

398422	American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her	0

524436	While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.	0
B000JBXXYK:scary:r._michael_oguin	Maggie Gyllenhaal played her part to perfection, scarily so.  She's the perfect sociopath, only thinking of herself while using her daughter, as well as anyone else she encounters, as a foil.  She's a master manipulator and feels no remorse for using anyone unlucky enough to cross her path.	1
B000FKGHFM:best_sunblock_around!:megan_"megs"	I am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because I constantly burn.  I have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied.  I went on my honeymoon to the Maldives in November and was able to stay out in the sun, go swimming and I did not have to constantly reapply.  I didn't get burned once!  Bull Frog Superblock is the best sunblock around	1
B000054OTW:better_than_given_credit_for:k._leifsen_"anubis"	I feel some of the other reviews here are unjust and over exagerated. There were two places in the film that in total lasted maybe about five minutes where the sound was distorted, but not badly since you could still understand the characters clearly (ex. one area had a warpy vhs noise and the second had a bit of low static). The costumes were well selected, but I felt a better job could have been done on the rats and the lizard (you can see a gap where the costume ends on his face). This version follows the book well, though it left out a favorite qoute about the taste of the liquid in the first scene that she drinks from the "drink me" bottle. I also felt that the British accents in the movie enhanced the film. I recomend this to fans and people who aren't overly critical of films	1
B000H2XXKA:an_acceptable_meal_replacement:s._poynter_"healthmama"	For flavor, I could give these cookies a "5", but the health aspects demand that they only rate a "4".  All told, they taste great and are the best on the go lunch I have found for hubby (he often eats on the run).  The price is right and it keeps him from cruising though the nearest drive though	1
256835	Well, I just wanted to say that I am purchasing this to learn more about what could be, my ancestor!  Yup!  My name is Jackie Kidd.  I have been forever interested in anything that has to do with Captain Kidd.  Get this, we all have nicknames at my job and I am called:  Captain Kidd.  People think I'm wacked, but I don't care.	1

B000GLK6RK:buy_several_flashlights_and_leave_them_where_you_need_them!:wacac_"wacac"	This looks like a good idea from Westinghouse, but if you read the warranty details, the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10-year warranty.  $10.00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years - but not really?  What is the point?  Extra tape isn't even included when the first strip fails.	0
420217	Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!	0
B00004SBJ4:they_rust!__big_disappointment...:m._seddon_"green_thumb"	I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.  Only problem is that they RUST!!!  I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.	0

B000A7I7W6:go_with_the_deluxe_version,_don't_waste_your_time_on_the_elite:1stopsurplus	The snap on the Leapers "Elite" Drop Leg Holster (the term Elite must be used loosely) would never stay attached. It would always either unsnap or come loose at the back. Eventually it fell off in the field and I lost it. The straps would never stay securely in the place I positioned them.	0

B00006RH5I:low_price.._high_enjoyment:jorge_guillermo_calderon_"joguic"	I think is a "must" for any beginner, for a low price you can have almost all the different size of EP. Try them for a few months and then when you will be completely sure what do you want and buy the EP that you need.	1
B0001KO9SI:great_machine_:coolzaz_"mrac69"	I was going to buy The Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker, because the price was so good , but I waited over three months because it was not in stock so I looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price, but after using it, it's more than twice the machine I think , on the Amazon description it says the pump is a 16-bar pump , But after checking reviews on different web sites I think Amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites ,it says the a pump  to be 17.5 bar pump, that's even better , And the other thing that I like, was the fact that it had a CD , that was not said on the description either , I never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful , shows and explains the basics, from making espresso two frothing the milk ,cleaning tips and more very helpful .	1
201656	Metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. Most of their trite albums deserve no stars. Their only good cds are either Master of Puppets, or Black Album. KILL EM ALL is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! James Hetfield, the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why???? Why can't he sing more proper like Lou Greamm(Foreigner), & Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)????????	0

0792846400:read_the_book_-_it_takes_less_time!:jr_pinto	The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film	0
142580	When I first started reading this magazine back in 2003 I thought "Oooh what a cool mag!!" But clearly I was totally wrong. Since 2003 Seventeen has changed  from a girly sophisticated mag appealing to girls just barely in their teens to to a cheap,overated, cliche`, piece of crap!!! I'd like to know what happened!!!!! It's super boring now. It has no style. All the sections are about health garbage & boring global trash. HELLO? What about the stars, movies,.. the music section sucks! Nothing is good anymore! If you disagree with me your probably just as boring as it yourself. I hate it and I DO NOT recomend this magazine. Don't read it!! You'll be wasting your time	0

B000056HMB:must_have!!!:finally_a_mommy_"vn"	This is one of my favorite products I have purchased as a new mommy.  I love it.  It warms the Avent bottles great.  It took some trials to determine how much water to add but now I have it down great.  You can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful.  It is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water. It DOES NOT warm the Playtex Ventair bottles.  I guess because of the vent but I preferred the Avent bottles anyway.  The cooler DOES keep bottles cold for up to 8 hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day.  We have a 2 story house and this helped us so much.  I have the other First year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well.  This is definitly worth the money	1
38794	...But I'm giving season four 4 stars, because there aren't any subtitles in this set. They also didn't have subtitles for season 3, but they did had subtitles for seasons 1 & 2. Strange, huh? However, the quality of the DVDs are fine and the episodes, of course, are wonderful to watch. At the end of this season the Meathead is supposed to graduate and move out for good, but he decides to stay with the Bunkers a little longer, so he can get his Masters degree.	1

B0006624M0:curiosity__mystery:d._wicklund	I do not usually take the time to write reviews on products. If I am not satisfied with something I would return it and write a reason for the return. The kids used this product up in about an hour so there wasn't much to send back. When I was a kid we had spirograph and it was a great thing. The reviews for the current model said that spirograph was just a memory and the new one was a cheap copy that didn't work. I am glad that the reviews were there for that product. To save money I ordered this low cost Spin Doodles toy. Five year old kids are always excited to open a toy to check it out. I played with them for a little while to get them started and realized that we had a box of junk. Why would someone go through the trouble to develope and manufacture a toy and then sell it on the internet when it is not really usable ? The gears and holder for the paper were a mess of poorly designed and warped plastic. At least the cost was low. This one was a waste of shipping cost even if the toy was free. I hope this helps someone who remembers spirograph and what a great creative toy it was 35 to 40 years ago. I guess the technology has been lost for toys with plastic gears.	0

B0001WAO9O:works_good:jack_and_violet's_momma	I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before. Needless to say fabric doesn't protect leather very well. I ended up with deep depressions in the leather. Hopefully the leather will go back (fingers crossed). The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.	1
128289	I had two unworking disks (One a PS2 game and the other a PSX game) so I picked this up and both work fine now! The only thing is you'll have to run it through a couple times.

89780	I was at the Brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson, Perla Batalla's "Bird on a Wire", Rufus' "Chelsea Hotel"  and (from the Sydney concert) Antony's  "If it be your Will". Two major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band for Leonard Cohen's own version of "Tower of Song" seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work,  and the nonsensical ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on "Alexandra Leaving". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release	1

287887	Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it.	0

B000066P6R:great_watch:delta_pilot	I first got one of these when it was issued to me in the Air Force back in the early 1990's.  As a fighter pilot (former) I've busted more watches in cockpits than most but this one held up.  Now that I'm in the more sedate confines of an airline cockpit, I still wear it.  It has dual time zones and an alarm, perfect for international travel.  Beware, it's a BIG watch!  If that's not your style, you may want to see one in person before you buy.  The only drawback... the plastic/rubber band will crack after 2+ years and need replacement.  I put a nice leather band on mine and even had a passenger compliment me on my "Breitling".  When I told him it was a Casio and cost $4950 less, he wanted one too.	1

B0002AHQT6:watch_the_part_number:camera_user	I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a "clone" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know	0

B00021BJH0:get_easy_beach_waves!:pulp_fiction	I have thick in-between wavy and straight hair that is also dry and frizzy. Other curl enhancing lotions I have tried have made my hair feel crunchy, hard and sticky, yuck! Not this one. After I wash and condition my hair I apply this spray to almost dry hair, scrunch it and let it air dry. It gives my otherwise limp, frizzy waves definition, lift and bounce. It even adds shine and smells great, sort of like watermelon. It also looks more natural and is much easier than having to use a curling iron. The spray is easy to use and you can't really use too much of it, which is a problem I've had with other products. In between washes I just spray my hair with water and scrunch it to reactivate the waves.	1
B000069EXN:ali's_mommy:first_time_mom_in_georgia	I love this sack.  And highly recommend it especially if your child likes to kick the blankets up over their heads.  Before I purchased this I found her sleeping with the coveres over her head twice!!!	1

B00020Q700:my_favorite_"cover":gregory_shrout	This boonie hat is collapsible, yet has a firm rim. Chin-strap is attached to keep it where it belongs in high winds.

B000AMON38:motorola_i560_vs_i710:t._snelling	The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model.	1

379403	Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice	1
B000H3D3YA:great_foundation:nicole_martinez	I am one of the people who just doesn't like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well, but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation.

B000FB947O:great_shoes!_buy_them.:brian_raisler	These Crocs are very unique. They have a comfortable footbed that cradles your foot. They are shaped like a Birkenstock, but with closed cell foam instead of cork as the footbed. The closed cell foam is very lightweight but dense so you can walk around in comfort. I wear them just about everyday to work. I chose the closed toe model without the holes in the top because I work in a laboratory where having your feet exposed is not a good idea. The ones with open holes in the top offer more ventilation. And, because Crocs float in water, they make great shoes for boating or kayaking. They drain well and dry out quickly, plus if you do manage to slip one off it will bob along on the surface until you fetch it.	1

260596	I love Judith Mcnaught's work.  Her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings.  In my opinion all of her historicals are winners.  SOME of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to name a few.  There are other contemporary flops though (Remember When, Triumphant Heart, etc).  Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment.  The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again.  It was really forced.	0
92198	I've been a GTA fan for a few years now and to me, San Andreas has got to be the best one. For the first time you can swim!! I fell into the water accidently and discovered this new action for the character. The graphics are more real making it kind of "funky" controlling the game but after awhile you'll get used to it. The language is terrible (more so in this GTA version) so young kids should avoid this like the plague.	1
B00006RVNC:substantial_construction,_long_cable:rusty_child	This cable was just what I needed to connect my stereo to my computer's sound card across the room.

461305	I am a huge fan of this series.  When I found out they were releasing all the games for XP I was extremely happy.  However, King's Quest 7 has a problem in chapter 5 with the firecracker exploding when it is picked up causing an endless loop and forcing you to restart the entire game.  This was only a problem on XP with the previous game and I expected it to be fixed on this release.  However, when I got to that point in the game I picked up the firecracker AND IT EXPLODED RIGHT AWAY.  I could not believe this.  The whole point of this release was to port the games to XP and they didn't even do that properly.  This was a known problem and they didn't even fix it.  This makes me extremely catious of buying anything from Vivendi in the future	1

20422	They spend the first half of this movie saying how great the Ultimate Warrior was.  The journey is awesome!  Then all of the sudden, the paid WWE guys just began to bad-mouth the Warrior. Maybe he did have questionable judgment - but why are they trying to make us feel bad about someone we loved?  They take some very low blows. They say that the Warrior was a bad wrestler. Actually he seemed just fine to me when I was young, and I really can't distinguish one's ability from the other. They just all gang up on him and make outragious allegations. Vince says quickly that the reason why the Ultimate disappeared for 3 years was because he failed a drug test. As soon as he says this, they fade to black then come back with a new issue. What drug use? Which drugs? Presumably they're talking about steroids. But what about that high and mighty Hulk Hogan with his admitted drug use. Let's not talk about that - let's just keep ganging up on the Warrior. They completely ridicule him changing his name to the Warrior. And they also just try to badmouth him so much. Who cares that none of the wrestlers liked him? I don't! He excited the heck out of me way more than any of the dorks who say bad things about him -including Hulk. And oh yeah - they don't even let the Warrior defend himself.  Why did I have to find out from IMDB.com that he was asked to appear but declined? Why don't they address this?  This "docu" is more slanted than "Fahrenheitt 911" Every wrestling and Ultimate Warrior fan will start out loving this docu then hating it. It just leaves you with a bitter taste in your mouth, tired of all of the whining and bitter trash talking.	0

0802135269:dull:plaku_"plaku"	I wanted to like this book, but I had to give up in the end. If the overall vignette concept is attractive enough, the execution of detail isn't -- Kosinski can't write. He tries and eventually fails to convey what he deems important, whereas the reader is always expected to discover "depth" in simplicity. Nothing to be recommended for	0

63562	I am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material, 'Wired' is even too tedious to fill that need. Its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled National Geographics of questionable scientific value. On the other hand the articles, for example in the latest issue, 'Are Higher Gas Prices Good for Us'(paraphrase of title) offer little information and if I had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of 1970 Nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced Operation Independance. The intention at the time was to free the U.S. from dependance on foriegn oil.	0

B000G27F14:avoid_this_product:frank_"awesomefx"	I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY	0

B0006U67G0:sturdy,_stable,_easy,_and_it_works!:profe_"returning_to_the_creator"	We researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model. This is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table. The ankles are comfy and secure. The DVD shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right. As you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design. The best part is using it. It feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas. I can't wait to use it again. We love it.	1

B000KMHVW8:my_favorite_episode:j._donaldson_"cal-diver"	I don't have television, haven't for 11 years. When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI, CSI NY, CSI Miami, and NCIS. I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far. I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS. So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.	1

B0000046KI:a_not-so-good_album._why?_read_this..._:jose_mario_serra	Despite all reviews posted here in this page are given 5-stars to this release, I need to be honest and explain why I am giving just one poor star. No, I am not crazy. Let me explain my point-of-view, and after that you can decide if this JH album really deserves more stars. Just to start, this album does not have a spinal-column that could guide the band(?) or the musicians thru a solid path. There are tracks played by a duo, trio, 4tt, and sometimes a very loose quintet, and each of these tracks have a different mood, without any presence of a jazz soul, or even a real smell of jazz. Maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage/tribute to Mr Strayhorn, or maybe a recognition for Mr Henderson value in the 20th century Jazz History as one of the most important hard-boppers ever. But the result was very poor. If you really love Joe Henderson (as I appreciate), try any of his albums from the 60's (as a band-leader or as a sideman), mainly those from the Blue Note era. In time: I gave one star, in memory of his brilliant carreer. This particular album deserve zero-star.	0

B00006AN0L:playmobil_is_great!:a_smart_mom_"mmom"	We bought our youngest son the pirate ship seven years ago when he was four. He is now eleven, and is asking for this new updated ship. He has played with the old one for years, outside in the pool, inside, along with the big king castle, and countless other sets that we have. Yes, Playmobil. is delicate, and young children can be taught how to play with it, there are alot of small pieces, but like Lego, it will and does encourage a child's imagination, rather than stifle it.  We have Castles, western forts, city sets, boats, all of it! It does take time to put together, but some of the best memories are of me and my boys putting together some of these intricate playmobil sets the day after Christmas! When you buy toys for your kids, don't look at a toy and say "what does it do", rather look at a toy and ask "what can my child do with this toy"? Playmobil has been one of the toys that my three boys have stayed with along with legos well past Christmas, much more, than anything else. I am keeping all of our collections for our grandchildren.	1

B00065L5W6:not_happy_with_this_machine:whool11_"c"	Christmas morning and the slow, ongoing leak, which we worked around over the last year, finally gave way and voila! hot coffee and water and grounds all over the counter and floors. And yes, we clean our coffeemaker daily, and yes, we know how to properly run the thing too. (We gave up on the water filter soon after purchase--it kept falling into the coffee grounds.) Why the two stars? We wanted to love this machine! We wanted it to work! It is a handsome machine with a handsome pedigree (a Mr. Coffee!). The clock is nice. The thermal carafe is lovely. Until the BIG LEAK, we made do with its daily dribble and sputter. But really, after examining the unit carefully before its trip to the trash can, we realized how foolish we were in keeping this fire hazard going as long as we did. That's why I've bothered to write this review. It is not an inexpensive machine; the quality isn't there. Sorry.	0

I have tried other brands--drugstore varieties as well as department store varieties and have been disappointed with everything else I have ever tried.  Why?  This mascara is smooth; it does not flake off and fall into your eyes.  It does not ever look clumpy.  It is also easy to remove without losing any eyelashes.  I would not say that this mascara will make your lashes "a mile long" or "dangerously thick" or whatever hype you hear from other brands.  Those kinds only ever look like clumpy mascara.  Just a simple nice, natural looking mascara that won't irritate your eyes	1

1556525362:first-hand_experience:james_r._taylor	I worked with the author in the Narcotics Section of the Chicago Police Department.  Please do not let the author's perception of the truth sway your opinion about the Chicago Police Department and the men and women who serve proudly.  The author claims that the Narcotics Section and its policies were a leading contributor to his decline.  I think not.  He thrived on these practices and used them to his advantage.  All we saw was a selfish and immature young man who thought of himself first.  If the author thinks that only the Commander of the Narcotics Section was disgusted with his drug usage and failing his urinalysis, he is dead wrong.  We all were.  If you read this book, please do not indict all of us because of one person's jaded stories.	0

0441008577:a_new_spin_on_a_time-honored_genre:andrew_salmon	Alien invasion stories have been done to death since H.G. Wells gave us The War Of The Worlds so it is extraordinarily difficult to come with a new slant to this time-honored genre. Well, William C. Dietz pulls it off with Death Day and the concluding volume Earth Rise. What sets Death Day apart from most of the invasion tradition is, first of all, the invading force being made up of different races. This makes an interesting dynamic and gives the enemy character as their squabbles, in-fighting and fight for freedom (some are slaves to others) make for something new, different and engaging. Also, using racism amonst the aliens as well as the surviving human population rings a true, and tragic, note. The surviving pockets of humanity withdraw within themselves, close off their borders and horde resources. The aliens favor people of color and place them as overseers as human slaves are forced to work building alien temples on Earth. And, sadly, collaborators work with the invading force to control the humans. But the seeds of rebellion have been planted. Humans and enslaved aliens are fighting back and this first book sets up an alliance between the enslaved races. All this is interesting stuff and makes for a fresh approach. I enjoyed this book and recommend it highly. Dietz is the best SF writer working today when it comes to letting character drive the story no matter the setting.	1

I decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate, and it never gave the same reading twice.  First it was 95.5 and then 98.5 and then 96.2, etc.  I tested it on myself, my daughter and my husband.  Then I gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe I just wasn't doing it correctly and he had the same results.  I have taken it back to Target and am trying a different brand.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT	0

389927	This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama.	1

I am in my 30's, have fair/medium shade combination skin.  I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing.  I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin).  I tried it for several weeks.  No results.  This product did nothing for me.  I would not recommend it.  I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.	0

B0002T2YTE:wonderful,_portable_little_storage_bucket:frisky2000_"frisky2000"	With the birth of our first child, there were tons of little toys lying around all the time, from teethers to rattles, stuffed lovies and blocks.  The traditional toy box was too bulky for our small living space, so when someone gave us this adorable tote we were thrilled to see how much fit inside, how sturdy it was, and how much our baby loved looking at it!   With bold primary colors and cute scenes surrounding the entire bin, there is even a fold out flap with a play space, and a singing bird which attaches to the side basket.  The fun roof is all made of satin ribbons that resemble "shingles."  This was easily stored in our closet or taken along on trips.   Best of all, there seems to be no end to how much you can stuff inside!  It is soft and collapsible, yet stands upright and will hold just about all your small baby toys.  It can be VERY GENTLY machine washed, but we discovered it was best not to throw it in with anything heavy.  I gave one to a neighbor when her son was born and she still raves about how perfect it was for their baby's toys.  I give this 5 stars without hesitation; affordable and totally functional	1

They have a light, crisp texture but they are not crunchy and they absorb moisture immediately.  Although 8 ounces doesn't sound like much, you really get a very generous quantity of these lighter-than-air strawberries.  I recommend this item highly	1

This CD is as consistant as all his others. Great lyics and superb musicianship. I rate this five stars as I believe Gill is one of the best singer songwriters in the world today	1
184267	Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it	1

465362	When Disney Interactive released &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,&quot; in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. &quot;Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&quot; &quot;I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&quot; If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves.

0712666451:wwi_textbook:monty_rainey	Though only a fraction of books have been written about the Great War when compared to WWII, there are some great ones to pick from. For instance, for a great narrative of the American involvement in World War I, try The Doughboys by Gary Mead. For a good look at the events of Gallipoli, just last year John Laffin wrote The Agony of Gallipoli, which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare. There is a great book which chronicles Verdun called The Price of Glory by Alistair Horne. The list goes on and on, whether it be Flanders, the Somme, Passchendaele, Africa, Jutland, whatever your area of interest might be. The point I'm making is, there are plenty of specialized accounts of World War I, and even several overviews of the war, but John Keegan's THE FIRST WORLD WAR, is a great source for an overall study of the war.	1

B00005CF9Y:the_movie_may_be_good,_but_the_music_is_sucky:mrs._rosie_skywalker	This is the perfect CD for taking a nap to. It's mostly full of slow pop and rock. If you're a fan of this type of music, I recommend this CD, but if not, don't buy it. There are only a few good tracks. All Star, Bad Reputation, I'm A Believer, Stay Home. And I don't enjoy buying a CD that only 1/3 of it is good. So, I wouldn't buy it, if I were you.	0

6304139845:hans_christian_andersen:geoffrey_berman	My almost 3 year old loves it.  She doesn't understand a lot of it and some of the scenes are a bit 'mean spirited' but she's been able to overlook them.  She and I love the music together.  That's why I bought it in the first place	1
B000C40LJO:nice_idea,_but_doesn't_work:p._scoville	This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.	0

448789	I've read other personal finance magazines before and found them to be either too basic to be worth my time, or too focused on some obscure area.  I'm not a financial professional, but I like to constantly increase my knowledge of personal finance.  Kiplinger's has been great for that.  I skip 80% of the articles in this magazine, but that still leaves one or two in every issue that teach me about an area I didn't know about -- where to buy bonds online the most cheaply, how to find good financial advice, why options are priced the way they are.  One good article pays for the entire annual subscription.  Each issue has a wide range of articles appealing to lots of levels of experience	1

This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable.

I initially considered the WRT300N model, but the reviews were mediocre.  So I went instead for this newer model, hoping that Linksys has fixed the bugs and addressed the problems identified with the WRT300N model.  I am sorry to say that all the bad reviews on the WRT300N also apply to this model.  I am returning it after 5 hours of use.	0

The second I put my daughter on it she nearly fell into the toilet! The seat is not very stable and as far as being able to go on most toilets, that is a lie. My toilet seat is as regular as they come and it still falls through. A waste of money and a safety hazard	0
B000EF3E4A:these_sardines_are_delicious!:a._bennett	I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all	1
B00005MKKH:a_midlander's_review:cowboy_on_the_ocean	Being from Midland you might say I'm a homer and thus have a bias towards this movie.  This movie was literally made at the very end of the oil boom period - in fact many of the companies' whose name appear through out the movie had gone out of business by the time it was released (that's how fast the bust hit).  Terry Jastrow (who is from Midland) and his real life wife Anne Archer are great opposite each other on the screen while Mary Kay Place provides great commentary on life in Texas Oil Business	1

60779	Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the "reviews" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the "secrets" of such and such product. A "secret" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product	0
B00077AA3S:works_great!:ajfjc	I've had this wireles temperature station for about 2 months now and I'm very happy with it.  I mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight (direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings).  The "base" station is usually in our kitchen, but for a while I moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room - the outdoor sensor never "lost contact" with the base.  The indoor temp reading is accurate and is within 1-2 degrees of 2 thermostats I have in the house, and the outdoor temp is accurate with 1-2 degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch.  I enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning.	1
B00029TCRQ:excellent_product_at_an_affordable_price!:d.h._messer	I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews, in that they claim this piece is flimsy. It is NOT at all flimsy, nor does it look cheap. In fact, my husband and I have the entire set (changing table and dresser), along with the Montery Crib.  When you receive the boxes, there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer, not the store, will handle all returns, exchanges, or shipping of missing parts. Well, we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect. We spoke with Storkcraft directly, and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly. Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant, and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY, and they would arrange for a prompt exchange.  This piece looks beautiful, and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser. I am sure that you could spend $1,000 on a high-end piece, but if you are looking for something that is 1) AFFORDABLE, and 2) WELL-MADE, and 3) BEAUTIFUL, then Storkcraft is a good choice	1
B000AN1YES:delcious!:lin_shieh_"boba_tea_direct"	This Matcha Green Tea Powder is delicious!  It does come slightly pre-sweetened, so people who do not wish to consume any sugar may need to be aware.

I used this powder to make a Green Tea Smoothie Frappe and it tasted great.  Highly recommend	1

Some of the songs I like a lot, and some I don't, but they're all a challenge and fun in some way.  I like to use the Dance Master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well.  I haven't made it all that far because I play the same levels over and over again because they're so fun.  This game is great for people of all ages, and includes music for the young and old.	1

B000H1ZJ4Y:family_tree_maker_version_16_collector's_edition:r._gloss	Excellent product.  The 'over $450 value' might be a bit overstated but the packages is still an excellent value.  During installation, the 1 year free trial to [...] showed up as a 30 day trial but was resolved quickly through familytreemaker.com support and a subsequent call to ancestry.com support.  Ancestry.com provided a 1 year free trial to their US Deluxe product over the phone and didn't ask for a credit card number for renewal.  To me, that's a sign that they're a reputable company.  Some of the additional software in the package is buried on the installation CD but is worth the extra manual effort to find and install - especially the GenSmart software.	1

I've used all of the sonic toothbrushs on the market and Braun Sonic Complete is by far the best.

You are probably better more with one of the other two models of Vitality that uses rotational brush heads	0
176709	Whenever people hear of Sofia Coppola they think of 2 things: her much-maligned performance in Godfather III, and her famous dad Francis Ford Coppola, director of the Godfather films and Apocalpyse Now. The latter is particular fodder for nepotism remarks, although it's not as if her dad has made some stellar movies lately. "Jack" anyone? Well this film and her next film Lost in Translation should tip the scale on her favor as she's quite perfect for this kind of material.	1

204260	I previously left a very positive review of the shampoo and conditioner, however, after using it for several days, my hair feels heavy, dirty and coated with something.  I know Jonathan loves his product "Dirt" but it does not belong in a volumizing product for women with fine, limp hair.  I don't need anything else to weight my hair down.  It does not feel clean after washing and drying it.  I am quite disappointed as I really loved the way both products smelled. I had to wash my hair a second time today because it would not do what I wanted it to do and it felt like the "second day" after washing it. I still recommend the volumizing foam.  That is a nice product.  Smells wonderful and does not weight your hair down or cause it to become full of static as products with a lot of alcohol do.	0

216534	I am leading a Christian study group using popular films.  I was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some Scriptural truth.

B0000009KM:another_strong_effort:zub_"zubenelgenubi"	Ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl-led group sounds.  This time, there are six tunes that did not make it into the top 100 and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire, this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there.  With enough (ten) top-10 songs to keep the music familiar, there are lots of seldom-found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp.  Between such monster hits as Lesley Gore's pre-womens' rights anthem &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot;, the Exciters go-and-get-him &quot;Tell Him&quot; and Kathy Young's barely pubescent &quot;A Thousand Stars&quot; are cradled such rarities as the Secrets' &quot;The Boy Next Door&quot; (a Madara-White, of &quot;You Don't Own Me&quot; and other Gore tunes fame, composition ), April Stevens' &quot;Teach Me Tiger&quot; (later with brother Nino Tempo striking it big with &quot;Deep Purple&quot;) and Timi Yuro's (of &quot;Hurt&quot; fame) &quot;What's A Matter Baby&quot;.  In this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track 10 is of substandard sound quality even so.  Many of the tracks (2,3,6,8,12-15,17,23,25,28) appear in stereo, the remainder in mono.  The 16-page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented.

B0006SDRRE:market_spice_tea:n._forgey	We have enjoyed Market Spice Tea since our first taste at a local Las Vegas coffee house. When the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we didn't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to Seattle on vacation. The tea is delicious, ordering it on Amazon was easy, the delivery was fast and we all had it for Christmas	1
0316626449:my_favorite_book:joe_minnock	I am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well.  I read this book about ten years ago and I read it regularly every couple of years.  The story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run-down community is a classic of American literature.	1
B00000FZKA:a_charming,_clever_british_comedy:joe_sixpack_--__slipcue.com	Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	1
600616	During the 1960's, when my sister subscribed to AHMM, the stories mirrored the fantastic television show; the stories were primarily mysterious, creepy, and unique, with lots of murders and the twist endings that made the show so great.  Now, the majority of the stories in the magazine are plain, uninteresting "detective" stories.  I subscribed up until about the early 1980's, but stopped because of the same old boring "cops and robbers" material.  I tried to read a recent copy while waiting for my aunt at the beauty shop, but switched to one of the media rags instead when discovered that AHMM hadn't changed. Subscribe only if you are a fan of pure "police" fiction	0

This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect.  Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker.  My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't!  It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on.  I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!	1
B000FTLSR0:a_great_slr_camera_for_non-professional:james_c._hill_"traveler"	Have had the camera a short time and have grown to love its features and capabilities. Do purchase the 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens; for the price it is a nice lens.  I tried the image stabilizer by shooting a picture of the air conditioner on my neighbor's roof using 200 mm telephoto.  When you enlarge the image you can read the label for the brand name!  Without the image stabilizer, it is a blur.  I did the same for a book about 100 ft away and using 200 mm setting. Without image stabilizer the title is blurred; with the image stabilizer it is sharp. A very nice feature is you can take an image and then enlarge a portion of it and save, or use filters to make them BW, soft, more bright, or with different color tones.	1

Very stimulating for the young ones	1
b000biu1x2:summertime_is_fun!:b._k._mccartney	We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio	1

Like all these bars you do get sick of the same flavor day after day. I recommend alternating between these and another bar that's not so sweet (kashi trail mix bars are perfect).

B000M23P3U:great_phone_except_for_the_time_display:carleton_j._macdonald_"carletonm"	I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier	1

B000C3U9L0:doesn't_stay_on,_not_accurate:naw002	This pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking.  Those are the only good things I can say about it.  It simply does not stay on.  I, too, have had to use a safety pin to make sure I don't lose it.  Maybe I have a defective device, but this is anything but accurate.  I consistently walk a measured 5 mile route every day.  One day the steps will be 5800, the next day 12800, the next day 10300.  Which is accurate?  Are any of them?  I can't rely on it.  When testing the device for accuracy in walking 50 steps, it never got it right.  Most of the time it was over the 50 steps, 2 times it was way under the 50 steps.  I would not recommend this one	0

B0000630L2:constant_derailments_-_better_off_with_brio:r._carter_nicholas_"rcnick4"	It's Christmas Day, and believe me, the only thing that would get me to sit down at a computer is the level of dissatisfaction I've had with the Thomas battery powered engines.  These trains derail constantly.  I think it is because all four wheels have power, and the front wheels have too much traction, so they are able to climb out of the grooves.  Took me all night to set up a really cool track, and they derail every 40 seconds or so.  Read: 3 year old yelling at train.  Thank goodness I also bought a Brio battery powered engine as well (the Polar Express one).  It works much better.  It has not derailed once all morning.  It also is better in the following ways: 1) It shuts off after 2 minutes so you don't lose battery power, 2) it can go into freewheel mode when you want to use it without power, 3) it goes in reverse, 4) it makes train sounds, 5) the coupling to other cars has a swivel which means it is less likely to derail and more likely to maintain the magnetic connection, 6) it comes with batteries installed.  If "Santa Claus" had not disposed of all the packaging last night, I would return all the battery operated Thomas Trains and go with Brio ones.  Note: there is a good thomas battery powered car which is the jet engine.  This jet engine has the swivel, and seems not to derail, maybe because it pushes the other cars in front of it	0

B000K0X90I:perfect_companion.:maciek_niedorezo_"mngraphix"	Srudy phone during all scenarios. MP3 player is great, no compatibility problems. The software supplied lets you replace your PDA with this phone. The camera is more than decent, (much like the 1.0-2.0 megapixel cybershot cameras of the nat so recent past) No problems what so ever, the design is rather smart and simple, without the lack of elegance. The flip-phone factor lets you talk comfortably, and safely with the antena safely away form your brain. The surface is a curious texture that seems to prevent any scratches. Tiny design details that make it a Sony product. AMAZING battery life, surprising for an MP3 phone	1

I'll definitely buy this product, and I'll be recommending it to my mom, whose feet are drier than mine are	1
B0007WX1IO:favorite_birthday_toy:mom_of_2_princesses	We just got this for my daughter's 5th Birthday. This toy was what received the greatest excitement. While opening presents, my daughter exclaimed at the the top of her lungs, "I got a Brietta Pegasus!" The pegasus itself is durable, beautiful, and creatively sparks hours of imaginitave play. I didn't think it was a big deal trying to get it out of the box. Many toys are packaged that way these days... Perhaps an anti-theft plan. I just got some scissors and Brietta was out to play. So far we also haven't had any trouble with the wings. If they do fall out occasionally- they pop right back in. A small price to pay for such a well-loved toy that my 5 year old plays with for hours. As a mom who also loved unicorns and Pegasus ponies as a girl, I'm glad I can give that magic to my own girls	1

6302191114:watchable...:l._varnau_"nerff20"	Albert Pyun is my absolute least favorite director. I hate his guts. His direction ruined &quot;Cyborg&quot; and was murky in &quot;Omega Doom.&quot; This is his best flick, and it's not that good. In fact, it pales in comparison to the so-so original. Sasha Mitchell is highly entertaining in this sequel that is certainly watchable, but highly forgettable. The villain from the first, Tong Po, has returned after killing the Sloan brothers from the first movie. Now, he's out to redeem his honor by fighting little brother David Sloan. Standard martial arts fare. Some choppy fight scenes, but an interesting main character saves this picture from otherwise becoming complete dreck	0
B000MRA3NU:innovation_is_not_always_a_good_thing:jo_ann_larkin_"happygolarkin"	This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them	0
B000065U36:watch_it_for_jack_black:h._s._anand	Orange County as a movie tries to play it safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing. Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also plays Black's brother in the film.	1
B0007LA9EE:great_bang_for_the_buck..._but_lacks_a_few_essentials:joe_crescenzi_"a_regular_joe"	First off... I like this unit.  It's EASY to use, and it does a fine job of taking your old LPs and making CDs out of them.  All you need to do is place a blank AUDIO CD into the deck (it doesn't work with regular data CDs), hit the phono/aux button, followed by the record button and then after you place the needle on the LP... take it out of pause.  It starts recording instantly.  Between each song, hit a button and it break the recording into tracks.  Pretty cool!	1

417053	This book still does not address many areas I find interesting in James Brown's career but I find it a natural companion to the three other JB books in my collection: Cynthia Rose's "Living In America: The Soul Saga Of James Brown"; Geoff Brown's biography "James Brown"; and ofcourse, the Brown/Tucker "The Godfather Of Soul - James Brown". All three dig deep into this metaphysical musician's mind but this one has a stronger narrative, a bit less guarded: his late '80s fall is described in a more contrite way, for example. His scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue - but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men, then immediately moves on to the next thought. Even by 2005 standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality, obviously directed at the female fans, ever recorded. Similarly, his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap/hip-hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self-righteous: there is alot of "adult" content in his catalogue which can't be explained away as "art". However, fans can trace his development into more "cerebral" music, with more and more sensitive ballads and socially-conscious tunes being produced  from the late '60s on.	1

B00006IUU7:poor_quality:elizabeth_leaird	The pitcher is made from poor quality materials. We have two pitchers and have never washed them in the dishwasher. In less than a year, both pitchers cracked along the seam that runs from the spout down the side of the pitcher. If we attempt to use them, tea immediately leaks all over the counter. Since other pitchers are not compatible with the machine, our ice tea maker is useless. We have owned two previous Mr. Coffee Ice Tea models in the past ten years. The pitchers lasted for several years before eventually cracking. Mr. Coffee chose to use inferior materials with this model. I am very disappointed in the quality and will never trust their company again. I am now searching for an ice tea maker that uses quality materials	0
B0000VCZN4:enjoyable_and_fun!:marc_dalesandro	I was skeptical when I first heard they were making a "Freddy vs Jason" movie. The chances of getting it totally wrong seemed quite high.

The plot makes a twisted kind of sense, the performances by Robert Englund and Ken Kirzinger are inspired and enthusiastic, and the special effects are top-notch.	1

6304208219:jet_li__or_jackie_jan_fighting?:carlos_v._orraca_"matrixvsmorpheus12"	This Jet Li movie is thus far the best movie since Shaolin Temple as Younger Jet Li. Its awesome surreal fighting creates this Epic feel to the whole Genre of martial arts fighting. Jet Li has never been so swift and so passionate in this movie. It has laughter, suspense, compassion, and innocense. The most spectacular scene is the dual fights with his son doing foot to shoulder cambat against the Witches pawn. This film is highly recommended to those who love Jet Li and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. An Excellent movie to add to the Jet Li collection	1

B00009OWJT:a_'difficult'_movie;_unfortunately,_it_ain't_very_good_either:dave_"missing_person"	It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, "Foxes" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation	0

594053	This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure.  Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them, but I am not one of them.  The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well, but the plot to the campaign messes it all up.  The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun.  I was disappointed in the new campaign.  I'd say the first one is better.  If you make a big deal about graphics though, than this game is for you.  It has excellent graphics and features.  The ocean and mountain looks so realistic.  They do a good job showing you underwater.  These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series.  If you were expecting a good campaign, your not going to be very happy.  Plot isnt so good and its very short.  It has about half of the other games campaigns.  A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out.  They're kind of annoying.  Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal.	1

I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South	1

I think the best El Yucateco I've tried was the Chipotle one, which sadly is not included. Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor	1
B00009V2WN:ge_corded_slimline_phone:the_guy_family	It's a good phone, works well. I like the Caller ID & Function buttons being a different color than from the rest of the phone, makes them easier to see & use. It has good sound & a ring tone that doesn't jangle the nerves.	1
B000EN5H9M:baby_buki_is_best:e._b._kramer	I just bought this the other day having owned the regular sized Kabuki brush.  I find I like the Baby Buki better, it still gives great coverage just in a more compact size which I love	1
1588462595:my_mouth_is_still_hanging_open_in_awe:andrew_w._vertrees_"shawna"	This book rocks!  Every writer on this project knows how to create an image of the Invictus.  Its just like I imagined it but better.  The Blood Oaths are incredible and will add so much to my game.  The subtlties of dress as outlined in the beginning of the story are already a part of my elysium and the book came out a scant week ago.  This book will make your chronicle rock if the invictus are your antagonists they will be much better for you having read this if they are the majority of your PC's (Like in my game)  Get it now and tell your players to do the same.  This is a must have for anyone who really wants to portray the byzantine politics of the Requiem	1

B000A6X9CK:for_the_price...this_is_a_good_buy:s._close	I bought this straightner at Walmart for about the same price found on amazon and I really like it.  I bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does.  I wanted a chi, but I couldn't pass this one up for the price.  I 've only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well.  A good product for the price!!	1

B00006KPPL:good_for_choosing_a_new_style:purplebubba	This is one of the many different magazines that you can find at discount or grocery stores with lots of hairstyle pictures. They are usually seasonal meaning 4-5 issues a year. This particular magazine is mostly black & white pictures. At least the issues I've bought were. This is something you would buy if you wanted a new hairstyle that would involve a new cut. A majority of the styles in these magazines are shoulder length styles and above. This is a nice item to have in a hair salon for clients to get ideas while they wait	1
B00006IIOY:do_not_purchase:ervin_m._josey_"shafted"	My hunting buddy purchased a Nikon 800. My intent was to put him in the shade. That Nikon kicks the crap out of my Bushnell Yardage Pro 1000. Tried new batteries, tried bluffing, even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past 500/600 yards.	0
B0006L0LB6:coltrane_desacrated:ulysse	John Coltrane was villified most of his creative life for playing at the edge of a world he was helping to redefine. Wynton and the LCJO are in effect the death of creative musicians like Coltrane, or most of the truly creative Jazz scene for that matter. Wynton is establishing himself as "the face of Jazz". A market oriented phenomenon which freezes some of the elements making Jazz without ever capturing the true essence of the music. By telling us (and make no mistake, these guys do...): "this is what Jazz is" and trying to re-appropriate themselves the music of Jazz giants such as John Coltrane who, if he were alive, would not be given the time of day by these folks, Wynton and his posses are raping what is true and beautiful in this music.	0
B0007LXU8Q:best_protein/fiber_bar_ever!:j._williamson_"amazonian"	OK I eat a lot of protein/fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse.  This bar is the best - I eat it for breakfast, lunch or as dessert after dinner. The texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat - seriously. Love it	1
567629	I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house	0
B0002PYONC:certainly_not_worth_the_raves.:jonathan_h._eisenman	The other commentators stress features of this kettle that pretty much any cordless electric kettle will have.  It pales in comparison to my old Hamilton Beach, however, in several respects.  Well, really, one big one.  It's a plastic object.  And it gets very hot.  Too hot.  Hot enough that it smells like it's melting itself.  I got this as a gift, rinsed it thorougly, boiled a pot just to clean it - and it stunk like melted plastic.  Ran it again to try and get the smell out.  Same thing.  Rinsed it with cold water and tried again - still melted odor.  The outside of the kettle near the heating element was very hot even after it shut off (a problem I didn't have with my previous kettle, which I lost in a move), and when I touched it a melted plastic film tacked on to my finger.  You can bet I put this right in the mail back to Amazon.  I normally would hesitate to return a gift, but I'd rather the person have his money back than this thing sit on my counter collecting dust	0

B0002XO5CO:great_item!:anna	Table toppers are an awesome product. We don't leave the house without them. It gives our daughter a clean area to eat and helps the waithelp.... there is no mess when we leave because it is contained on the Table Topper. We just wrap it up after her meal and toss the whole thing. The different designs also entertain our daughter while waiting for our food. Other people, not only parents, ask about the Table Toppers and comment about them because it is such a convenient and easy to use product	1
B000A3Z6A6:14"_necklace:maureen_m._martin_"mmm"	This necklace is just as advertised.  I like it a lot.  I was looking for an "almost choker" necklace.  I would really like a wider one, but this one will do	1
570102	Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious "To Die For."  The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.	0

B000NGCVTE:don't_waste_your_money.:gin_and_tonik	I was very disappointed in this software.  It's not really good for anything and I still haven't figure out why this was even released.  I own Printmaster 15, American Greetings Creata Card 8, and an few other photo and scrapbook programs.  This software has templates to make banners, cards, invitations, and all that stuff.  The templates are few compared to other programs and then to customize them, well you really can't.  If you try to start out with a blank template and add your own photos you are limited to what you can do.  No borders, edging, font manipulating.  It's just insert the photo, do some basic photo touch ups and that is pretty much it.  I wanted to add shadows, edges, frames to my pictures and couldn't.  The fonts could only be made in single color.  You could not add outlines or drop shadows, NOTHING.  Add the font, pick your size, pick your style, and that was it.  You can only save to their 1 file format which of course only works with zoom.  No e-mailing or file converting.  What good is this program I have yet to find out.  I spend time to make a birthday invitation from my own pictures.  Well guess what, I couldn't e-mail it to my guests.  Print is all it does.  Complete waste of money.  This is the first software I ever purchased that I will be returning.  Spend a few extra bucks and get something like Print Master, Print Shop, or something comparible	0
B000IBJEWG:a_good_upgrade:john_l._jones_"jj"	have been using acrobat since v3,v4,v6.  v8 is in line. seems a bit faster, smoother etc.  have tried imitations on other machines.  from a purely subjective view, acrobat is best.  a bit pricey, but the best. with the usual caveats, can be installed on a desktop and a notebook, but requires a call to tech support which was quick and smooth	1

B000065AB0:much_better_than_just_the_'mach_3',_hubby_says.:amazon.com_buyer	I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and I thought they'd improve upon the Mach3.  Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don't know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...	1
271499	This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.	0

B00005V3EJ:too_much_work!!:	This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline; but every single time it rains, I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle!  It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly.  More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it! This is a worthless item	0

B000I06WKY:just_what_the_chocolate_needs;_hersey's_syrup:mikell_czermendy	Though it makes the phone a little more bulky than you might be used to at first, it quickly becomes a non-factor and though it doesn't provide quite as much extra life as I had hoped it would, it does in fact make the difference between my phone dying and my phone being usable for extended convos without that worry. A solid purchase	1
B000F4H5QI:warining:_new_twinings_earl_grey_tea_is_very_weak:w._kim	The newly re-packaged Twinings Earl Grey tea (has the word "CLASSICS" on the package) is much, much weaker than the previous Twinings Earl Grey tea.  If you used and like to the old teas, then you won't like the new version.  I wonder if they have weakened the Britsh version of Twinings Earl Grey Tea	0
B000A6THYY:portable_ashtray:l._l._block	Great for cars that no longer install ashtrays, example Honda. Traps all odor. Once you get the hang of how it opens and closes it's also easy to use at night. I don't think it's a great ashtray but a great disposal system. If a LD light was installed it would be even better for nightime use	1
13511	Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.  Us Weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses.  I'm not buying their story or the magazine again	0
B00008ECSB:best_bra_i_have_ever_owned:chimchim	Once my best friend described my bra size as "beige."  Meaning that when you shop in the "full figure" section of a department store, you feel like you accidentally walked into your granny's closet. Most of the bras are beige, with some black or white ones, and all are gigantic and ugly.	1

394409	I picked up a copy of Spirituality & Health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away.  This magazine is wonderful if you're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life.  This magazine covers everything; mind, body, and spirit, the total package.  In the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in.  I highly recommend this magazine, as I always catch myself saying to someone, "I just read this awesome article in Spirituality & Health...	1

B000F2M0C4:charbroil_grill:lisa	a year ago we bought a performance series and was very happy with it until a week ago when upon lighting it the fire spread out of the pit area and melted the controls.  Char broil was unconcerned and indicated that did not sell replacement parts.  No comments whatsoever on the safety.  It seems that replaceing the grill on a yearly basis is expected at Charbroil.  In the past we have used Weber and got ten years from the grill.  I would look at the Weber	0

B000ASDV6W:most_annoying:elizabeth_nawracaj	The Bissell 2680B Perfect Sweep Dual Brush Sweeper has a pole attachment that keeps coming apart every time you attempt to sweep. This defect in the design, which uses sections instead of one long pole, makes it impossible to use without aggravation. We have put tape around the pole, but it does not work. Now we are going to try screws to hold it together. I never saw anything like this in my life, and hope I never do again.	0
B00000JG4I:leo_kottke's_guitar_music_is_a_gift_to_the_world:frederick_hinds	Leo Kottke is a national treasure.  He is our greatest living solo acoustic guitar virtuoso.  Having said that, you'd expect his CDs to be at a very high level of brilliance.  I have at least a dozen of his titles.  If there is any trouble in deciding the merits of any one disc, it's because there are so many Kottke releases to choose from.	1
B000LV9S1K:looks_nice_for_2_days:irma_"irma"	It was really cute when I got it.  Two days later, the color started chipping away. The stones started falling off as well. I was so disappointed when it happened since it looked so nice when I got it. I do not recommend buying it.	0

B00004COIG:the_best_overall_version_of__the_earp/clanton_feud:terence_allen	The Gunfight at The OK Corral and My Darling Clementine have many things in common. Both of them are among the best Westerns ever made. Both of them had stalwart casts and scripts. Both of them had great directors, Sturges for Gunfight and John Ford for Clementine. Both of them didn't exactly tell the truth about what really happened leading up to and including the famous gunfight that took place on October 22, 1881.	1

192444	A family oriented film that is humorous, fun, exciting and very entertaining! After seeing this movie for the first time, I had to own it! It is hard to find a good comedy that is enjoyable for all ages that is clean. This is a must own for the family	1

B000HCZ9AW:not_sure_why_so_many__bad_vibes_exists:mark_r._junge_"tax_payer"	I think this is actually a very good OS. There are a lot of new features and Home Premium appears to be the best Vista OS for the money.	1
362251	I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD.	0

I had read in another review that the watch was a little bulky, but I found it to be in line with watches of the same type.  This watch works well with casual and work attire and I was tempted to keep the watch for myself.  In fact I regret not purchasing one for me to keep.  Buy with confidence.	1

17883	At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.	1
B000GAT6MM:nutiva_hempseeds_bulk:andrew_alves	If you like hempseeds like I do. This is your best buy. Amazon has the best price. The seeds came fast, fresh, and are terrific.

I would reccomend a silicone skin case for anyone with a razr, they are awesome	1
80835	I use this BBQ with Mesquite lump charcoal and have grilled excellent steaks, and smoked some pork ribs, a chicken, a London Broil and a giant hamburger so far.  No marinade, just a dry rub and on the grill.  The book included has accurate cook times as long as you keep the temperature needle on the "i" in Ideal for as much of the cook time as possible, which is not hard to do.  Make sure to "cure" it before you use it.  This burns off all the smells and chemicals that are in it from the manufacturing. Cure it using the propane burner.   Easy to assemble too	1
B000LNN53A:great_idea:c._gunter	I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it.  I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon.  There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van.  I can't wait to try it out at the mall	1
523115	I would like to classify myself as a moderate but I probably lean conservative.  Because of that, I subscribed to Harpers so that I could read good writing that would challenge my beliefs and stretch my mind in new ways.  I got that, more or less, at first, but over the course of a couple of years the magazine drifted further and further to a leftist propaganda screed, the worst of which was Louis Lapham's bitter drivel editorials.  It got to a point where the writing was incredibly predictable; I knew exactly what position (read:  left of Pelosi) the writer--any writer in Harpers--would take on whatever the issue was, and I had a pretty good idea of what the line of whining would be.	0

475186	I echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here: The magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week.  How many times is a reader going to see no talents such as Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, the Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes joke, and THE most overrated, overhyped people of all time Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the cover and not get tired of it?	0

The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all	0
422776	I love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it.  The product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at.  The S2 IS is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags.  This bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries, chargers and extra media cards.  There is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot.	1

B00021AKMA:this_is_an_obsession:bonnie_sayers_"autismfamily"	I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.	1
B0000X610K:no_improvement:kirk_bigelow_"rocket_farmer"	This battery was no better then the old battery it replaced.  When phone was new, battery life was good. Not sure what is the problem.  Maybe the newly purchased battery is old with no use. Vendor service was good. Or maybe just a bad battery.	0
B00005B6ZR:excellent_product!:li_perron	Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I've found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I'm hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don't like your other regular rollers! Ha)	1

B000225ZTW:it's_just_ok:blryan1973	The shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  The product goes on like Lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  Then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  Overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what I expected or wanted.  I was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.	0

B0002JMEEE:no_good_in_the_winter.:manwithnoname	If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense	0
B00016S2X0:makes_me_nervous:richard_gold_blatt_"live_and_learn"	I like the concept of an elevated design.  They should make the sides breathable.  I have had my son sleeping on this since he came home.  This has been 6 weeks so far.  He twitches and moves his legs and arms, and such.  Typical baby stuff.  He ends up slidding down in between the wedges.  I tried putting a rolled up towell at his feet to keep him up.  You would be surprised how tight he pulls his legs in.  He slides no matter what.  When I put the towell to high his head slid off the edge.  Good Idea needs work	0

B000JDOIBK:excellent_product!:a._cooper	Quality of this product was excellent.  I have gotten many compliments on the looks of this cover.  Would recomment this to anyone.  I have actually dropped my phone and this has protected it.  Only one complaint, the clip is not tight enough on my belt, would recommend a little tighter.  Overall, the best I have ever seen.  The stitches are even and tight, good quality	1

158619	First, if you're thinking about using these photos for print, you may wish to think again.  Most objects run between 300-600 pixels in width or height, or 1-2 inches at 300 DPI.  Stretch them bigger than that, and they'll start to blur and/or get jagged.	1
B000BTXILS:deceptive_and_uninformed_review_by_other_reviewer:jack_offerman_"the_missing_link"	If you notice that when an item is that cheap on ebay that the shipping charge is always Huge to more then make up for the difference. Yes it is "cheaply made and not designed to last", but so are all similar products, so it is at least par for the course in that regard. Just trying to even out the review, I didn't think the other review was fair	1
B000EVRBB6:great_gummi_candy:rebecca_l._roberts	We originally purchased this candy in Walt Disney World at the Japan pavilion.  When we returned home, the kids wanted more of it, but I couldn't find any around town.  I came to Amazon and here it was.  They were thrilled.  It has a good flavor and texture and they really enjoyed it	1
B000000HTY:gong_-_'live_etc.'_(caroline)__4_1/2_stars:mike_reed	'Live Etc' is an absolute must-have compilation for all true Gong fans.It features a total of fifteen live tracks of tunes that originally appeared on the band's key albums 'Camembert Electrique','Flying Teapot','Angel's Egg' and 'You'.Taken from unreleased live soundboard tapes(I assume)from shows between 1973-75.Absolute best cut here is "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" along with "6/8 Tune",that are the disc's only unreleased material.Other cosmic gems include "Dynamite/I Am Your Animal","Isle Of Everywhere","Oily Way" and "Master Builder".Duration is 78:33.Heard they wanted to add the 16th cut that was originally on the 2-lp record,but the CD simply wouldn't hold it.Talk about wanting to give your fans their money's worth.Long live the mother Gong ship!Recommended	1

6303566685:backed_up_for_days!:john_nicholas	This movie gave me constipation that the Gods have never seen!  Not to  mention uncontrolable vomiting. When I was a young Russian Jewish boy ,  before I moved to my navite Japan, I had a pet lizard named Ruby. I loved  to pet his long hairy back while I fed him seaweed and chives. He always  loved cilantro (on the side).  Have I ever told you about my uncle Clair?  He was 5'6&quot; and 423 Lbs. and wore a 48 DDD bro(TM). Oops! I droped my  match! I have to go.

B0002FYR02:not_great...:s._bacurin	My 10 year old son got this for his birthday.  The screws are so deep inside the ball, we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out.  (The ball won't bounce anyway!)  Even then, the screws would not come out!  The lightup goal is great, but the ball is ridiculous.  Use your old nerf balls and then it's okay	0
B00009IMB0:many_months_of_great_use:w._britten_"teag's_crew"	My little guy loved this from the start.  This is a versatile toy that lasted many months.  The mat is machine washable, so it became our take along for travel.  The hanging toys are on rings that detach so you can rearrange them for variety and take them anywhere, such as on the car seat or stroller as baby grows.  He's now 2 yrs, and the mat is still a wall hanging in his room!  This was a great investment	1
369752	Paula's magazine is wonderful...unlike what one of the reviewers wrote about the recipes being bland. They are all from Paula's cookbooks, new recipes or from her friends.  NONE are bland...they are Pure Paula and all have the wonderful southern flare she is known for.  I have been fortunate enough to meet Paula in person and was at a recent taping of her new t.v. show Paula's Party...this magazine is just another wonderful extention of her many talents!	1
B000GFHXEU:these_tumblers_are_great!:linda_j._lanning_"amethyst_218"	I love the large size of these tumblers, as I can get a whole can of pop with ice in them.  The thermal feature works good, the ice lasts longer, and they don't sweat, so I don't need coasters under them.  They are colorful, so each guest can have their own color, no mix ups. They fit on the top rack of my dishwasher, and they don't seem to be marked or scratched yet. After seeing mine, my daughter-in-law got some, as did two sets of my friends.  I am so glad to have found them!	1
B000BMVITE:no_indication_of_need_for_memory_card:c._dumais	NOWHERE on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card (MS or SD).

Wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot	0
95909	The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something	0
B0000027DR:poor_bob,_victim_of_himself!:c._j._zimmel	Awful. I mean, really awful...and I liked "Self Portrait" because you knew Dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image. This album is just a disaster. The lyrics are OK on most songs (I've seen worse by Dylan), but the music is unexciting, not very creative, and downright embarrassing on some tracks. Why, oh, why did you have to make an album like this, Bob? Such talented people at your disposal for these sessions, and you threw it away on garbage arrangements. Shameful. Really sad.	0

237903	Having read some of the reviews here I just thought I should mention that for those who enjoy punk rock music rather than the sameness of most emo music these days they should definitely check out this band! While the singer (Conor Oberst) does have that emo voice so familiar to many other bands, he utilises it well and his conviction can be heard throughout (unlike a band like Taking Back Sunday)	1

B000F6NCZ4:perfect_for_weightlifting_home_gym:tool_guy	Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym	1
B000EMUZ5Y:unusual_but_delicious_blend:betsy_johnson	Ever since I have tried this productI eat some everyday!! It is the perfect blend of savory, tangy, sweet, and a touch spicy.  I know that sounds like a weird combo, but its sooo good, addicting even. I initially  bought this prouct at a local natural and whole foods store, but amazon .com has the lowest price I've seen anywhere and u cant beat free shipping!! It's so conveniant. I have ordered this product from amazon several times and I must mention one order contained multiple expired items that were definitely stale tasting, so I let customer service know and they immediately responded and very pleasantly resolved the matter to my satisfaction. I do suggest the multiple 12  2 oz multiple pack only because this blend is so yummy portion control is helpful!!	1
B000LQI2S0:the_best!:e._elliott	This is the best sound machine out there.....I worked in a doctors office where they used these, and they were amazing.  My husband cannot sleep without some sort of "white noise".  We purchased this and our sleep couldn't be better.  Best bet for the money.  It's also adjustable as far as volume, just twist the top.  Very quick shipping as well.	1
B0006IQK5U:i_used_to_use_tend_skin:savior_seeker	I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps	0

B00006L1B7:brighton_mums_ahoy!:	Calling all Brighton Mums!  This magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design, smothered in advertising for crisp, white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops.  A pretty lousy effort as Australia's top selling interior design magazine.  Though designed for the wealthy mainstream Brighton market, Vogue Interiors will satisfy anyone who doesn't quite know what the colour brown will &quot;work&quot; with.   VI's current editor is David Clark, Art Director is Anna Utzon and Interior Design Editor is Matt Page	0
B00006HQ25:barrel_distortion:d._espejo	I bought the converter since I wanted to use it for landscape photography.

B000GF04Q4:bsrk_control_collar_for_small_dogs:f._qualls	We bought the PetSafe collar for small dogs who bark entirely too much.  It is made of a rigid plastic in a round shape that will not conform to the neck of any of our 3 Maltese.  This particular collar is meant to stay on the voice box area or it won't work.  Unfortunately, because it's rigid, it slides up a dog's neck very easily.  I have worked with fabric and then with foam rubber trying to pad the sides so it can't slide.  Even when I can barely get a bit of fingertip between the prong and neck so that it feels too snug and is also snug on the sides, it only takes minutes for it to start sliding out of position.  A shrug, a shake, or simply walking a few steps is all it takes.  This is a one piece molded plastic unit and for our dogs, is not going to work.  It should also be noted that if you have a nuisance barker who barks at any sound or sight, it may be effective but if you have a dog that barks at a family member, this is NOT a good solution as a shock collar may well result in more problems.  The dog now has another negative association to the person.  Consult a trainer or behaviorist before buying.	0
B0009A2NYM:excellent!!:budget's_gal	I can't tell you what a lifesaver this blanket is. I live in Utah where the winters here can get pretty cold. It definately makes going outside and riding in the car easier to handle. I love it so much, I'm going to give my mother this for Christmas. She suffers from bad arthritis in her legs and feet which is a bad combination when the cold hits her. One of the things she loves, is heat. Even sometimes in the summer she prefers the heat in the car. This of course is not easy from my dad since he's the complete opposite from my mother where he likes the cold. My parents often go on car trips for a few days to get away, and I can see where this may fit in because the heater from the car won't be on so much so both my parents can be comfortable.	1

B0002GS4Z0:great_camera:robert_c._ward_"rob"	Bought 2 of these to watch over my house while I am at work.  Setup is pretty easy, but be prepared to wait a minute after changed settings, many changes when you initial setup the camera require it to restart.  Camera's work great together and the free use of [...] to access the cameras is nice.  Setting up timers and sensor emails/ftp is pretty straight forward but will require a user to test and retest to get the settings just right.	1
475918	I disagree with several of the reviews here which cite several specific points of contention as making the book entirely worthless. I think it easily earns 4.5 - 5 stars. It IS over a decade old now, and I don't think it is intended as a source for scholars of English. But, for the amateur linguist and even the wannabe linguist it is a great read. I can't compete with some of the above reviewer's scholarly points, but I don't think replacing some of Bryson's dogma with their own is worthwhile. Mother Tongue is a great starting point and very educational. "Bryson's Dictionary of Troublesome Words" is also a great introduction and gets 5 stars from me.	1

B00005N7TX:the_only_magazine_for_runners:uh_oh_chango	Running Times, true to its roots, is focused on performance. Worth the price alone for Pete Pfitzinger's Lab Report series and the Owner's Manual sections. If you want to be a better runner at any level, this magazine is invaluable. If you want to understand physiology and kinesiology, you'll find no other resource like Running Times. And if you are interested in the sport of running, the stats and biographies are crucial and are a much needed spotlight on our sport's heroes. Like a true athlete, Running Times eschews junk and filler for focus	1
B0001LVX2C:marvelous:enchantress_of_numbers	Ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up?  Now you can.  You can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off, but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never, ever smudge.  One might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night, but all you need to remove it is water.  This stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved	1

533427	I've been a fan of the Prince of Persia series since I was a little kid. PoP 1 was great, Pop 2 was absolutely unreal. PoP 3D was ehhh....but then two years ago, along came a game that changed everything. "Prince of Persia The Sands of Time," the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone's breath away. The gameplay was original, flawless, and beautiful. The storyline sucked you in and didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over. It was a flawless game.	1

B0009K47ZK:beware!:r._anooshian	We have owned this machine for a little over two years. For the first 6 months it worked as expected with clothes coming out slightly damp due to the condensation method of drying. However, since then, it has stopped drying, such that 5 hours of drying (yes, 5 hours) yields wet clothes. This has persisted, despite 4 repairs, replacing almost every part on the machine except the control board, which I assume is next.	0

B000J3KW7O:cute_cute_&_cute:crazy_for_shoes	I really love the way these shoes look.  I am really picky about shoes I buy.  I dont like to have my toe cracks showing when I wear shoes and I was afraid that these might do that.  They actually do show a little toe crack but only at the end where my little toe is.  I wore these shoes all night on new year's eve and had no problem.  I also wore them all day at work and then to the mall afterwards and did have a little discomfort but not as bad as you would expect with shoes this high.  I love these shoes so much a have 2 pair, black and red.	1
327883	This CD is 100% pure junk! The CD is sung by KIDS! They have high-pitched voices that aren't even good enough to win the school talent show. The other singers are ADULTS who have voices that aren't anything impressive, either. If the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better.	0

51641	Our one year old loves this one, and so do I.  The music is wonderful.  The creative incorporation of Vivaldi's Four Seasons and Monet's Masterpieces are entertaining and educational.

B0002PCT0W:a_fine_fan_for_any_purpose:plant_lady_"jann"	This fan is an excellent value for its price.  It gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds.  Additionally, it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level.  I bought this fan because my old one had "died" in the middle of a hot summer.  This one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room.	1
B00006IEBI:the_finest_pen_you'll_ever_use:	I've been using these pens exclusively for the past 12 years, ever since I noticed that my 10th grade teacher used them to correct my english papers. I have found no pens that even come close to the pilot precise v5. They write in the perfect thickness, they never smear, and the ink flows so smoothly through the rolling ball that there's never clumping. I'm noted for my nice handwriting, and I swear that most of this neatness comes from this pen	1
554413	Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.	0

277343	I got this for X-mas and I am a huge Spyro fan! I started with the second one and this is now the fifth release not counting gameboy games, and the second on Playstation 2. The last one, Enter the Dragonfly wasn't SO successful and I feared there wouldn't be another; but here it is! And SO many things have been added. Buying items at item shops, keychains for keys to open boxes, riding around in the professors new gadget ball, mini-games featuring not Spyro, but his friends,etc. i kind of miss flying Spyro through the rings in the speed race, but...This new Spyro is clearly trying to keep up with newer platform games that others seem to enjoy, but luckily they have kept things from being too hard that you give up eventually and you don't have to worry about wandering around and getting lost in the game. Spyro must learn new tricks like spin pole,etc. as he moves along, and he even meets little dragons like him- Ember,Flame. Hard enough to keep you playing to get through the challenge, but it never seems overwhelming. Some of the mini-game's second levels are a pain, but you can come back later. The strategy guide is also helpful. This time, I don't think anyone can complain that Spyro hasn't evolved or that it's the same old thing, but Spyro fans love Spyro even if it was the same game but with new adventures and levels. He's Spyro! Hours of enjoyment	1

485642	Flight from death is a "must see" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!	1
B0007OV45Y:a_real_problem:early_adapter	After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware.	0

96254	I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam	0
B0001XGNRK:great_blades:c._gupta	I have hard facial hairs (Thanks Dad!!) and after being Gilette user (last used Mac 3), I finally decided to go back to classic style of shaving with Double Edge (DE) razor and blades. Merkur are the first ones I have used after the multi-edge blades and after 4-5 shaves, I am getting closer shaves (w/ no irritation) than by using mutli-edge ones. Also, to get better results, I would recommend a "Badger" brush which really softens the skin before these DE blades with a good heavy razor (Merkur is a good one) can smoothly get your facial stubs. Good luck !	1
B000BN3A4Y:lifehammer_is_a_great_tool:g._kamps_"grck"	It is good to know there is a safety tool like this on the market.

It is lightweight and well constructed, and the directions are easy to understand and follow. I hope everyone buys one.	1
B000E1R8K0:multi_purpose_pan_is_great:p._pryor	This came to me just in time to solve several cooking applications that have been bothering me since the Holidays.  As a lasagna pan it is the perfect depth to make a stellar presentation.  As a roasting pan it works well and holds a small turkey or two 3 lb. chickens.  It's also good for a large casserole for a pot luck.  The pan looks good from oven to table.  Yes - it is heavy to work with because of the cast iron, but I'm really glad to add this to my pantry.	1

But i had never smelled it, i had always hurd it from friends and family that it sucked. Well the other day i was at work and some girl that has always liked me gave me two samples of curve. I tried them out and loved the origanal curve the smell is sweet but still masculine, girls love it, all the time girls say, you smell really good and ask what i'm wereing, and i always say " that smell is all me baby" But really i have curve to thank for all the action i've been getting, you have to try it out for your self.     I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
B0000634T6:simple,_but_effective:rardco	I bought these for some Sony surround sound speakers, although I was initially concerned about the choice because they are made from what is(essentially) plastic.  However, they turned out to be very sturdy, and easy to install.  I also have to commend the mannufacturer for including very detailed instructions as well as a large selection of mounting hardware.  Well worth the price	1

B000CSGIJW:very_easy_to_use:lindae	When I ordered the Plusdeck2 I wasn't sure how well it was going to work.  Well I must say that it works great and was easier to install then I had expected.  I think that the hardest part of the installation was finding a desktop PC with a free 5 1/2 inch open bay.  I like most people now only use a laptop, but I did have an old HP desktop running Windows 98.  The Plusdeck2 was easy to install and I had no problems with it running under Windows 98.  I have had no problems with the conversion to MP3 and it even has a special feature for audio books.	1
B000GW68ZI:at_last!:k._mcgee	Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!	1
B0007WX0NU:awesome_toy!:soupernanny	My 9 month old son LOVES this toy!  It's easily his favorite toy.  He'll gladly do tummy time hitting the piano keys and hitting the dial and characters.  He has a great time making it go, and will now sit up and scoot the car a little.  His other toys were good for a couple weeks at best, this one he only seems to be enjoying more the longer he plays with it.  The music is not nearly as loud or as annoying as most toys and is actually a little fun. Well worth the purchase price	1
B00020UGNE:the_world's_best_cold_remedy.:j._hoelscher_"debater7"	The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.	1
B000EXTXSI:good_hardware,_bad_software_and_support:nerk_in_chicago	I have been using this drive for 5 months and recently upgraded my computer to Windows Vista.  As a result of the Windows upgrade, this product just lost half its value for me.  The drive works fine physically, but the included backup software will not work with Vista when I try to schedule an overnight backup; the software refuses to recognize that you have selected files for backup and refuses to move past that point of the scheduling.  As others have noticed here, Western Digital offers ZERO support for its software - I cannot even find an indication that they recognize there is a problem	0

534353	Excellent camera kit. Versatile. I have a lot to learn about the camera, though, as it is no simple point-and-shoot. However, in Auto mode, it takes great point-and-shoot pictures. I look forward to learning how to use it fully. Lenses came with warranty cards, but the camera itself did not. I bought the SB-600 flash as well and another battery and two 1 GB compact flash cards to round out the kit. Camera with lens attached is large, which I underestimated. $80 camera bag is too small for it all. Great camera, though. Price was the best I could find anywhere	1

B000IEL5G6:prada_cologne_will_make_you_want_to_smell_him.:anna_thompson_"oc_bodytherapy"	Bought this for my boyfriend, and I can't stop smelling him because it's unlike any other cologne I've ever come upon.  It's so intriguing that I find myself sniffing him just to get another whiff of it.  I can best describe it as a soft-suede with hints of amber, vanilla, and wood. It smells better after it's been on the skin for a while.  It does  have a slight feminine scent, however, this makes me like it more, and makes me want HIM to wear it more.  It's definetely for a confident man	1
B000060MLD:not_funny,_&_not_worth_it:tina_martinez	I am not alone here when I say that Knit 'n Style is a joke to most knitters. Myself and my knitting friends agree that it's evidence that someone, somewhere, is seriously deluded if they think that these patterns are what the average knitter is yearning to make. I can't help but believe that if you can't get published in a worthwhile knitting magazine then you go to Knit 'n Style. Because, seriously, they'll take anything and try to sell it to poor unsuspecting knitters.	0

B00000271Z:a_perfect_appalachian_honeymoon_soundtrack:	We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this	1
B000I2UJ0Q:love_it!!!:skithbs	We got this when our baby was about 6 months old, he is now 9 months.

It's a little awkward to move around, but the enjoyment well out-weighs that.	1

424914	im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic Impact with Ice-T.  Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league.	0
B0007PGI7C:beautiful_soft_doll:mama_"mother_of_2"	I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old.  It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle.  I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play.  This doll is also washable, a big plus.  The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly.  A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years.	1

B000IOBZ02:mice_are_nice:0cm	These colorful and furry little mice are great for cats that enjoy chasing small toys. They are treated with catnip, but to be honest, I don't think my cat knows the difference. Unlike their Zanies Furry Mice counterparts, Zanies Rainbow Mice also rattle, since they have tiny pebbles inside them. A word of caution about this though: the pebbles are encased inside a semi-rigid plastic cartridge (which makes up the body of the mouse). The furry fabric is simply wrapped around this plastic piece and glued. After my cat played with one of the mice, the fabric unglued itself and the plastic was exposed. Since there are pebbles inside, unsupervised play might not be very safe. It's best to regularly check the condition of the mice after the cats play with them. Other than that, these are great toys and the price/quantity/quality ratio is pretty good. Quantity is important here, because, due to their small size, most mice will most likely end up lost behind some piece of furniture. Since you get 60 mice in this package, you can just keep replacing the ones that go missing in action. In the long run, it's a lot cheaper than buying them individually	1
B0002OD3JY:another_dissatisfied_customer:mark_duncan	Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.  The camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code E18.  I've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  Nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  Canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer!	0

Some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over. This one is great I love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a 4 year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble!	1
B00004CII4:where's_the_passion?_:david_patrick	Recently I read about the revival of "A Chorus Line" on Broadway. I've never seen the Broadway show or any other staging of it, so I thought the movie might give me a sneak peek.  Well, somewhat disappointed here.  I can only assume that the stage version, with its long-running reputation, must be better than this film.  It's not that the film is a total debacle, but it's only mildly pleasant -- and quickly forgettable.  Even songs which I had heard before, like "What I Did For Love", were reduced to barely a mention in the film.  The film seemed to lack any real point.  A bit of a yawner.	0

564529	I'm going to start this review by saying that I came to the Wii as a lifetime PC-only gamer. I have never felt the need to buy a console until the Wii and its fun controller system came out. The aspect I was most excited about was controlling first person shooters just as precisely and intuitively as the mouse and keyboard, together with the added entertainment of using it for other motion-activated actions within the game (rowing, throwing grenades, close combat, etc). As a result, after spending the night out in the cold to get my console, and flushed with excitement at seeing all the merchandise, I grabbed three games: Zelda (a no-brainer), Trauma Center, and Call of Duty 3. Of those three titles, I'm sorry to say that CoD 3 was the one to leave a bitter taste in my mouth.	0

This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, &amp; slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; and &quot;I Feel Good&quot; included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of &quot;Catfish&quot; to the more acoustic cover of &quot;Leavin' Blues&quot;.  The cuts from &quot;On The Boards&quot; become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like &quot;On The Boards&quot; and &quot;It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again&quot; highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like &quot;Eat My Words&quot; spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are &quot;Dual Carriageway Pain&quot; from &quot;Taste, and &quot;Morning Sun&quot; from &quot;On The Boards&quot;.  The live concert favorite &quot;Sinner Boy&quot; provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album &quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;.  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports	1

B00063KGVE:useless......:emmly	I rate this negative five stars. I just purchased it, thinking, after reading all the reviews, that it was great. What a crock!!!! It's absolutely worthless. It DOES NOT clean the water. It's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy. The water flows and the motor is running, the charcoal is in place but it doesn't clean the water. I'm better off with a bowl that I clean every day. This thing just swishes around dirty water.

B00005OL3Q:astounding!!!:"rod23x"	This is the most amazing knife I have ever owned!  I ve purchased Henckles Twinstars, Sabatier;which is pure junk!  Out of all the knives Ive owned none have sliced with the mastery of these knives. I enjoy the pleasure of slicing and dicing with such serene knives.  I have since decided to sell my other non global knives and replace them with all Global this is quite a bold move as I consider myself thrifty with a nickle but the quality of this knife has beckon me fourth to a place where I must in fact splurge for the quality that i now know I do not want to live without.  I simply cannot quantify how significant the difference in quality between these knives and Henckles Twinstar i really wasnt expecting to open a Pandora's box of spending.  It actually happened quite accidently in my wife whom loves tomatos could not find a knife to cut them properly with and well the other person who reviewed this knife stated as bold fact it got the job done like no other.  I must admit this knife is truly as silly as it might sound the "EXCALIBER of knives.	1

B0001DHHHK:compatible_with_the_epson_r800_and_r1800_photo_printers:l._t._beasimer_"lb"	When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson matte black UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal.  Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.	1

B000034DCJ:find_a_better_sling:shelly_woburn	My neighbor had the Nojo and liked it so I was going to get one too. I tried hers, but I couldn't get it tight enough so my baby hung down too low which didn't seem safe and hurt my back. I thought I could order a different size, but found it only comes in one size. I then read all the reviews here and followed someone's advice and ordered a from babymoon slings. It fit me better (I'm petite) and was a lot easier to use (and prettier!). I think it makes a big difference to get a sling that's not bulky and comes in sizes - I don't get why they use so much padding in the nojo, it makes it really hard to use with a newborn compared to other slings.	0
B0002IHETU:this_is_not_a_toy.:d._hayman	I have an Almansa 435 Seniorita, which is a very lovely little classical guitar, so I have some idea what a decent classical guitar should sound like. I got this little one for my son, who is 5, and didnt want to spend much because you know how children can be when it comes to lessons and instruments. I was very surprised at the quality of the sound. It is still in it's breaking in period, so the strings are still stretching, but it sounds really, really, nice. I even played on it myself (you know, just to get it warmed up for my son!) and it truly is not bad. Doesnt sound "tinny" or "toyish". Sounds like a classical guitar. Now I bought a much more expensive one a few years ago for my daughter, who has since given up the guitar, and that was handmade in mexico, solid wood, 3/4 size, and didn't sound nearly as good as this little thing. For this price, you get a solid spruce top, the finish is nice, kind of matted, the tuners are pretty good, and so far the strings aren't too bad. The base strings look like they could be silver-plated. Unfortunately you dont get any product information in the box so who knows where the strings came from and what kind they are (the guitar is romanian), but the main thing is that the guitar sounds so nice that a child will be encouraged to continue, the teacher will be pleased, and the parents will not have to suffer from more than the usual beginning-any-instrument "noises", and perhaps a lot less because it has such a pleasant sound.  Now of course it isnt comparable to the almansa or to finer guitars, but for a young child who is serious about wanting to study classical guitar, this is a very fine instrument at an EXCELLENT price. This model is sold on other sites for about 20 dollars more, but why pay that?! If you are looking for a small guitar for your young child, this one is a very good bet. A real, very decent sounding, classical guitar for the price of a toy one	1

593859	Companies that embrace work teams quickly discover a basic truth: More teams mean more meetings. Management experts laud the benefits of enlightened teamwork, but they spend much less time dwelling on the often long, sometimes pointless and nearly always inefficient meetings that teams breed. With teams fast becoming a fixture in the corporate world, meeting management, or facilitation, is becoming a critical skill for anyone with executive ambitions. Author Ingrid Bens' definition of a facilitator is quite specific - someone who guides a meeting without actually participating in discussion or decision making - but her book is filled with practical advice that any professional can apply when running a meeting. A host of charts, examples and worksheets (not to mention the accompanying CD) help illustrate her process for steering meetings without controlling or directing the outcome. We [...] recommend this hands-on how-to guide to anyone motivated to minimize the waste of meeting-creep	1
B000002MMQ:a_heartfelt,_emotional,_and_all-around_wonderful_album:tom_benton	I discovered Seal the same way that most people did: through his utterly beautiful song "Kiss From A Rose".  I heard it on the radio one day, and played it constantly for months after that until I finally decided to purchase the album the song was from.  As it happens, the song is from Seal's most revered album, his multi-platinum 1994 self-titled album.  (This is not to be confused with his other self-titled album, his debut, released in 1991.)  I didn't know what to expect when I bought the album, having heard only one song from it, but months after purchasing it I'm glad I made the gamble.	1

B000JEJAAI:i_love_this_bracelet:naofel	This bracelet is very simple and elegant. The pav cz has a great sparkle, but isn't overboard. I also like the fact that it's a rolo bracelet--the links are delicate and small, but very sturdy and have a nice gleam to them. Furthermore, the charm "O" is a nice style and doesn't look gaudy. There are some tiny little dots on the back of the charm (not so sure what those are all about).	1

381699	Good Housekeeping is a wholesome, clean, serious magazine.  Various topics that may be found in an issue - how to raise children, household tips, financial help, or marriage advice - suggest that the magazine is geared towards the middle-aged to the older woman.  I'm married and only in my 20s, but I still get so much out of reading the articles and advice anyway.	1
B00029TCMG:extremely_poor_crafsmanship:1st_time_mom_to_be_"ash"	We purchased the crib, armoire, & dresser w/ tower & it took 5 wks for this to be shipped to us. Once we received it, we opened it only to find that each box contained 2-3 severely  cracked pieces. After inspecting them, we found that the dmg wasn't caused by packaging but, poor craftsmanship. Most pieces were assembled using a nailgun & some of the nails were even bent. The cracking stemmed from areas that had been nailed & continued all the way up the piece of furniture. Had the co pre drilled the holes & used screws instead, this would've never happended. Obviously it's "cheaper" to use nails instead of screws. We took pictures of the dmgs & I wish I could  attach them to this review so you'd be able to see for yourself. There were also several areas inside the crib which weren't sanded properly & would be a real hazard for little fingers b/c of splintering wood. It was advertised to be constructed of hardwoods, but in all actuality it's pine. When you think of hardwood, you expect oak or birch, not a softwood like pine. The tops of the furniture & the drawer fronts were the only pieces that were solid wood. Everything else was particle board. Some of the solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece of wood, but 3 & they were glued together. We're currently trying to return this product for a full refund. We're also shopping last minute for replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date. I would never purchase a another peice of furniture made by this company again.	0

If you can order ahead of time you won't go wrong with this basket.	1

I find it inspiring every day and look forward to reading one prayer per day. None are more than a few paragraphs and all speak straight to the heart	1
537417	I agree with the other reviewer that this is more like a shape sorter than a kitchen. My daughter loved it when she was 1. Now she's turned 2 and she's lost interest in it, like many other "baby toys". I had to get her a larger and more realistic toy kitchen so she can "cook" with it	1

B000MGBR7C:the_yawn_inducing_lp___{2___stars}:norfeest_"yes_yes_y'all"	Some will mistake me for a Evidence hater, but I'm really not.  I just want the man to put some effort into what he does.  I'm tired of taking just any ol' thing artists throw at us nowadays because the "fans" don't expect very much -- or simply don't know what good is anymore.  Sure, you can relate to what Evidence is saying, but you can put on a dope instrumental CD, sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head, have a discussion about any topic, and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album.  I quickly get tired of the "slow flow" -- see: talking -- and I feel like anyone can do it.  I don't shell out money for things I can do myself.  Really, the only difference between him and 50 cent is content.  When I hear someone say "slow flow" my mind translates that into "reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on" because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came.  And lot of these beats, though very dope, are as slow as his flow is.  Couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like Joe Scudda (I'm sorry, I tried to like him, but dude is simply terrible), Big Pooh (same goes for him), and Madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener.  The only dope guest shots come from Phonte, Planet Asia, and Slug.  Yeah, I know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names, but I'm going to keep it honest -- fu** real.	0

It's used for an office and playroom, and it's the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open.  My daughter's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell, so I bought this one.  It took 7 minutes to install, it's not going anywhere, and it's very easy to open and close.  My dogs can't climb over it because the bars are vertical.  I love it, am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter's bedroom	1
B00005QWAB:smoke_yourself_thin__:sarah_bellum	Prior to watching this, I expected something on par with "Striptease" or "Showgirls," which are films about stripping that also attempt to legitimize their titillation by tossing in dramatic subplots. Even with earnest intentions, films of this sort usually end up being clichd and disappointing. Adding to my trepidation was the fact I had never heard of this film, which was released in 2000, prior to 2006. I finally took a chance on it and gladly admit that it really drew me in and convinced me to care about the characters. Like most people, these women only want to find love and something real in life, yet have lost their centers. Indeed, it is the actresses' portrayals of these characters that make each disappointment and set-back so painful to watch. Sandra Oh really moved me with her performance as Jasmine, a would-be poet who sabotages her own happiness because she has come to believe she cannot trust anyone, including herself. Her performance as a sensitive, intelligent person is the most tragic among these lives because she lacks the confidence to escape her current situation, even though she easily could. As Angel, Darryl Hannah is wonderful as a helplessly dim and hopelessly optimistic dreamer. (She also looks unbelievably fit!)  Jennifer Tilly is also very good as the out of control Jo, a woman who tries desperately to win in a man's world, but comes to realize the playing field is not level. Charlotte Ayanna is remarkable as Jessie, an eager to please naf, who has not yet had her spirit crushed by the weight of the world. Come to think of it, it does all sound very clichd and there really isn't much of a plot to tie it all together, just several subplots. Nonetheless, the acting is exceptional, made all the more impressive by the fact much of it is improvised. (And yes, the ladies here all smoke, which would ostensibly account for their trim appearances) I enjoyed the entire two hours and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good character study without the hindrance of a plot. The DVD is quite decent, with a very good transfer, optional subtitles and some alternate scenes. This is a bargain for the price.	1

After waiting for months and months for Office 2004 Professional to be released, when it finally came out I was ecstatic. One problem: VP 7.0 wouldn't install on my G5, only on my laptop. I called Microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 GB of ram. I downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden. The moral of the story is that Microsoft underestimates the needs of Mac users because they are used to wimpy PCs that have no ram	1

0878913467:dreadful:seth_rudy	Alexander Pope was not of the Romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a GRE Subject Test.  This alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why B was the right answer, and why A, C, and D were wrong, but leaves that status of E wholly to the realm of mystery.  The practice test sent out with the GRE registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  I actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  Don't buy this book.  Don't even steal it.  Spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it	0

B000FR2YWK:the_best_kives!:mtgabriela	It does exactly what it says. State of the art cutlery, cutting vegetables becomes a pleasure. It is stunning the precision of this knife; you set it on the food push it and goes down the exact direction intended. It did not go 1/1000 of an inch to left or to the right. I used it for onion, and let me tell you; never in my life was so easy, at the end the onion was so small chopped. It felt like I was cutting air. I even bought a kitchen electric chopper precisely to use it for cutting onions. I do not need it anymore.	1
261775	This book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook (certainly by European standards). But the physical packaging is a total disaster. It has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins. It is difficult to read text near the spine, and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page. The most unuseable book I've ever experienced	0
B000F4H5FO:misslabeled,_terrible_customer_support:david_a._berry	I ordered the loose tea in tins and received 6 boxes of tea bags. The only labeling on the box was a barcode sticker with for tea in tins, which was incorrect. When calling customer service I had only two options -- return the tea bags or keep them and be overcharged. There was no follow up, so there was no way to know if I would receive the correct product if I ordered again. The price had gone up 20% in the mean time. Rather than be without tea (I can't buy that brand where I live), I kept it. You can't get your money back if you are over charged, and you can't complain about it to anyone who cares. I will never use Amazon Grocery again if I can help it, and I suggest you do the same.	0

However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review	0

B000J05PLA:does_what_it's_supposed_to,_but_slows_down_typing.:anonymous	The Keyboard Protector fits very well on my MacBook, but in the end I got tired of how much slower my typing was when I used the protector. It claims it doesn't slow down your typing speed at all, but it really does; you have to push on the keys harder when you type and for me it took a concsious effert to do so. As I'm typing this review now, I'm not using my protector anymore. If you don't mind how it slows down your typing, then go ahead and get it.	0
8312	"The Changeling" has become a little bit dated, however, it is still a very good ghost story. The film stars (George C. Scott) as John Russell, a composer who has lost his family in a tragic accident. He rents a large estate in order to compose his music. It is here that he encounters the ghost of a young boy. Why is the boy haunting the estate? Why is he making contact with John Russell? As the film moves forward, John Russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion.	1

I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes weren't even close to being inline with the display!  The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals.

B00005V3EJ:cover_not_advised_for_rainy_climates:d._barker	There is nothing wrong with this product, it's how you use it. We almost ruined our $300 trampoline in it's first week by using this product. We put it on our new trampoline and it fit fine. It rained the next day and filled completely with rain water, causing the trampoline to nearly collapse. It took a huge effort to remove the water out of the trampoline cover and we have not used it since. Trampolines are constructed using fabric that is breathable and will let the rain run through. By covering it, you don't allow it to drain. Unless you live in a VERY dry climate, I don't advise using a cover	0

B000E97X6G:big_disappointment...:couchgrouch_"couchgrouch"	after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown	0

Very pleased with the online price through Toys-R-Us and Amazon.com, it was $50.00 less than in a retail store!  Very prompt shipping, had to be put together but not difficult with common household tools.  Very nice quality wagon, top of the line and well worth the money.  Rubber tires give a more comfortable ride for small children.  I also purchased the pad set.  Fits perfectly, looks great nad comfy ride, but be sure to purchase the pad set for the Model #29 All-Terrain Cargo Wagon (BP-29), as other pad sets will not fit!  Very nice onverall. Don't hesitate to buy!	1

B0007SMK0S:like_the_crib_(except_for_the_mattress):wiegie	My wife and I like the portable crib quite a bit.  It is great to move from room to room and you can pull it up next to your bed similar to a co-sleeper.  The price is also not bad at all.  The only annoying thing is that the mattress pad that comes with it is so flimsy as to be practically unusable.  (We went to Baby Depot and bought a serviceable pad for about $20.)  Even after buying the extra mattress pad I still think the portable crib was a good buy and I do not regret our decision to buy the crib at all.  (I would buy the crib again if I had to start all over--our son sleeps quite well in it.	1

B00000IUT7:can_you_believe_my_son_isn't_thrilled_with_this_engine?:pammylamb	My 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last Christmas, and for the first couple of months was used practically every day. (And yes, I agree with the rest of the reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them, and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck.) I will tell you that I cannot BELIEVE my son has not touched this engine since. His complaint is that all it does is go around and around. Instead, he enjoys playing out stories from Thomas, or making up his own train sagas. My husband likes to watch the engine more than my son. I don't know how other children play with their trains, but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long. Nevertheless, for the first few months, watching it is really mesmerizing, I could watch it for hours. Perhaps instead of buying this one engine, purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money. It will probably get more use in the end	1
B000INZEPA:everyone_is_human:andrew_koepke	This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.

B0007N7DQO:not_nearly_as_good_as_the_dsc_p_71:hillary	I have been working with this camera for about a year now, for product shots online, and while sometimes it takes great pics, many times the flash pops and whites out, or it goes off and you get a black picture. I take pictures of jewelry, and if I try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration, the color is not accurate. Purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up. While you can fiddle with 4 different picture taking settings, in all different modes, you'll never get the same picture twice, even saving the setting. The light has to be just so, to get a good shot. When it shoots clearly, it can take fabulous pictures, but often, pics are blurred as many others have said, when they actually come out. My old camera, the DSC P71 3.2 Megapixel is MUCH better, colors are accurate always, shooting is flawless and foolproof every time, AND the greatest feature is re-sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading. This feature is completely MISSING from the DSC P200, which was the biggest disappointment, as I figured it would be a given I didn't have to ask about when purchasing. Why would Sony eliminate this great function? Had I know that when the salesman at the large New York City Photo store told me this was the camera I dreamed of, I would not have bought it. I prefer also to use the rechargable AA batteries instead of the Lithium battery, which is super hard to load, and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with. It is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle. Every time it takes me several minutes, and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem.	0

B0009N5486:ehh.:the_milky_mommy	Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it.  Two years later my feelings are very different.  Batteries need to be recharged constantly.  Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.  All I can get is a flashing red light signifying that the batteries are dying.  Zoom is worthless, pictures turn out very blurry and pixelated.  Flash is also way too bright, half of my pictures are annoyingly "white" looking because of this.  Definitely going with Canon on my next purchase	0

My wife was skeptical at first, but I've caught her and my daughter using this pan frequently- in fact, it's become their favorite pan!  Unlike a pure teflon finish, this pan will brown the food nicely.  As far as durability goes, well, it's too early to tell, but the manufacturer touts the longevity of their product.  I like it	1

B00068TJ76:disappointed:frank_e._cannizzaro	I have had an early version of this watch for 17 years, and when it malfunctioned, I decided it was time to get a new one.  The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment	0

B000E0K7CW:terrible_camera:steven_jenkins	I won this camera in a contest and now I'm kinda wishing I never had.  Practically everything I've shot with this thing has turned out bad in some way or another.

I know you may look at this thing and feel like the price is right, but I really suggest you just hold out a little while longer to save up a bit more and buy a Canon camera that's not gonna cause you these problems	0
B00004YUR2:excellent_value:toby_olvera_"etobyo"	It works as advertised. Not a lot to say about a bike rack. I have hardly any wobble from mine, and I suspect those that do didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening the hitch pin bolt down far enough. My only complaint is the weight--it uses a really heavy steel tube for the vertical portion of the rack, which I don't quite understand. The vertical tube has the lowest load, with the highest load being on the hitch draw tube. But it's not that big a deal. It just increases the weight on the rear of the car needlessly	1

Before this I was taking harsh medicines like Tylenol PM's and such and always woke up feeling worse than before I went to bed!  Not with the tea!  Let me clarify, it will not knock you out, but just help to relax you	1
B0002E376I:good_picks,_good_buy.:l._byrd_"the_light_in_the_attic"	They're cheap, durable, feel good, look great, and there's really no noticable difference between them and more expensive teardrop picks except the price and the logo	1
161869	Silly me! I assumed that these bars would taste like spirulina and cashews, but the only ingredient you can taste in them, or any of their other "flavors" is DATES. If you really love dates, go for it. Otherwise, forget it	0
B0000C9ZBW:favorite_watch!:zwriting_"zwriting"	I've had two Skagen Watches and have to say they are my favorite. I love the large face and the Titanium bracelet (you don't have to remove the watch in order to shower!). A lot of people have complimented me on the watch, too. Given the price and quality, you can't go wrong. If you ever need a part replaced, you just send it to Skagen; the work is completed in a couple of weeks! In summary: an elegant watch at a reasonable price	1
B00008W2M5:not_worth_the_$40:john_duffy_"jjd"	I recently bought my second of these. The first had a digital tuner. You had to get used to the feel. After about a year of use, one earphone went out. The one I just bought has an analogue tuner, and it is extremely hard to get any station other than the very high-powered pop (and around here, country) stations. The tuner requires extremely small movements to move way up the dial. I can't believe Sony is charging $40.00 for this cheap piece of junk	0
297078	Although this is a good batch of accessories, the camera case itself is a little unhandy at times.  It has no carry strap -- the camera strap sticks out through a slit in the top.  So, if you want to carry the case by a strap and you decide to take a picture, you must open the case, pull the camera's strap through the slit, then lift the camera out.  It would not keep me from buying this but it does make it unhandy	1
B000KO1G9U:best_case_out_there:john_lee_wilson	This is the 5th Palm treo case I have bought in the last few years, and it is the best by far.  It holds the treo snugly without the need for a top magnet or velcro flap.  The clip is metal unlike many of the crappy plastic ones that break alot.  It is slim and works great	1
B000FPH1VG:this_works:g._bjarnason	I was skeptical about this product but tried it anyway.  It does work and it does eliminate the dip in the middle our mattress had formed.  This has given our mattress a little more life so it will last a little longer until it's time to give in and buy a new one	1
B0002MBP8C:doesnt_work_with_thule_t2:s._foley	title says it all. Dont purchase this to use with the Thule T2.	0
B000BN3T0Y:poor_stroller_quality:k._garcia_"syd's_mama"	I bought this stroller from my daughter, thinking we could transition into it around 6 months.  She hated it.  The stroller lacked back support and she would slide down in the seat.  She would cry within five minutes of riding in the stroller.  After several months of use, the wheel fell off.  Also, the stroller is hard to stear.  You need both arms on the stroller to push.  If you try to guide it with one hand then it goes in another direction.  Even now that she is 16 months old and able to support her own body, she prefers other strollers.  I bought a cheap stroller from Wal-Mart and have been ten times more satisfied.  This stroller was recommended by my brother who has twins and uses the Aria tandam, which I assume is better.  I would not recommend it to another consumer	0

B0006FO56Y:american_gothic:james_f._horan_"jimbo08857"	I am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.It was kind of cornie but with Yvonne(lily munster)DeCarlo and a great actor in Rod Steiger it held my interest,also throw in Michael J Pollard who always plays an off the wall character and I guess that is what keeps this movie afloat	0
B000DINB4G:coreldraw_x3:carl_e._lombardo	CorelDraw X3 is a fine product.  It has added some nice features from V-11.  CorelDraw came with a rebate and I must say Amazon failed big time in helping me apply for it...on line was a joke replied by e-mail 3 time never got a reponse...talked to reps 2 times they did not help....yes I got the product in 5 days....but if you have a small problem....Amazon aint gunna get R done	1
497844	people this is easy listening at it's easiest. Every song is and will be a candidate for adult contemperary rotation in 2 years, that is if it isn't allready. I don't know anything about what they have done in the past, except for a song I remember being played on the radio a few years ago. Must have been on the album prior to this. But that song sounds just like two tracks on this one. Not only that but if there wasn't a pause in between these mini mediocre fests I couldn't really tell any of them apart. Horrible music with no feeling or soul, not even creative. don't waste your time with this.	0

B00005AL5I:not_a_durable_surface.:"gailk"	I purchased this fry pan in June of this year - and it is almost to a state where it is ready to be thrown away as of December 1st.  I would have expected the nonstick surface to be of superior quality and durability from All-Clad, but the sad truth is that I have had cheap grocery store pans that have maintained the coating far longer, and a small fraction of the cost.  After just a few weeks the surface became scratched on this pan and the coating started to come off in the food - ick!  I love the uncoated All-Clad, but I will be looking elsewhere for nonstick in the future	0
B000EGIDPY:huge_waste_of_money!__shame_on_you,_broderbund:lynn_c._behnke	I love PrintMaster.  I'm currently using PrintMaster 16 Platinum.  I have used many generations of this program with great success.  I have taught classes on creative desktop publishing and always recommended--even sold--PrintMaster, but this one is terrible!  Most of the images, even the previews, seem to be online and require a download which is very slow.  The thumbnails are low resolution and hard to see, so you have to download previews just to get a good look.  Most of the images can't be accessed at all, because there is a prompt for the intall/program disk.  There is no such disk.  There are separate install and program disks, neither of which satisfies the program.	0
B00021D8I8:should_have_gone_with_the_tweezerman!:holly_kelley	So, I've owned a tweezerman extractor before, and I am now questioning why I didnt go with my instinct and just stick with the familiar...This extractor is no help what so ever. the loop hole is entirely too small and it would be by complete and utter chance that I would press the right pore. its just too small to even target. the lance is helpful for blackheads but it is really sharp and if youre not careful, you could damage your skin. i would recommend not buying this extractor. i would much rather have preferred to sticking with the tweezerman..	0

B00000IWHF:no_way:fantom	You can get the old vintage aggravation games on Ebay for 10 or less and theres also some hand-made wooden boards as well. These new versions dont hold a candle to the old ones, Just as old tvs seem better than some of the new ones	0
6303614639:moving_documentary:high_sierra	I saw this documentary in a theater when it was first released in the 1970's. 30 years later, many of the images remained etched in my mind. I was shocked to see the living conditions of the miners and their families. I was moved by their stories of struggle and perseverance. We often forget that coal miners risk their lives every day so that we can stay warm and have light in our homes. Regardless of how you feel about unions, this movie will make an impression on you. Highly recommended	1
B000BN3LXE:horrible_product_and_worse_customer_service!!:pen_name_me_"dissatisfied"	Don't buy peg-perego their customer service is horrible!! I will NEVER buy from them again!!	0
48548	Though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology, it's the dryest, most aesthetically difficult to read textbook... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study.  The publisher needs to redesign the book and/or you need to have a better online course professor. It feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material (which is interesting in itself) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction.	0
B000GWX888:katana:j._song_"jay"	I got this as a gift, its too thin for me. I"m not into the credit card sized phones.  Picture quality sucks, its hard to manage it.  the menu buttons are inconviently placed, such as the My content and the address icon should have been switched around for better handling.  its such a hassle to plug in the earpiece plus the connector to the phone!	0
B000BBH0TW:great_christmas_present:kathryn_f._price	I purchased this item as a present for my friend and I. The piece is beautiful and is a great gift for anyone. I myself have the Yin half of the duo. The only problem is that the black paint in the Yin half is easily washed away. Now I don't mean that it all washes away but it does erode. The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away. Other than that minor defect the necklaces are wonderfull. I'll definately be buying from this seller again	1
B00064ATVK:medela_is_a_name_i_trust_for_breast_pumps:s._glasser_"spckstr46"	I breast fed my son for a year in 2003 with the Medela pump back then.  I trusted Medela to pick up this one for my daughter this year.  I pump once a day, so they get used, but not abused.  The model has changed some, I think it is more powerful this time.  The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield.  My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option.  I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap.  I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.  I leave the speed where I need it before and take the bottle off while it's still on and put it in the bottle holder while I turn the unit off.  I still very much like this product as it gets the job done	1
B000KA3P70:cute_little_shoes:shoe_head	These shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute!  I wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week. Turns out Jessica makes pretty good shoes.........CUTE!!!	1

B000HCSMOW:very_pleased:pat_c.	I just received this table cover and am very pleased. This is a high quality  product: the material is heavy and lined with waterproof rubber and the construction is superior, with double sewn seams and heavy-duty hand grips. A much better product than I have seen for similar prices in local stores	1
B000I4UQFC:great_features_bluetooth_dificult_setup_w/dell_latitude_notebook:feral_"feral"	Great features with the Microsoft mouse.  Wanted at least a 4 button mouse so internet travel is much easier. Comes with a USB dongle that I did not want to use so I was determined to get this mouse working with the built-in Bluetooth in my new Dell Latitude notebook.  Found that the Toshiba drivers provided by Dell for the Bluetooth would not work with the Microsoft mouse.  Seems still some incompatibility with different manufactures of Bluetooth devices.  Go figure....  Had to delete the Toshiba drivers and let XP with SP-2 provide the drivers and it works great.	1
B00006BXJZ:dont_listen_to_the_bad_reviews.:kory_gancarz_"gcarz"	Plain and simple...Cage is one of the best Underground rappers around.....And soon after Hell's Winter drops I think he will be accepted into mainstream......This CD is Cage at his craziest, the beats are hott, the rhymes are hot...BUY THIS CD....and if you like this CD buy some of his other CDs, Weatherproof, Night Hawks, Smut Peddler's : porn Again, The Leak Brothers: Water World, and Hell's Winter	1

B00006JT6O:wonderful_smell....:r._kirsch_"raekay207"	First of all I am in my early 20's so I haven't much experience in night creams.  I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness.  I use "moisture therapy cream" by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night.  My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did.  I can't give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier.  The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to.	1
B00004R69G:kentucky_fried_idiots:ace_preston_"ace_preston"	This movie is so stupid it is funny.  I saw it when it first came out and I still haven't forgotten it nor will I ever. This is what the writers of the Groove Tube, Saturday Night Live, and Second City Television are all about.  Watch this film and see a true comedy classic.  Individual skits like "Catholic High School Girls in Trouble" could have been made into a full length movie all to itself.  It was an era where one didn't have to be politically correct.  This is what comedy is all about.  Forget the garbage we see today.  Forget Martin Lawrence or Cedric the Entertainer.  See Kentucky Fried Movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was.  Oh, by the way, Stephen Bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he isn't singing "On and On"	1

B0000CFYCH:for_old_computers_only:d._knowlton	I did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the SERIAL port on a computer.  Since most new computers use USB for serial interface, the usefulness of this unit is limited.  My two newly purchased HP computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product.	0

B000BNP98E:great_buy:j._brown	Great value - sure, case could be metal instead of polymer, but for the price the capabilities of the watch can't be beat...very intuitive interface and easy to use...compares favorably to watches costing 3-4 times as much..	1

B000FS0STA:great_case!:m._l._caron_"gamer_mom"	We ordered this case for our son's Creative player, and it's a hit. It fits snuggly, he can access all the functions with no problems, and the loup allows him to attach it to a variety of cords and "leashes" during different activities.	1
B000N2VRKC:fox_has_not_taste:caleb_g._harmon_"imthecableman"	Once again, Fox has cancelled a brilliant show. While it is occasionally a bit off-color, the dialogue is brilliant, but apparently people couldn't follow the episodes, so no one watched this great show, and it was cancelled. I haven't tried the download option, but I highly recommend the show	1

B000EHQX9G:smaller_than_i_thought:m._green_"mystery/suspense_love"	This toy was a huge disappointment for me. My boys took one look at it and threw it. I thought it was much bigger than what it is. I was also upset that I spent as much as I did and it wasn't even a decent size. My boys are moving to a car themed room and it just wasn't what I envisioned. It also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children	0
B0002HL0EG:nice_diamonds..._great_price.:peter_m._bouton	Its tough to beat the price of these 1/2 ct. diamonds for $199; they looked really good and the wife loved them.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because they only have non-screw backs and they didn't come with a diamond spec sheet to verify what you got.  But for the price, a minor quibble... you won't be disappointed with your purchase	1
B000NPLXAI:great_webkinz,_bad_price:	This is a very good Webkinz as the plush and as the virtual pet. It comes with a rare TV and other supplies. it is also very soft. The only bad thing is the price. Don't buy Webkinz online, the price can go up to $50. The real Price is $11.99, which you can find them for that price in stores	1
6302534372:truth_stretching,_and_all-out_fabrication:hans_pfaall_"eight_miles_high"	I saw this movie as a kid when it came out and liked it, but since then it has gone through something of a critical reevaluation. Goodman is an entertaining actor, but there are just too many factual errors, and they arguably detract too much from the film's quality.	0

535321	I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.	0
B000BNCA0Y:favorable_experience_with_kurt_kinetic_trainer:richard_hughes	I am very happy with the trainer.  Most impressively, it is much quieter than my previous mag trainer. I can easily listen to music while riding without the music being so loud it bothers the rest of the family. I ride about 30 minutes a day on it .... it is a great part of a cardiac risk factor prevention program	1
B00015YRF8:excellent_product:amber_uncapher_"organized_mom"	This product came in excellent condition. I think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another. Everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch! The only assembly I had to do was to re-adjust the plastic dividers. I ordered it May 25th and received it May 26th. Very fast shipping!! I'm very pleased	1
198915	This remote is so hard to use and setup. The Xpress functions don't work properly and when used switches to different inputs each time.

B000EGAL5Y:lumbar_extender_back_stretcher:joe_w._jackson	For two years I suffered with four herniated discs.   Physical therapy, a spinal injection , chiropractic adjustments, and many sessions on a spinal decompression machine provided short term relief.  I started using the McKenzie Method extension exercises, and this offered the most relief.  Fortunately, I finally discovered the Lumbar Extender in an internet ad.  I noticed that it placed the spine in a similar position as the McKenzie exercises.  So, I decided to order the Lumbar Extender to determine if it would provide better relief than all the other methods I was using.	1
113901	Boy, the folks at EA really outdone themselves this time.  Just when I thought 2003 was the greatest NCAA ARCADE game ever EA releases NCAA 2006.  This blows 2003 out the water.  I never knew it could be sooo much fun having the CPU complete 80 Yard TD pass every single time.  Nor did I know that the bomb is the most acurate pass in the game.  Who needs realism in a football sim when you can just bomb the ball down field and have it be on target every single time.  This game punishes you for trying to play like a real football game, so why not just bomb it every time.  If your receiver drops a wide open 5 yard pass, that just means he wants you to throw it 60 yards down the field and he'll have a much better chance of catching it.	1
B000328PLQ:meh:general_zombie	I find tomatoes to be overrated.  They're an important ingredient in many things, obviously, but as an item themselves they're of limited use.  They taste alright, but their texture is too screwed up.  The only time I ever really eat raw tomatoes is on hamburgers and sandwiches, and usually prefer not to have them, as they destablilize the whole sandwich so that it all falls apart.  Obnoxious, that is	0

B00021B9O8:so-so_eyeshadow:julie_a._adkins_"wildfire68"	The eyeshadow isn't bad, nice color, but the packaging was a disappointment. The brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can't get very much onto the brush. There is no way to open the casing either, so its pretty useless. I found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also.	0
B0000EI9VU:don't_order_until_you_have_the_camera_in_your_hands:carol_p_"carol_p"	I recently ordered a Kodak camera from Amazon.com. With that I also ordered this battery & the camera bag. Everything was delivered as expected, EXCEPT the camera. Over 2 weeks later I was notified the camera is not available. Now I'm stuck with a battery & camera bag that I can't return because they came from another seller. The camera I bought from a different seller came with the bag & uses a different battery. Now I'm out the cost of the battery, the bag & the shipping charges! Thanks a lot	0
219604	The Godfather: The Game allows you to live the Godfather movies. The storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well.

B0002OSNOE:perfect,_inexpensive,_duffel_bag:m._daniels	Was delivered quickly, was priced right, and folded up into a small size so I could stuff it into a suitcase before going on vacation.

B0007Z0VVQ:solid_performance:who_cares	I was never a diehard Huey Lewis fan but this group definitely adds to that genre we call rock n roll. If you're looking for another dvd you can add to your concert collection, this one is worth the price of admission. I'm not familiar with all the original members so just having Huey as the front man and with the other members cranking out the songs as I remembered them, it was memorable, high-energy performance. One little thing was somewhat of a distraction to me. About halfway through the show, Huey's shirt had a meltdown. All of a sudden it looked like he got caught in a major downpour. Am I the only one that noticed this? But it just goes to show the man was giving it all he had. Who could ask for more	1

B000077DD4:excelent_for_beginners!!!:r._drake_"language_learner"	I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.	1
B000BMVITE:false_advertising_,_it's_not_portable_-_requires_you_to_purchase_a_special_battery:cassidy	Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be "portable" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction.	0
B000J09V4C:top_of_the_line:danoon	This is the best wind up light you're going to find. I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event. Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus. I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only $35.00 and well worth it	1
B0009RG8WS:how_easy_can_you_get?:jennifer	I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.	0

14537	Great features!  Probably the best pedometer out there for the money.  The only reason I give 4 vice 5 stars, is that I think the one I bought for my mom (same brand and model) is slightly more accurate.  A great way to track your fitness overall	1
B000184OCQ:do_not_order_-_product_and_service_nightmares!:applehead39	I ordered this product for more than what its new price is on December 21, 2006 as a Christmas present for my mother. It didn't arrive until January 9th, and it arrived damaged!  We sent it back for a refund.  On February 2nd, this low-rate item arrived at our doorstep again, AFTER I checked several times by phone to make sure that my order was marked as a RETURN and not an EXCHANGE.  We decided to set it up and see if this one was better.  STILL DAMAGED in another area. I have called The Sharper Image over ten times now over a span of 2 months. I know their customer service number by heart, and I even know their direct customer service number (without having to go through the machine) by heart (call 1-888-344-5555 instead of 1-800...). Their shipment is slow and their processing is painfully slow! They've given me 3 different order numbers without telling me, so I couldn't get accurate information about my order online.  Beware of dealing with this company.  If you can, go into a Sharper Image store somewhere, take the thing out of its box to examine it, and only then consider bringing this product into your house.  One good thing is that they do give you a full refund, tax included.  At least that's what they told me by phone today.  By the way, this should be called a Foldaway Strider, not Elliptical.  It absolutely does not have the elliptical wheel or power that other more functional elliptical machines do	0
B0002Z453G:breaks_easily:g._cribbs	I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works.  Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise.  My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them).  the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy.  I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well	0

317349	Yes, it's the bible of cooking.  Its like a degree at the culinary institute.  However, its not an easy book to cook from.  Most recipes refer to several parts of the book for details on how to prepare different parts of the recipe.  So you contstantly have to page back and forth in the book.  Its intimidating for the novice who just wants to cook, but if you really want to learn about cooking then its THE book to have	1
B0000798L1:ok_for_smaller_children_maybe:christine	We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food	0
B00009KGGI:not_suitable_for_human_nails:kfk	I agree with the reviews from the other reviewers.  It basically ruined my nails the first time I used it.  However what I did discover is that this is an excellent products for keeping my dogs claws trimmed.  After trimming their claws you often get rough edges.  I now use this manicure kit to smooth the edges and keep their claws short.  They don't seem to mind it becuase it is very quiet.  I must state that I will never again use this product for my own nails	0

46408	Having watched most, if not all of John Waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this Album, obviously his name was put to something he hadn't quite looked deeply enough in to. Talk about misleading. As we all know John Waters has a certain reputation for sleaze, trash, camp, kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms, this album had none of this. Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis	0

582899	In installed this product on a Dell Optiplex GX110 (admittedly not the latest, but still a very standard machine) running Windows 2000 with 512MB of memory. In spite of spending literally hours with the software I was unable to get it to produce an outline or dimensioning of a wall being drawn by dragging the mouse, as clearly illustrated in the accompanying video. Without this feature it is virtually impossible to efficienctly produce exterior or interior walls. Multiple emails to Broderbund have produced autoreplies suggesting that I refer to their Website for help. This site is essentially worthless for all but the most fundamental problems (like not being able to read the install CD).	0

B00000K08G:well,_it's_not_that_modern.:"vchudows"	&quot;Modern&quot; usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch.  It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop.  The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are  basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics  and great hooks.  I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch  Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy &quot;Operator's Manual&quot; or  &quot;Going Steady.&quot;  Or dig up the amazing &quot;Different Kind of  Tension&quot; from a used record store somewhere!  Also, see them live if  you have a chance	0

B000HZGNH2:didn't_really_do_it_for_me:gregory_masciola	I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense.	0

527087	I enjoyed this wholeheartedly. Mainly because wwe did a little tweak on the formula. Instead of mimicking the one-time use of the Flair dvd formula or using the formula that everyone else gets this three disc sets spreads everything around. All the featured stars get their own video package highlighting parts of their career that made them famous or recognizable. Then every wrestler gets their own match, some of which overlap which makes things interesting. Although we do see some perennial "best of" favorites it was nice to see some obscure pieces of footage. Who would have guessed Sal Bellomo would be on a dvd in the 2000's. If wwe continues releases with rarer footage, I think they'll have a better chance at impressing the older members of the fanbase	1
77162	I recently started Weight Watchers and was looking to purchase a new and accurate scale.  I figured I would buy a WW product, but after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the Omron scale.  I am very pleased with this product.  It has been extremely accurate.  It keeps a history for both my husband and I.  I would highly recommend this scale to anyone!  It is also an attractive scale which is a bonus.  Go with the Omron scale	1

With his delectable wife Annabel in tow, he has set the strangers a task of sorts, if they can spend one night locked in the house he will give them $10,000 each, however there is a bit of a catch to this seemingly generous offer, the house has seen several brutal murders and is reputed to be haunted.	1
B000231EKA:good_toy,_if_you_don't_mind_horribly_off-key_music:t._burch	Our son received this toy for his first birthday.  It has a lot of good features--teaches colors, numbers, farm animals and their sounds, several songs.  But the music is AWFUL--the singer is off-key on every single song (either that, or they did a bad job of matching up the music to his voice).  As someone who appreciates music, I cannot tolerate listening to this, especially since there are far better toys out there.  Since our son already has 2 LeapFrog toys which teach the same concepts as this toy (the Learning Table, which has much better quality music, and the Fridge Farm), we will be exchanging the Vtech Discovery Nursery Farm for a different toy	0

It says this will work on an arm circumference of up to 18 inches. Not even close. My arm is a little under 13 inches and was too large for the cuff by far. Sure, you can get the cuff to go around your arm, but there are indications on the cuff that have to line up for it to work properly, and there was just no way to even come close	0
B00005AREQ:guitar_classic:boston_bluesman	This is Jeff Beck's best album.  A masterpiece of guitar work.  This is an all instrumental album that features what Jeff does best - play guitar.  The supporting band is excellent especially the drum work.  Production quality is excellent as well.  While I wouldn't consider JB a blues guitarist I would consider him one of the top 10 guitarist ever and this album show cases why.  A great companion album to Blow by Blow is Wired.  It's a shame that after Wired his record company made him go back to albums with vocals.  He has on a roll and at a level that he has rarely gotten back to. If you like guitar and can live without vocals buy this album. You will not be disappointed	1

B0000733CY:great_suitcase_for_the_cost:morgan_giddings_"tempest_and_fury"	This is a great hard-side suitcase for the price.  It is basic and simple, but seems quite durable and functional.  I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not "TSA" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.	1

0936262508:glorified_magazine:john_"jcsanddms"	Let's make this clear... I won't put any more effort into writing this review than the author spent on the book itself. So this is going to be short and sweet!  This book is a glorified magazine.  Worth $14.95 - tops.  The pitfalls of bookbuying online, I guess.  You never know what you are going to get.  Anyways, most the book comprises photographs that actually discourage me from bothering with infrared.  The text portion, however brief, is nothing more than a bland introduction to infrared.  The uninitiated might even be led to believe that Kodak and Konica are the only game in town in infrared films.  Throughout the book the author treats these two as the &quot;Coke and Pepsi&quot; of infrared films.  I'm going to look elsewhere for a good source of info on this subject and suggest you do the same	0

548214	The people who have mentioned Aphex Twin and Four Tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists. If you liked the Stone Roses you will like this. It's not an 'electronic' album at all. I've ordered Manitoba's earlier cd after listening to the samples (the reason for purchasing both these albums) and I certainly hope it sounds nothing like 'Up in Flames'. It's funny, I promised myself I would never buy an album again without listening to it and yet it seems that samples on the net can be misleading, either that or Dan Snaith has had a serious identity crisis in the last few years	0
105263	The author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the Chamber of Commerce or a right-wing think tank. Like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. In his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. He is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. He finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. His low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. Most in the West do care. Rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment.	0

244122	Sarah Brightman is one of my all time favorite artists.  But this disc is just a complete waste.  It is missing so much, and has too many songs that don't belong.  Like the phantom songs.  As much as I love them, save them for the Andrew Llyod Webber collections.  Can't we have a nice singles collection with just her solo works starting from "Dive"?  Her "Classics" album had it right.  Except their version of "Captain Nemo" was the rip off live version.  And THIS cd doesn't even have the Captain Nemo song, which is a HUGE fan favorite, and definitly was a single.  It is also missing How Can Heaven Love Me, Eden, Harem, and Beautiful.  All singles as well.  Save your money.  Either buy the "Classics" album for a somewhat better compilation, or just make your own mix like I did.  Because Sarah has so many wonderful songs (And quite a few bad ones I will admit)  And it seems on here they give you some bad ones (like requium and nella fantasia), and leave out the good ones.  "It's A Beautiful Day" and "What You Never Know" are good, but are the weakest songs form Harem.  Why on earth would you leave out "Harem" and "Beautiful", but leave on Beautiful Day and WYNK?  Whoever put this set list together must have not put much thought into it and is just trying to cash in.  I bet Sarah didn't have much say in this compilation.  This is just a waste.  Beautiful album cover though	0

There are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different. It was very frustrating...then it wouldn't stay together once it was finished.

I was always skeptical previously and just asssumed these things scratched the car. But my paintless dent removal guy uses one and highly recommended the California Duster to me. He is fanatical about keeping his car totally detailed. And this product works so well that he never even washes his car unless it gets rained on. He just dusts it every morning before he backs out of his garage, and if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer and a microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it. It takes a total of less than 2 minutes to dust off an entire car, yet the result makes your car look like you just washed it.	1

B000HCTYTE:windows_ultimate_garbage_os:kazutosan	This OS is not for any ordinary user.  If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS.  Lots of incompatability issues.  I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work.  Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc.  BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP.  I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs!  Stay with XP Pro SP2.  Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP.  It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out.  Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't.  Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS.  You fail.  Nice try	0

414938	This is my favorite magazine in the universe and the only one to which I have ever subscribed. However, after this, my second subscription is over, I plan to call it quits. The magazine never gets delivered unless I send several angry e-mails every month reminding them and demanding delivery. When the issues come they are often 2-3 months behind. The current issue is over three weeks late and who knows when and if I will ever see it. In the end, although this is a brilliant publication, it simply isn't worth the headache. Photo, if you're out there, please forward me the June issue.... and while you're at it get a head start on July and August and maybe they'll make it on time	0
B000GSEQPG:great_looking_helmet:s._gentilhomme_"www.website.ws/gentils"	The helmet fits snug on my head.  No complaints about its styling. There is only one complaint.  I purchased this helmet because I heard the horror stories of people saying there helmet would fog up.  This helmet stated that it was an anti fog helmet.  Not true.  I still have to pull the shield up, or pull the helmet up.  Other than that its a great helmet	1

B00016XO7O:big_bird_too_whiney:corey_hartman_"c_hartman"	I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act	0
B000FKHSAK:why_do_dermatologists_recommend_this_s***?:richard_g._trezevant	Molly, daughter or Richard- I usually write positive reviews on this site but not this time. Why on earth do dermatologists recommend this s***? Last year my hormones were all out of wack and I had a period for a whole month. I broke out severely as one would expect. Dermatologists  (including mine) swear by this aweful chetaphil. I HATE IT! It wasnt strong enough for my skin. It made my acne even worse if you can imagine! I'd been using it for four months when I finally decided enough was enough and I started using Neutrogena Frangrance Free Facial Cleanser. That change made all the difference in the world! I still do have acne but now it is mild acne instead of severe acne. Now its mostly just old, light scarring and the occasional breakouts around my chin and lips the week before my period.  One of my friends is a dietition and she also has used Cetaphil and didnt like it at all. Please do not buy Cetaphil even if your dermatologist recommends it. You will totally regret it	0

542094	We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.	1
B000058DN9:great_cups:christina_marston	I absoulutly love these cups.  They are the best no-spill cups on the market.  My 1-year old loves to walk around with it and throw it around.  It never spills which is a great thing when I have red Kool-Aid in it!!!	1
B000FBPH9I:good_-_but_it_is_not_a_250-watt_sub:m._wilkerson	I was very surprised at how well this sub articulates the low frequencies.  Hearing is believing.  It gives a certain amount of accuracy and tangibility to base tones that I simply was not able to obtain with a higher priced sub I had purchased.  For movies, it does a wonderful job of augmenting the atmosphere of scenes without being too boomy.  It really enhances music by bringing out lower notes and sounds that are not normally perceived with the use of most other subwoofers on the market.  I am not certain it can go as low as 27Hz since I have not measured, but I am not concerned with trying to disturb the neighbors or shake the walls.  I just wanted to obtain the most precies and best sounding system I could.  I was able to do so with the addition of this sub.  I am glad I found and tried it before paying much more for another sub I was considering.	1

B0000AR86P:an_absolute_dud...i_wasted_my_money,_so_save_yours!:james_stillman	In my opinion, this thing is flimsy and worthless.

Once you bring the bar crashing into your forehead on your first or second chin-up, you realize that you've already thrown away your money and now it's time to throw away this product.

For about $40, you can get an "isupercharger" that you can plug into the wall, plug into a car lighter, plug into a USB port, or run off of a 9 volt battery. With the 9 volt battery option, you can use your iPod all you want, even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping. It's a small, all-in-one design. I don't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along.	0

25956	"Spin" is an accurate name for something like this -- a lot of hype, for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine. If Rolling Stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines, then Spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he's cool by name-dropping the Strokes.	0
B000BMAQ8S:iogear_usb_sd_reader/writer_gfr202sd:bagels1941	I purchased a SanDisc 4 GB SDHC card for my camera. At the time it did not occur to me that neither my SanDisc Image Mate 6 in 1 nor my SIIG 18-in-1 Reader/Writer would not be able to read this new version of Secure Digital. Long story short-I called IOGear tech support and was assured that this reader would work although netiher their promotional materails nor their packaging indicates that it will. Bottom Line: It works and it was a very inexpensive ($10 at CompUSA) solution to my problem.	1

B00005JMB3:yet_another_bad_sequel_from_disney;_see_'lilo_and_stitch_2'_instead:t._nakajima	They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.	0
B00068O1Y2:amazon_should_be_embarrassed:nathaniel_b._thompson	Bad enough that the toy is a scam that requires extra  parts.

They know they made a mistake. If only they  would contact us each now for a full refund.	0
316373	This movie is a must have for all family libraries. It appeals to adults and youth alike. A true feel-good movie about how we are all the same inside, no matter what our outward differences are. Really teaches the lesson, "Don't judge a book by its cover".	1

B000A2UC2E:is_this_the_best_lieberman_can_do?:matthew_king	I was intrigued by "Satan's Little Helper" due to several things namely its Halloween theme, which I'm a big sucker for, and the heralded return of Jeff Lieberman to the horror scene.  Lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70's and 80's, the last one being 1987's "Remote Control".  You would think that Lieberman, with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return.  Well, it almost feels like Lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp, as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80's due to how cheesy, trashy, cheap and godawful it is.  Many, myself included, look upon the 80's slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be.	0

6304584210:disappointingly_unfunny:	This mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny. Considering the comedic caliber of its two stars, Billy Crystal and Robin Williams, I was expecting a laugh riot, but that's not what this is. It's not their fault, it's the scriptwriter's. I guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper, but that humor just didn't translate to the screen, despite the best efforts of Mssrs. Crystal and Williams. They deserve better, and so do we	0

B000ETZU8E:24_game:d._lloyd	This game was put together with a nice concept, be a CTU agent and help Jack Bauer stop the terrorist attack.  Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game.  However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well.  Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work.  Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end.  I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly.  So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success	0
273596	I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his	0
501696	Although it is very funny, and it is about talking animals that drive cars, "The Wind in the Willows" is not suitable for four to eight year olds to read on their own.  That would be the Disney cartoon version, not the book, which is pretty sophisticated for such a young age group.  It is great to read aloud, however, and for older kids who love nature and humor, "The Wind in the Willows" could lead to a lifetime love of books.  "The Wind in the Willows" reminds me of the Victorian humor book "Three Men in a Boat", because both are about the adventures of a group of wacky English bachelors messing about in boats on the river.  It is funny, with real slapstick comedy, and it is also touching, because it deals with friendship and loyalty, and beautiful, because it is about nature, and love of the countryside and home.	1

428597	I was very disappointed with this magazine.  The tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them.  Most articles are rather pretentious and boring.

Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.	0

67952	An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman	0
B00004TQMQ:excellent_first_thinking/strategy_game_for_kids:h._lewis	Bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it.  More challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games.  I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and introducing the concept of strategy	1
B000E9BW18:disappointed:c._costa	I bought this toy for my 9 year old son who loved it at first but after awhile he was dissapointed. It stopped working correctly on one side. The remote may be the problem, I am not sure. We changed the batteries but that did not help. I felt bad I bought him a Christmas gift that didn't last the day	0
B0000AZJVB:great_product!:patrick_leonardi,_author_of_"the_ultimate_golf_instruction_guide:_key_techniques_for_becoming_a_zero_handicap_golfer_or_better"	Definitely worth the money. For example, Excel is a great program. It is pretty easy to use and not too hard to figure out. You can add up figures in a snap. This product provides a great service to companies because of the usefulness of this software.	1
B0001WUWR8:save_yourself_15_bucks:m._wilson	We purchased this for our daughter as a Christmas gift.  What a nightmare.  First of all, the scissors it came with...well let's just say my teeth cut better.  This scissor is so DULL we'd be willing to allow our three year old to handle it.  It cuts NOTHING.  This sewing machine comes with one tiny square of material, so you have to be sure to have material on hand if you want your child to actually attempt sewing something.  It's incredibly difficult and frustrating to thread the needle.  The stitches are way too loose and break apart at the slightest touch.  There is no bobbin, so there's nothing to hold your stitch together.  We wanted to make a simple little pillow for my daughter's dolls...wishful thinking!  The minute you attempt to turn your project right-side-out, the stitches come apart and you have NOTHING.  My daughter just walked away. We can't believe Singer would be the maker of this 1.99 piece of plastic.	0
B000AN1YES:not_a_healthy_tea.:liz_"spiritual_seeker"	I ordered what I thought was matcha tea powder. a comment on the page said it was SLIGHTLY sweetened, no specific nutritional info was available when looking to order. on the info when the tea arrived was a calorie count of 393cal/serving, and ingredients which include corn syrup solids and partial hydrogenated oils. not what I was expecting from a green tea powder. would NOT recommend	0

B000AMCAUG:very_accurate_timekeeping,_easy_to_set,_clean_design,_price_is_right:justin_morgan_"programmer,_astronomer,_gadget_addict"	After receiving my La Crosse atomic clock, I followed the 4 simple steps on the back of the box and left it hanging on my wall overnight near a window on the west side of my house.  Basically, to set it up all you do is install a AA battery and press a button on the back of the clock to set your time zone (ET, CT, MT, or PT), the clock will do the rest overnight.  The reception of the signal appearently clearest during the night, according to the instruction manual.	1
B0001NE7F0:this_games_stinks!!!!!:darlene_m._lopez	I couldn't wait to play this game.  I've been a fan of SNL for over 20 years. I was sooooo disappointed with this game.  The questions are horrible!  They are difficult to read and undestand.  The only good thing about the game is the fact that the game pieces are cool.  Otherwise, save your money.  It's not worth the $$$$.  BOOO Hisssss to the creators of this game!  You ripped off your biggest fans!!!	0
B000HCVR3K:nicer_looking_with_visual_aids:tom	Office 2007 is a nice step up from Office 2003 (and earlier) as it has better visuals on the toolbar. e.g. Instead of just seeing the worded commands on the toolbar where one clicks on the command and then gets a drop down list to choose from with more commands, i.e. File, Tools, Edit, etc, you'll see tabs with different commands on the toolbar. When clicking on the tabs, it sets up across the toolbar, all of the functions of that particular tab. Once viewed, you not only see the words of the functions, but also, small example graphs and images of what that functions does. This only applies to all the applications other than Outlook, which pretty much retained the same look and feel as 2003	1

B000FGC41M:not_hot_enough:c._comeaux	I bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - So I thought one of them might actually be hot.  Instead, the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot.  This may be a "lawsuit friendly" reality with heating pads today - I've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago (I had that one for 10+ years, the Sunbeam replacement I bought prior to this one lasted 2 and wasn't hot).	0
6300208257:good_sunday_family_movie:pink_panther	Cary Grant was a Great actor with countless memorable films. Although that this film is not amongst his very best, it is a fun movie with a good plot that may be watch by the whole family with pleasure. It is a war comedy with kids in main roles and one may see some Disney influence. But Grant offers us  one of his typical (in a good sence) perfomance that wilkl satisfy his funs. Enjoy it	1
B0006Q5UQ2:what_a_bargain,_what_a_deal:montiel_a._hancock_"lakeside_reader"	I purchased 2 of these and couldn't be more pleased. Like another reviewer, I gave 4 stars only becuase I've only had them for a few days and don't know how they'll weather. They arrive mostly assembled, and took only about 20 minutes to assemble each set. They look great, and are a comfy place to spend an afternoon.	1

B0000524PD:excellent_product,_but_of_course_it_is_monster:k._jackson_"selective_gamer"	If your a serious gamer and want the best quality money can buy, like me, I would highly suggest this product. Sounds are crystal clear, and fiber optics is the next step up in technology. My first question for you would be, "how much do you invest in your gaming?". Once again, if your like me the answer is a lot. My next question would be "how important is your audio experience?" YOu dont know what your missing out on until you actually experience the difference. Very happy with this product	1
1558605614:a_very_useful,_usable,_and_informative_book:gspitz@aol.com_gabriel_spitz	A great book for every Usability practitioner.  Not only did I find the content of this book very informative and very useful, but in particular I liked the structure of the book and found it extremely usable.  Each  chapter contains context information at the beginning of the chapter, an   out line of the chapter, summary notes on the side bar for quick review,  sample techniques and forms, war stories, estimation of resources required  to complete each step, etc This structure makes the book one of the most  usable books I have ever used, and therefore one of the most useful  companion in designing the user interface	1
70333	This game has StarForce copy protection, which is software that you do not want on your computer. Reportedly, it replaces your CD and/or DVD drivers, and often causes extreme hardware and software problems. I've been a victim of the software problems, it basically crippled my very expensive SCSI scanners and it was extremely difficult to figure out what was doing it. It could be the best game that's ever been produced, but anyone who's had the StarForce experience is going to steer clear	0
B000E0P21I:mostly_happy_with_the_product:m._glynn	I have been using the Graco Snugride since my son was about 2 months old - he's now five months old.  The seat and the base are both easy to install and the seat is easy to adjust and to carry.  As the product name suggests, my son fits snugly and comfortably into the seat.	1
B000K2NKTG:great,_easy_to_use_tax_preparation_software:tendai_mushambi_"mansfield_maverick"	The software is easy to install and easy to use.  The "import prior year's return" feature saved time in completing multiple returns .  I completed one return in 10 mins because of this feature. I also discovered the "save as PDF" feature that made it easier to send tax returns to family and friends whom I prepare returns.  I have used tax cut for the last 4 years and it gets better with each year. The premium federal is great for multiple returns with all kinds of schedules	1
B0007YDES4:too_loud!:s._skidmore	I bought this toy for my son for Christmas.  I thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles.  Unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is SO LOUD!  It scares him everytime I turn it on and there is no way to control the volume.  I know lots of kid toys are loud, but I have never heard one as loud as this one.	0
405335	"Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.	0
167694	I was deeply dissapointed in this lens hood.  Given that the cost is about 10% of the cost of the lens for which it was intended (the 70-300 IS in this case) I expected it to be of stiff durable polycarbonate.	0

I really like the clear window, which I did not have on my previous case, now I can see who is calling and answer my phone without having to take it out of the case every time	1
228643	Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.	1

B000EX3F6Y:what_is_that_smell???_ohhh,_it's_the_diaper_champ.:a._mcghee_"baby_wrangler"	Buy anything.  Buy a regular old trash can and throw your diapers in there because you'll get pretty much the same end result.  I don't have the pink Diaper Champ because I have a little boy but it's still a Diaper Champ and it is horrible.  I had a Diaper Genie with my older son (now 4) and gave it to my brother.  I wanted to try something else and was drawn to the Champ because you can use a kitchen trash bag....woo hoo...NO REFILLS!!!  So for three months now (that's how old my little butterball is now) I've used the Diaper Champ and the first day it's not so bad (maybe because the diapers are floating in the enormous amount of Lysol I spray in there and the fact that I use ForceFlex trash bags (for the prayer that they won't break when I'm disposing of diapers and flood the house with old baby poop) which also have Odor Shield (so the bags start out smelling so nice!) but already by day two, my husband is walking in the nursery saying "HOOOOOOONEY, it smellllllls!  I clean the thing all the time....the stench remains.  This week I ordered my Diaper Genie online.  I feel like throwing a party when it gets here.  I'll spend the extra few dollars on some refills if it keeps guests that enter my home from wondering what on earth died in my house.	0

B000K2NKTG:don't_waste_your_time:r._devinney	H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do	0
B00002MZ6X:disappointed:c._brittsan_"cyberbanite"	I ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons. They were unable to inflate either soccer ball on Christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked. If there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit, I would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready. I had to go out and buy new needles the day after Christmas. We'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump	0

61038	I subscribed to BHG from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year.  The articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine, with its overwhelming amount of advertising, takes away from any good points.

B000HBAHNW:good_but_expensive:brian_h	Apparently 3rd in the hierarchy of 4 models in the new S5 series of Miele vacuum cleaners, the features, price, and accessories are not exactly linear in transition from lower to higher models, nor even across series.  Many of the older series models have more features and a higher price than the newer ones.  They have fancy names like Capricorn, Red Velvet, and Champagne, leading to much confusion and forcing you to compare each one similar to buying a car.  If your browser has tabbed browsing (e.g., Firefox), the best way to figure out which model is best for you is to go to Miele's website and open a tab for each model you're interested in.  Flip back and forth to see what text changes.  Callisto is the cheapest no frills model of the newest series (newest technology motor?) that still comes with an electronically powered brush (the 4th Pisces model is turbo).	1
B0006CTXE6:could_have_been_better,_i_think:jessica_aviles	Well, the fact that I'm writing a review about this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how I'm enjoying this book. This book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. This book is not clear or easy to understand at all. Every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the masses of footnotes together take up half of EACH page (!), making this work look like a research project for a PhD publication. I have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. And it turns to be true! This book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an encyclopedia. Some concepts, which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. It's too complex for a first-year student. Sometimes it starts describing the different views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is. I wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors.	0

274914	My husband and I both love to cook, and some of our new favorites come from this magazine.  The reviews are informative, the recipes taste great (and are not overly complicated), and the basic cooking suggestions are helpful.  The magazine likes to pick a theme for the month (or several) which has a couple of benefits.  1.  You can cook a meal right from one issue and it all tastes great together and 2.  You have several options for one basic idea.  For example one month there was a whole article on rice pilaff which starting with the basics (so you could modify the basic recipe your own way) and then gave several variations.  Best I have found out there so far	1
0816633363:this_is_what_i_hate_about_so_called_"scholars":hey_now	I am reading this for a college course called "History of the American City". This book is a typical 'college texbook' in that it is FILLED with numbers, dates, percentages, figures, numbers, oh did I say numbers, dates, figures, and years, oh and plenty of numbers... The brilliant,dilligent,honored, and esteemed scolar of a  woman that wrote it sure knows her numbers, facts, years, etc... I, on the other hand, am absolutley hating it and foolishly I have allowed the drop date to pass, so I have to read the book or fail the class. I am getting nothing from the book regarding any kind of understanding of any of these cities , unless I am willing to spend years interpreting the multitude of data the book heaps upon me. Needless to say, from (attempting)reading it I am getting a headache and don't really even have the time to write this review. I say that if even one person is deterred from reading this expose' of numbers, names, dates, figures, facts, percentages, orders, years, dates and more numbers, dates, facts, figures (are you getting my drift yet?), it will be time well served though.--- AVOID--- THIS--- BOOK.	0

Such a product just doesn't seem to exist; check the Amazon customer ratings.  I  had one a number of years ago, and it was lousy (had hoped that someone had built a better mousetrap, but no one has!)	1
B000KLNLE6:rick_"shaq"_goldstein_says:_"coco"_is_"ok!"_"ok!":rick_goldstein_"rick_shaq_goldstein"	This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song.  He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till "Jumping Joe" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's "Full Circle"	1

441487	As a white middle-aged male, I always get strange looks from the counter girl when I buy my issue of Black Men. I don't know why though, where else can I do my research? Every white man's dream is a six-foot, big bootied, large breasted, black woman with straight silky hair. It is my dream to marry one. So when I'm cruising the turfs in my pimped out ride, or hip-hoppin' at the club, I gotta have the knowledge I need to hang with whatever ebony queen I have the priviledge of bumping into.	1
B000HLYQNO:great_cable,_charges_too:j._lim	I ordered this cable on December 1st, got it on the 8th. Very quick.  Brand new.  It came with drivers but I didn't need it because I found drivers online.  The cable fit perfectly with my LGVX9900, and to my surprise it charges too.  I use it to put ringtones on it for free :	1
531147	Be advised, this Software is for a SINGLE USER, only licensed for one computer. I bought this for Home use after using SS% for 2 years and V-Com said it would no longer be supported of 03/06. I installed it on 2 home computers, it worked fine for 4 weeks, then it popped up a Box on my second computer that I couls not use it because it was licensed on another computer, I needed to buy additional license for each computer. When I tried to use it on my Main computer, it popped up the same message. So now it will not work on either computer. I uninstalled it and sent it back. Just because it's Cheap does not mean it's any good	0

607033	This was a wonderful game!  Hours of good, solid game play.  An interesting mystery and intriguing characters.  A chance to interact with aquatic life.  I learned how to work a GPS and a HAM radio.  It was so much fun.  The puzzles were a good mix of ability-levels and types.  Word puzzles, spatial puzzles, problem-solving ones.  I can completely recommend this game	1
B000FIAWQO:one_sturdy_garment:suzanne_byrum_"midimaid"	I have owned and worn this for several months now, and it is very durable AND warm as well! I would just be cautious about the unisex sizing, as I am a Medium sized person (10-12) and it does seem to be a little large, yet I wear it anyways.  Hopefully subsequent washings will tone it down in size	1
B00008VU6T:no_stars:juli	First, the adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover to the stroller were inadequate to say the least.  Second, it is opaque, so the kids couldn't even take in their surroundings. Since it resembles a parachute, the only reason that the kids even got fresh air was because the *stupid* thing wouldn't stay attached to the stroller, the kids probably wouldn't have had fresh air. Go for hats and sunscreen/protective garments instead	0

Finally...the puppeteers get to talk about their work and you actually get to see inside the puppet's heads!  Also on DISC 5, they did include the lost footage from the 40th Episode!  BRAVO	1
1740592654:belarus,_huh?:skip_klauber_"a_history_lover"	What to say about Belarus? Well, we spent the day the White Russkis commemmorate the end of WWII there, so I've seen it in all of its "grandeur". Not much to recommend it, go and see Belarus if you missed out on the post WWII East European dictatorships, because Belarus is the last of its kind. A genuine personality cult around the president runs politics, and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970's E. Europe. Guess what- you will not like it. Take some pics of Minsk & move on to Moscow. And if you can find a decent hotel in Minsk, you've done better than my wife and I did.	0
B000JOR0PU:lasted_1_day_or_less:seeker	This is not a good product unless you're willing to screw one of the parts into your door, which we were not since it was a newly installed hi-quality door; and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so.  As a result, the double-backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off.  You can't really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two-sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person (large or small) trying to open the door.  It just isn't going to hold up.	0

B0002JP2OS:boo_hiss_to_criterion_for_ditching_ray_carney_:allan_macinnis	These are great films and the set is lovely. But boo to Criterion anyhow for not sticking up for Cassavetes scholar Ray Carney, whose name was removed from the set after months of work because of his feud with Cassavetes' widow Gena Rowlands. Buy the DVD set, anyhow, you must, but go to the Cassavetes pages, find Carney's links, and read his account of the troubles he's had, trying to preserve and expose people to rare cuts of FACES and SHADOWS he himself tracked down... Sorry to take sides -- Gena Rowlands probably has her own justifications for feeling as she does -- but I greatly admire Carney's contributions to keeping Cassavetes' memory alive and exposing people to his films; he put an amazing amount of work into CASSAVETES ON CASSAVETES, too. It sucks that he kind of got stiffed here.	0
B000KNP62Y:very_good_value:hal	I am pleased with the purchase.  Very good value.  Picture quality is good and it is easy to operate.

Sometimes it's a few drops.  But most times it's like a continuous stream of formula.	0

B0000DBN1G:a_nice_herbal_tea_blend!:snowbrocade	I purchased this tea with scepticism because I am a big rooibus fan--I get organic rooibus tea loose and brew it strong with cream.  In general I think rooibus is a good tea that stands on its own--does not need additions.  However, in this case rooibus was used as a base for a nice clean herbal tea blend.  The flavor of rooibus is just the base note.  Congratulations to Tazo for their light touch with hibiscus--if this tea is brewed properly--4 minutes max--it is light and refreshing.  The touch of rosemary really adds a nice freshness to the blend.  If you brew it too long it does decline into a sourness that overshadows the subltety of the other flavors.  I use this when I want a simple herbal tea with no milk	1

This skirt is lovely, it hides what should never be seen (refer to the 20 pounds above...) and helps create a slimming line. I've worn it with silk blouses, stockings, and high heels and I've worn it with slouchy sweaters, tights, and chunky mary janes -- it works perfectly with both	1

158617	This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.	0
B00021A72I:works_great_with_the_socks:elizabeth_a._borst	This salve is just perfect under Bliss's Softening socks.

It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies	1

B000MSCUJY:great_product_for_medium_distance_runs:s._silver	I just bought the SpeedBelt 2, deciding that the 4 bottle belt would be more cumbersome for me. So far, the 2 bottle belt has worked well for me in the 5-10 mile run range. It fits 2 gels comfortably and 10 ozs of water in each bottle. For longer runs, I'd suggest the 4-bottle belt, but this one is great for the intermediate range. The belt fits comfortably and I didn't feel that it bounced around much at all. Recommended	1
B000FIDJFK:wonderful.:addicted_shopper_"jessica_s"	This is a great Crystal Light product. I like that you get Vitamin C from it. It is a great way to get extra vitamin c with out popping a pill or taking in extra calories. Tastes good too	1
33825	I've been a loyal subscriber since 1998 and have always enjoyed the magazine. Something happened to them in early 2006 - they've either been bought or have hired a new editor / staff or something. This magazine is absolutely terrible now. All ads, fewer and fewer pictures of babes in each issue, and the hilarious articles are now long gone. My last two issues (Sept and Oct) were in the trash within minutes of pulling them from my mailbox. I'm canceling my subscription.	0
B000002O4W:awful:bluecross_boss_"blue"	This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.	0
268344	Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure.

B0000DI9HY:disappointing!:5blessings	We usually love all the Melissa and Doug toys, but these sound puzzles are disappointing.  I bought two for Christmas, the farm one and the vehicle one.  We couldn't open the back to put in the batteries for the vehicle puzzle (as the other reviewer said), and for this farm one, the sound quality is so bad!  The animal sounds aren't even recognizable in some cases.  The puzzle itself is fine, but I wouldn't recommend paying extra for the sound	0
6305428026:&quot;do_they_have_paintings_in_pennsylvania?&quot;:somedumbblonde_"somedumbblonde"	I thought this movie was great!  It's definitely for the more cultured and intillectual movie-goer.  It's probably the best dark comedy I've ever seen (only to rival the masterpiece that is &quot;Heathers&quot;).  The dialog in this movie with leave you with one-liners for years to come.  After seeing &quot;Party Girl&quot; I fell in love with Parker Posey, and when I saw this I loved her even more. This instantly became one of my favorite movies of all time, but then again I'm a huge fan of good dark comedies and I have a sick sense of humor. Everyone I know absolutely loved this move (including my MOM!) In any event, this is a definite must-see for any fan of Parker Posey and dark comedy.  Excellent	1
B00095P17S:best_bronzer_i've_ever_used:michelle888	This is the first bronzer I actually finished. This gives the most natural finish and blends really well. I like that it's matte because I'm not a fan of sparkly bronzer. Ever since I started using this, I'm just addicted and can't live without it. It gives the skin a really natural, healthy-looking flush.	1

395971	DeYoung begins by relating how Bush pushed Powell out at the end of his 1st term, without the courtesy of even personally discussing it with him; making matters worse was the  fact that Bush didn't even know why Powell was at the White House when it came time to say "Good Bye."	1

B000GJU81G:bootie-licious!:living_in_truth_"cindy"	I actually purchased a 9.5 and felt they were a little too big and then ordered a size 9.  The 9 didn't fit well the arch was too short, so I sent them back and kept the 9.5.  They are very nice, I've been looking for a nice pair of boots for 5 years.  I get a lot of compliments, from people of all ages (20-65).  Not too young looking, not too old looking.  They are the perfect boot.  One little negative....I needed to put in a pad for the front part of my foot - not a lot of cushion.  After that I can wear them all day long.  I should have ordered them in brown!!	1

It is simple to install.  Works great.  Is easy to navigate.  And, is actually kind of fun to use.  I love being able to get a small report of my bike ride like average speed, distance, etc.  And, when I'm whipping down the trail I really like to look down and see how fast I'm going or get other statistics without having to stop and push a bunch of buttons	1

It digs deep into industry trends, features portfolios of upcoming industry stars, and is a must for anyone who takes their craft seriously. While the issues are great, their Regional Design Annual is the must-buy issue every year. It really lets you know who the cream of the crop are. Just flipping through it will make you better at what you do (and you'll even stop using hackneyed phrases like &quot;cream of the crop&quot;)	1
435365	This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company	0

82358	Juggernaut was more or less lumped in with the disaster movie genre when it came out in the mid-70s, possibly because the making of the film itself seemed so disastrous. Originally a Bryan Forbes film, Forbes was briefly replaced by Don Medford (who had also briefly taken over The Guns of Navarone after Alexander MacKendrick was fired and before J. Lee Thompson was hired) before Richard Lester took over. While it's easy to spot some of the typical Lester touches (such as poor offscreen jokes added during the dubbing sessions), it's so unlike most of his other films that you constantly find yourself wondering who directed what.	1

B0008IVYIG:first_training_aid:m._martini	I'm a 13 handicap and I've never bought a swing trainer before, but I saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try. It arrived yesterday and I went through the warm-up and practice. First, the grip felt very uncomfortable. Over the years I had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip. This device corrected it immediately, although I didn't know it at the time. After going through the routine described in the directions I went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls. My grip still felt funny, but my tempo, swing path and release had improved 100% in just a few minutes. This morning I went to the driving range. The improvement was dramatic. My iron shots were longer and straighter, but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver. After about ten driver swings I got the hang of it... and... WOW! There's a screen out at 250 yards. On a good shot I usually hit it on one bounce. Today, I was hitting the screen 15 to 20 feet up off the ground.	1

B0002U1TRG:don't_buy_this_seat!!_it_tips_over:chubby_cheaks	I received this seat as a gift for my baby shower, I thought it was going to be a great seat, Graco has been on the market for several years, and it's built up a reputation. But was I wrong! Everytime that I would go out with my newborn, and I would make a turn, the seat would flip over to the side, it did not matter how slow I made the turn it would always do the same thing. I'm a very carefull driver, specially after I gave birth to my son. You can't imagine how horrible it is, to look throuhg the rearview mirror, and see that your tiny little precious bundle of joy, has flipped over and his head is hanging. I would have to look for a place to park, and have to fix him and the seat. I had to move both the passenger and the driver seat as far back as possible, in order to hold the baby seat with the backrest, just so that it wouldn't tip over, and it made it a little difficult to drive.	0

B000K1G9G8:small_and_pretty:doxielover	These earrings are very small, maybe somewhere between 3 and 4mm each. They do appear white, (I don't see any yellow tinting)  with a slight, slight bit of grey, which I prefer over a super white look (as you might sometimes find in a cz). These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and "believably" sparkly look! I also like the fit of the earrings backs, very tight and secure.	1
B000GT47I6:good:scott_"scottwm"	The camera is good. Had it 1 week now. Low light it works and produces fair results. Bright light is much better. Small and light weight. You must use the supplied docking station to transfer as ther is no USB port on camera . There is the  DC in and TV out on camera (as well as the docking station...just no usb...why? ) 30GB hard drive is plenty...maybe too much. If you fill  this up you are looking at 8 DVD's and hours of transfer. The software is weak and conflicts with Roxio 7.5.  Roxio became unusable.  Roxio stinks anyway.  Found a simple program to burn after this...ASHAMPOO. Plan on getting Adobe Premier Elements, too. Amazon had the best deal...89 less 30 mail in rebate from Adobe.  Much better then the software in box.  My first cam as we now have a cute baby.  Easy to keep it rolling and have gigs to save.	1

170104	the wavebird can really take a beating. there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine. plus the game that ip[lay all the time is Super Smash Bros. Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing. I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird. After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery. its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this. but overall its a great controlle	1

The light would go on and off, but there were no sounds at all.  We made sure we had everything plugged in correctly, but it still wouldn't work.  After all the time of putting it together what a disappointment.  I will be calling Fisher Price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to Toyrus.	0
B000A5CL3Y:beautiful_china:frank_yee	My wife wanted two sets to match our new family room decor.  Well, they turned out to be so beautiful that we have replaced our good formal china with this set.

B00009X3YC:spiderman_tent_by_playhut:p._vierik	My son loved this tent.  He fit perfectly in it and it fits inside his crib so he can sleep in his tent.  My only beef with it is that somehow he's bent the frame of it so now it doesn't sit right on the floor.  Actually it doesn't sit on the floor at all because of where it's bent.  The tent would be better made if there were a floor to it and some support (similar to what keeps the top portion rigid) at the base of it to keep the "legs" (there aren't any but that's the best way to describe them) apart.  The tent would also be better constructed if it didn't have one continuous wire for the frame on each side.  If the wire gets bent there's no getting it back into its original shape, unless you take out the stitching (around the WHOLE tent frame) and repair it then restitch it, but who has that kind of time?  Overall it's a fun toy for a little one but not a well thought out build.  I'm glad we got it as a gift and it wasn't something we spent our money on	0

Fun to call out big talkers who don't suspect you are packing a lie detector of sorts. Also useful to get people off your back who think you are too drunk to drive.	1
423364	His singing style is very unique as are his lyrics.  He has an eclectic mix of love songs, "we are the world" type songs and a few others on this album.  He has the staying power for long the long term and I would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes.  I loved Streetcorner Symphony!  It is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me.  Lonely No More is my theme song for right now in my life - needless to say I am replaying grooves in that one!

Ms. London is a wonderful singer, but the producers must have given her sleeping pills.  This is a boring CD!  Like Peggi Blu, who won Star Search, her record company "toned her down" for her debut album, with banal and boring songs with that stupid hip/hop "dum de dum" Mary J.

590006	Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships	0
B000067G10:don't_bother_buying_this_dvd:w._male	I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.	0

B00004U9TI:not_a_great_buy:m._doughty_"duxsmom"	Having had a Hoover in the past, I was excited to find this one at this price.   I've had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again - and WILL NOT be looking at Hoovers.  The parts are plastic and cheap and break easily.  It advertised a power hand tool. It is not. It works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning. The upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months.  The hard wood floor tool worked fine - and suction was strong enough - but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don't stay on like they should, so I spend most of my time with the vacuum re-attaching the pieces.	0

Now she's 4 1/2 months old and she still loves it.  She loves to grab at the fish, shake the rattle and twirl the lobster.  For awhile, it was a whole new toy every week because she would notice something new on it.  Great for putting her down and keeping her entertained while mom grabs a bite to eat.  Also good to take places because of the hard plastic bottom.  Music isn't too annoying either	1

B00007KLJJ:let's_just_say_you_should_not_watch_this_instead_of_reading_the_book.:lindsay_macdonald_"carleton_student"	Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fianc, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne.	0
B000051WDX:the_worst_part_of_being_old_is_rememberin'_when_you_was_young.:a._gyurisin_"good_friend,_damn_fool"	With The Straight Story, Lynch demonstrated none of the recognizable trademarks that transformed him into the director that I love.  This film felt like a "blind date" gone bad.  The Straight Story showed up, David Lynch arrived, but the rest of the date felt muddled, confusing, and utterly disastrous.  Everything in this film seemed wrong.  Lynch's choice for lead actor, the bland Sissy Spacek, the filler of repeat cornfield montages, all the way to the incoherent time spent on the read, I just felt that nobody had control over this picture, yet the randomness (and the possible tear ending) gave critics something to smile about.  This is not a David Lynch film, and for those walking into this with images of Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks, or even Eraserhead in their mind will be utterly discombobulated.  The Straight Story attempted to show us a slice of Americana via the cornfields of Iowa, but for this boy based in the Flatlands of Illinois, it just seemed repetitive and boring.	0

B000235UQY:i_used_to_love_this_product_until_last_weekend.:hamptonshappiness_"hamptonshappiness"	I have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  It used to be a disaster and I was introduced and used Tend Skin for the past two or three years now.  I got a sample of Solution 2 out in the Hamptons last weekend and I could not possibly be happier.  It is a significant improvement over Tend Skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and I have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  It does not sting nearly as much as Tend Skin.  It smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  I used to get very dry patches on my neck from using Tend Skin but I have had no dryness issues with Solution 2.  I used to have a strict regimen using Tend Skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  Now, I roll on the Solution 2 and it's all good:)	0
B000FHFKGW:easy_to_use:carey_a._sakert	Great product that works exactly as described. I have not used this as a stand-alone label maker; I've only used it with my computer. The software is fairly easy to use, and it will pull data from an Excel spreadsheet, which is a definite plus. I had a spreadsheet of over 300 items for which I needed to make labels, and linking to the Excel doc made the process very quick and convenient. The only complaint I have is that the tape for the label maker is rather pricey. I spent $40 on the label maker, and so far I've spent $60 on tape	1

B00006G8H4:perfect_b-grade_fantasy!:jay_knioum	I didn't give this five stars because it's some kind of Oscar-worthy achievement, but if you are a fan of the quirky, B-grade fantasy genre that had its heyday in the late seventies to late eighties, then this film is a must. "Hawk" offers hilarious jump-cut editing, dialogue that is spectacular in its badness, and probably the most memorable elf character ever put to film.	1

B00007IT4Y:a_complete_waste_of_money!_worst_gate_ever!:kerri_powers-hoffman	If I could give it negitive stars I would! We bought two of these gates due to a couple of very wide openings that needed to be secured. These gates are horrible and very poorly designed. Every time someone tries to open the gate, it sags and pulls the wood dowels out of the frame and it completely falls apart! We have older children that have had to resort to crawling over it to get into the living room just to avoid its eminent collapse. And often it collapses anyway. Now my 11 month old son has figured out that if he shakes the gate at the joint he can pull it completely apart and crawl right through. Now we have to purchase new gates that actually work to replace these.	0
B00000EGV7:the_first_feeble_bleatings_of_a_jazz_&quot;purist&quot;:a._kydonieus	I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it.	0

He was so excited to get this his first LMAX cartridge we could barely get the box open fast enough. We popped it in and had to wait until the commercials or very long intro completed. Then we had to blindly navigate through the screens to get to games. They were NOT intuitive and then THUD. He lost interest and has not returned to the LMax since. What an absolute waste of money.	0

After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long	0

107158	I really enjoyed this film, basically the Coen Bros. homage to the film noir genre. (I always thought the name was funny, since it's French, and yet most of famous directors were German, like Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, etc. :-)). The sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool, unhurried, nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey. Thornton is great in the lead as the reticent, phlegmatic barber, and if anything, he is even more convincing with hair than without--even his hairpiece is 50s-ish. :-) The whole cast does a fine job in their roles, and both Gandolfini and Shaloub  have a couple of show-stealing scenes. I found the film's climax a complete surprise, as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber, for whom everything seems to be working out up till then. Overall a great film and probably one of the Coen Bros. best. If you're a Coen Bros. fan you won't find this one a disappointment.	1

Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility	0

B000A7DUK0:at_first..._then_think_again._:l._kim_"poisonivy"	Okay so in the beginning, I was so excited about this perfume.  It smelled AMAZING and the scent lasted FOREVER.  When I say forever, literally forever.  You spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  It lasts until the next afternoon.  It's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  It's like as if you've been spraying it constantly.	0

103083	Please see tj-mccarthy's review elsewhere here; he is, to borrow a phrase from across the pond, spot-on in his comments. Just this week I cancelled my 10-year subscription to PC Magazine. One thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor, Jim Louderback, has dropped the old tagline on the front cover, "An Independent Guide to Technology". I conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is, in fact, just a marketing vehicle for various products. If you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing, stay away from this publication	0
B00000IV4T:jr._soccer/street_hockey_set:k._gordon	This is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play.  My sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken.  The company was nice enough to send a new one out but now (only a few weeks later) the plastic on the goal is shattered.  The goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored.  Overall, I would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play!!	0
B00006WS5F:really_nice_smoker:a_photographer	I have to agree with the previous reviewer who noted the temperature discrepancy.  Items placed closer to the firebox do get MUCH hotter than those on the smokestack end.  This is probably my only complaint about this smoker.  This problem can be moderated somewhat.  You can create a makeshift baffle from aluminum flashing that will help some.  You can also put an aluminum drip pan full of water directly in front of the opening which will not only deflect some of the heat but introduce some humidity into the cooking section.  Personally, I just don't fill it up with meat.  If you're doing several slabs of ribs, use a rib rack at the far end.	1
B000B5ZOXM:plastic_bag.:larry_w._sebert	I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them	0

0007107005:fabulous_book_-_a_must_for_all_levels_of_yoga_practitioner!:a._williams_"obi1"	This book has a wealth of information for any practitioner of yoga, from beginner to advanced.  The content is concise and practical, and the poses are sequenced in a way that allows for a gradual and safe progression in the practice. There are also dozens of practice sequences given for both improvement and how to treat common ailments through yoga.  The introduction is especially valuable, as it offers a no fluff in-depth commentary on the philosophical thought behind the asana practice.  I pick it up again and again and am still referring to it after nearly 15 years of owing it.  My copy is dog eared and loved, and was well worth every penny.	1
219965	I was contemplating on getting the Director's Cut of Gone in 60 Seconds until I looked at the time length.  Usualy a director's ct has more added to it, not taken away.  Believe it or not but the Original; released version of Gone in 60 is 118 minutes long where the Director's Cut release has a minute less footage.  For those that don't care it's not a big thing, but for movie goers, a minute off takes alot away...  Unless you're in it for the new extra features	1

215268	At first I was skeptical about buying an aging McCartney band tour dvd, even though I have every one, so I bought it. I watched it from start to finish. UNBELIEVABLY SUPERB. The lighting, the energy of the band and the crowd, suprising interviews!! and ole Paul looked pretty good for having passed the 64 year mark! After watching it I felt like I had been there. It is the best one I have seen yet! If you like McCartney, this is him at his best not to mention some great songs you will be surprised to hear!	1

0195067711:the_beginning_book_in_science_reform_for_literacy.:k._l_sadler	We have now entered a second time of deep concern for the science, math, and technological education for everyone. The first one occurred after the Sputnik fiasco, when the Russians beat us in the race to reach space. The  concern now has risen due to what science groups such as the American  Association for the Advancement of Science, and educators saw in comparison  of assessments made of students in the U.S. and those in other developed  countries, such as Japan. The answer to this concern was for the AAAS along  with other groups to put out a guideline as to what constitutes scientific  literacy, and what the public in the U.S. should at least know to be  scientifically literate. As usual, though the AAAS addressed the fact that  certain groups in the U.S. were not being 'included' in the pursuit of  science literacy, such as women and racial minorities, in this their first  book they skipped over those of us with disabilities. Since this is a major  concern of mine and the area in which I do research, I was appalled to see  they neglected 'us' once again, especially as the AAAS has a separate  department dealing with the Disabled/Deaf.  In spite of this mistake, the  writing of this book has laid the groundwork for universities and colleges  as to what the teachers they train should know and be able to teach so that  our country can be more scientifically literate. With new information being  made available through newspapers and the Internet on a daily basis, it is  absolutely imperative that all adults regardless of race, gender, or  ability be able to glean the information they need from this outpouring of  information to make decisions requiring informed consent in health care,  decisions on employment (since health care is one of the top employers in  the U.S. today), and to teach their children. This book was the beginning,  but it isn't the end. More books have further elucidated what is required  for science literacy from both the AAAS and other science groups. This is  the place to start if you are an educator of any kind who wants their  students to become scientifically literate.

B0000WZYF4:perfect_fit:kj	The Thule Sidekick was the perfect size - not too big, not too small.  It did not appear clunky-big on top of the car, nor was it too small to fit anything in.

0786242892:wish_i_had_a_sailor/prince_joe_to_call_my_own!:laju	I read this book the first time 7 years back and left a lasting impression on me, that's why when i came across it again after so many years i felt compelled to buy it and read again. Oh Boy am i glad i bought it! Since last time i read it i have read many romance novels, many great one and many bad ones too. i thought i might not like it so much the second time around because of all the exposure i have got to romance novels since then but i was wrong. This book still made my heart race, made me smile at Joe's attempts to make Ronnie laugh and still made me sigh at that sparks of atraction flying between them.	1

B00000INCN:before_the_fall:blockhed_"blockhed"	Kit and Holly are presented in this story by Terrence Malick as total innocents, living in a  prelapsarian state, completely unaware of right and wrong, good and evil, and ignorant of guilt or sin. They have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions; in effect, they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight, and can barely empathise with each other, let alone other people. Things just happen, as Holly sees it. Kit doesn't feel hostility to the people he kills: they are merely in his way. There is no remorse. He is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him. These  kids are like Adam and Eve, with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden, but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death. Holly throws out her sick catfish, showing no feeling. Her dog is shot as a punishment by her father, indicating he, too, is careless of death or pain. Kit stands on a dead cow, as though puzzled by its absence of life. Neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much.  In one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric, animalistic past,  where the younger man simply eliminates the older, in order to secure a mate for himself. Just the way of nature, and beyond criticism.  Apparently, so I've read somewhere, this is the mindset of the criminal, who cannot see what he is doing wrong. He has to get by, somehow, and takes the easiest path. Why work, when you can steal?  If obstacles arise, eliminate them. People are OK, otherwise. Live now, die later. This is an extraordinary film, superbly acted	1

B0001HYMFQ:and_the_plastic_keeps_on_coming:shay_lynn_"shay_in_colorado"	When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded.  Let me see:  a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world's landfills every year.  I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I'd like to admit.  This is totally over the top.   When I've used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes.  It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  So don't anyone else make my mistake	0

B0007NT4MA:awesome_backpack:buckeye	I love my Jansport Odyssey backpack. It has a lot of room and the straps are much more comfortable than any other backpack I have ever owned or tried.  I have a lot of very heavy books and this backpack can't be beaten for tranporting books.  A little more padding in the straps (or smaller textbooks)would make it perfect, but it is still better than anything I have seen out there.  I would highly recommend it to any high school or college student	1

B000AR0LLG:this_is_not_good:j._morehouse	I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.	0
334128	First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.	1

201713	Initially, the 340 was way too sensitive to be even remotely accurate. It did, however, give my wife a good laugh; she was sure that at least 5000 of my 10000 'steps' were registered while sitting perfectly still and clicking the TV remote. But after one week of use, the darn thing became so *in*sensitive that it would only register when I jumped up and down like a pogo stick. Pass on this one	0
B000BFKHCU:cheap_piece_of_junk:r._goldenstein	I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use.  The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of.  Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use.  It was very unwieldy to travel with.  It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable.  Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke.  The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs.  I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average.  Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster.	0

Horribly confusing, doesn't make sense, and I cannot fathom how this would help your clinical practice.  The only redeeming feature is that Excelsior does not let you write in this, so I will have a brand new copy of this for sale to some poor nursing student.  I don't mean to sound harsh, but this book isn't easy to use, it is confusing, and contradicts itself	0
B00006IUTO:filters_in:michael_kerner_"michael_kerner"	I definitely love a cup of freshly brewed coffee. Now that so many choose to have coffee numerous different ways, there are just those who need the right filters. Melita knows that with their coffee filters. They are convient and stronger in hold than any other filters on the market. They work great with #2 coffeemakers, and especially are convient for those who've purchased the individual ground coffeemaker Melita's Perfect Brew and Perfect Start coffee filter cups where all you have to do is just boil water and pour, and you will get a convient cup of coffee. I really recommend Melita a whole lot, they are worth the price.	1

222349	This game, while simple in it's storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square/Enix.  First Square and Enix merge, effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG's of all time (Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy).  Now, we have the perfect pairing of wit, humor, heart and pure Square story.  Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends, your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing.  The chains you can get going in Sora's attacks are amazing.  The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding.  To learn this battle style, you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum.	1
B000LPN9CK:not_worth_it:c._hubert	We bought this item for our son's birthday. We assembled it exactly as shown in the directions.

118260	Consider another receiver before buying Delorme's. Delorme's receiver works only with their software (the receiver does not conform to any standard, unlike most other receivers.) The Delorme software itself is not very accurate. Just in looking at the area of a few blocks surronding my home, I found 3 instances where a facility was shown as being located several blocks from where it actually is - but Microsoft had no problem locating the facilities properly. Finally, with the receiver I have, even after the device as been initialized, Delorme's software sometimes is unable to find it. (I suspect that is because the cable on the GPS side sometimes pulls slightly out, but fiddling with it doesn't seem to accomplish much). Real irritating out on the road, as it is when you find one of their printed atlas has been misbound and lacks several pages	0

These socks keep your feet warm with their wool fiber; and they are very well made and last forever. I especially like the way that they are reinforced at the heel and toe for lots and lots of wear. Oh sure, these socks may cost a bit more--but you get so much use out of them that these socks inevitably pay for themselves.	1

B000E9QSE4:good_if_you're_tall_enough!:a._b._ettman	The Ab Roller was a big disappointment for me. It was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts. Then , once that project was done, I was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least 4 or 5 inches taller than me.

B0001WCX3E:my_9_month_old_goes_ga-ga_over_this_table:a._dube_"loving_mom"	My son has been using this table for the last 3 months and absolutely loves it.  He also has the LeapFrog table, but gets bored with just one.  This table is on the opposite side of our (toy-filled) living room, and he will go over to this for a change of pace.  He loves Elmo and likes to hang on to his head and also mouth it.  He likes to use the phone, which he also mouths - just assume he puts his mouth on everything :) - and also the little bowl under Cookie Monster.  So why four stars and not five?  I do wish the base had a bit more weight to it, but he can easily pull up on it without getting the whole toy over although we've had a couple of near tips.  Also, the toy is a little less educational than I feel it could be since he is always accidentally setting off buttons with his arm...so he could be pressing the triangle with his finger, but his arm could press the Pig...and off Elmo goes oinking and singing about pigs.  Still a great toy, with lots of entertainment value, and as he matures we have less accidental set-offs.  I bought it on sale and it was worth the money	1
B0006Q5602:simply_put_-_does_not_work:ana_y_lat	I read Dr. Karp's book and decided to buy a swaddling blanket.  After doing a lot of research and reading a ton of good reviews on this one, I decided not to spend the $30+shipping on the miracle blanket, but get this instead.  Boy, was that a bad decision.  We tried a few times, and my baby unswaddled herself within seconds!  Granted, we had a big and healthy baby, who was strong, so maybe if your baby is tiny and/or weaker than an average newborn for whatever reason, it might work nicely for a while, but otherwise, don't waste your time with this.  I ended up buying the miracle blanket, and that WORKED!  Do yourself a favor, spend the extra $20 and buy the miracle blanket.  I could have avoided many sleepless nights if I did that earlier	0

B00006IBLQ:best_cloth_to_have_at_the_house:j._garner	I bought this to clean my LCD monitor because fingerprints highly annoy me, but I use it to clean and dust everything around because it does such a great job dry without cleaners or anything and so it takes just a few seconds.  Cleans lenses, monitors, surfaces, etc. with no scratches.  It really holds on to dust and dirt.  Wash it every once in a while, especially if you clean up particularly abrasive dust for some reason.  Shaking it out outside works fairly well for regular dust, too, and lets you know how effective the thing is	1

That this kind of tuneless twanging should be mentioned in the same breath as anything by Kottke or Fahey (or Peter Lang) is puzzling to say the least. But, credit where credit's due: it's not easy to make an acoustic guitar sound this unpleasant	0
503112	This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!	0

B00005YXWD:not_like_the_old_lite-brite!!:silklocks	This lite-Brite is a piece of junk! Don't wast your money! Maybe if I weren't comparing it to the older one I would think it was ok but even then I am not sure. I loved my lite-brite as a kid and wanted to get my daughter one so she could have as much fun as I did with mine.This has not left the box since the first day. First all of the screens where you stick the pegs are white not black like the old one so without the refill sheets it is useless.Also without the refill sheets the pegs are too big and they do not stay in.This was very frustrating! Even with the sheets sometimes they still fall out! I am really unhappy with this purchase and I can usually find something about a toy I like but not this one. I just didn't want anyone to be deceived into thinking that the screens were black and you could  make your own "art"	0

B00068TK84:very_nice_watch,_if_you_don't_mind_the_weight:j._geddie	This is a sleek, sharp, quality watch, and the lowest priced model that I've seen in the arctura series. If you can catch it on sale, I think its a great buy. However, be prepared for the weight. This is the heaviest watch I've ever worn, and probably the largest. If you're used to wearing stainless watches, it will probably be fine for you. I'm used to leather bands, and the weight difference is quite noticeable. Wish I could find this watch in titanium, that would be perfect. Overall, if you're not bothered by the large size or weight, it looks great, and I'm sure the quality is also.	1
149879	I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.

281933	We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first	1
47542	I purchased dvd express and it never worked. I spent endless time with tech support. The old story about, "It must be your computer." did not fly either, my machine is a media type and it far exceeds the system requirements advertised by ADS. I exchanged the item and it was supposedly checked out before I got it. Same problems. Tech support told me I was the only person having trouble with this product. They need to check out a few websites that review products there are hundreds of bad reviews very few good ones. My only mistake was not reading them before I wasted my time and money. ADS also told me it would not work with Ulead's Movie Factory 3, some of the software it came bundled with, but that was Uleads problem. I should use Cap Wiz ( Their program ) DUH!!! Guess what, it did not work with their program either. Ulead said they had several complaints with ADS's product. Their final solution hold on to the product and maybe they will have a new version of cap wiz and that might work. Save yourself time money and aggravation buy another product! P.S. Since ADS doesn't consider the product defective they will not refund your money or allow you trade it in for an upgrade. I don't think they want a product like that either. The only reason I gave one star is.....it was packed well.	0
B00006L0D8:if_i_could_i'd_give_-10_stars...:	What is it with these gossip magazines?? Please tell me, because I truly think NO ONE in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage. All it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds, while not having anything important else in the magazine. Unless your 10 years old, do NOT subscribe to this. There are better magazines out there fortunately, like Seventeen and CosmoGIRL! which aren't nearly as filled with garbage like this. The reason you don't see J-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people, it's for little kids and it's not mature. PERIOD.	0

B000EQ9LM8:beware_if_you_have_allergies:p._matthews	I bought the entire line of products from the Lisa's Hair Regimen on the Carol's daughter website. I took all the products back to Sephora yesterday. I used this Hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. I washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. I wear my hair natural and I had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. When I took the product back to Sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was RED w/ white spots all throughout it. I had to take OTC pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. The only thing I can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. The product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. If you have allergies to these items I would suggest not using this product. I contacted Carol's Daughter and have not heard back from them yet. I would have expected more from the company who's product states 'Made with Love, Peace'.	0
B000JBXH8W:draws_deeply_from_the_well_of_man's_most_instinctual_fears:daniel_jolley_"darkgenius"	Truth be told, I should probably give this film only four stars because it does take a while to really get going and I think some of the story elements could have been presented more effectively.  When this thing gets going, though, The Descent easily attains not-to-be-missed status, and on top of all the incredible special effects, oppressive atmosphere, and grievous bloodletting (made with a pretty limited budget, by the way), one of the most important plot points of the story is actually brought home in an impressively subtle manner.  Are you kidding me?  Blood, gore, a claustrophobic atmosphere like you wouldn't believe - and subtlety?  How could I not give The Descent five stars?	1
385811	I bought this over 6 months ago from an Asian food store. It is so good! It's really cool how the rice paper melts in your mouth. I gave some to my little cousins and they loved it. It's a wonderful thing to suck on and it's not very sticky either. It also comes with a sticker or a tatoo.	1

60559	John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.	0
449256	I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.	0
0307339424:there_was_a_reason_it_was_in_the_3_for_2_section_in_borders:alexander_m._moir_"lt._moir"	What could have been a hilarious, informative account of breaking outlandish old-fashioned laws and getting (or not getting) in trouble for them turns out to be no more than the story of a couple of clueless young British guys (I think the author is around 23) wryly making fun of America's perceived backwardness. Sometimes it just seemed like they were trying to do things and, when they couldn't, they outright gave up on some great chances. The Swedish girls in Frisco: WHY include it if it didn't come to fruition and, furthermore, involved no lawbreaking??? I'm still wondering why they included their 2-page tour of Hearst Castle when it was little more than a miniscule travel log (cool, Hearst had Greco-Roman statues in his poolroom).	0
B000KERWB6:worst_customer_service_in_the_world:steven_clark	We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!	0
B0009F8RAQ:cindy's_back_must_hurt:dulcinea_del_toboso_"emarey"	When my daughter was tiny, she enjoyed being in this sling... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes. The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose.	0

B0007D63OC:awesome_product!!:margaret_mccullough_"margaret"	I love this little cutter!  The base is only 6" wide so it's perfect for traveling.  The orange part of the handle and the measuring arm both store under the unit.  The key to using this cutter properly is to hold your paper securely with the orange paper guard, which is attached to the top of the cutter.  The only downside to the cutter is when you have to cut at a specific place or around a text box; it's difficult to see where you're cutting unless you have a light source under the cutting edge.  Otherwise, I would suggest it to anyone	1

The stupid pieces don't fit together right and so if you move it,  you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart.   AND the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it's really hard to turn it.

B000HGONJQ:unsure:heather_j._weiss	I have to be honest.  I bought in to all the hype of mineral make-ups.  My sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like I do.  I didn't want to pay the price or join the club so I tried Pur MInerals.  I still had to use a "cover-up" under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the "flawless" look.  But then it looked too powdery.  I started using my regular cover-girl foundation and powder again as I felt it covered better and less heavy.  Just a note, my sister said she still uses a "Cover up stick" when using bare essentials too, but she looked beautiful in it	0
472885	This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!	1

B000B90G9K:unsafe_product:r._hubbell	I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child	0

B000FIJQI4:simply._._._beautiful!_:elizabeth_munoz_"...love_is_digital...baby_-bjork-"	I purchased this Bulova watch as a Christmans gift for myself, this past christmas '06. I have a small watch collection & I hadn't really bought such an elegant watch before, so I decided why not? Specially when I researched the price on how much I would save by buying it on Amazon.  By looking at the pics on Amazon it looked so nice, but when I received it  was the most BEAUTIFUL watch I had seen or owned. The diamond bezel is just right it isn't to much glitz nor is it too little, the diamonds are just right & amazing they sparkle so beautifully against the chronograph face & the stainless steel band. The watch itself is a little heavy compared to other watches I own so it is definitely sturdy & above all just a well made timepiece that I am sure will be, not just in my collection but on my wrist for years to come.	1
0785731261:the_best:gene_venable	This is the best review of the JFK assassination that I have seen. There is still a large "assassination industry," which can afford to find documents that you haven't read and charge you with ignorance if you haven't read them, and find 15 more if you read them. This gives a common-sense overview that seems quite reasonable. I trust it. I am always willing to consider other opinions, but the balance of evidence has always indicated that Oswald acted alone.	1
B000AON0Q2:heaven_for_your_feet:d._s._bornus	Once while traveling, I had a big blister on my heel and needed something that wouldn't rub my heel. I happened to get a pair of Crocs since the strap can be moved forward to look like trim over the front. I was pleasantly surprised by the Crocs - very cushiony soft, like walking on air. Also the material is insulating enough to keep your feet warm yet the air holes ventilate enough that your feet don't get sweaty either.	1
B0000BXHL1:turkeys_beware_-_we_are_ready_for_you!:ladyluck5_"ladyluck5"	THIS TURKEY FRYER WAS A SUPERB PRICE COMPARED TO THE STORES- IT WAS DELIVERED RIGHT TO MY DOOR ON NEXT DAY SERVICE AND THE TURKEYS CAME OUT JUICY, TASTY AND I WAS TOLD TO NEVER USE AN OVEN AGAIN. IT ALSO MADE CORN ON THE COB, CAPONS, VEGGIES AND ZEPPOLES SO EASY AND SO TASTY.  i SET IT UP TO MY BARBEQUE GAS CONNECTION AND VOILA` IT FEELS LIKE MY KITCHEN WAS EXTENDED ONTO THE PATIO.  GREAT IDEA AND THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR SERVICE	1
B0000CCW1N:found_something_better:bette_hampton_"b.h."	Tried this product for 2 weeks; it did improve the clarity and softness, but I found the product to be too scratchy and it did not rinse off well, seemed to have a sticky feel.  Since then, I found a wonderful microdermabrasion product called Microdermx by Nikkel Holistic Skincare. This product performs like magic; it is not too scratchy and I can do a whole microderm treatment and not end up feeling like I've been slapped with a wire brush.  I can do the treatment 2-3x's a week, (like your supposed to) but I also use it each morning as a cleanser and everyday is better than the day before. It is a magical product.	0

B00088O00U:recommended:	This book provides fascinating details of what life was like for children in Colonial America: How they played, what their education was like, what they wore, etc. The information is drawn from such primary sources as letters, journals and school primers. There are a number of pictures as well. I recommend it	1

B0000AY9XY:stylish_and_durable,_with_a_horrible_leaking_problem:todd_g._anderson	I have three kids, and for the third time, I am utterly dissapointed with Avent's product.  With each new child, we bought a fresh supply of bottles, hoping Avent had fixed this problem.  We really wanted these bottles to work, as they seem to be the most durable and stylish ones on the market, and our kids never had any problems with the nipples.  However, each time, we ended up having to switch to another brand.	0

B000I2UJ0Q:worth_it's_weight_in_gold._my_son's_favorite_toy!:arcelia_hayes_"mother_of_one"	This jumper is worth it's weight in gold. My son is 3 1/2 months old and beginning to hold his head up so I decided this would be a great upright toy to start him out on since he loves to be in motion. At first he was a little wobbly, but after placing a pillow under him he is moving all around. I have never heard him coo and giggle as much as he does while in this jumper. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a jumper. I am so grateful to have found such a wonderful product that brings my son so much joy	1
B000C7QYN8:awesome_wipes!:sr	These wipes are strong, have just the right amount of moisture, and don't leave that slimy feeling that most of the major brands leave. My son had diaper rashes as a newborn; when we were at home, we could wash/rinse him with water and dry completely before rediapering, but when we were out, and had to use wipes, his rash would flare up. After switching to these wipes and 7th Gen diapers, the rash went away. Later on, I tried Pampers again, and the rash came back. Using Seventh Gen really has kept his skin rash free. My older son also has a lot of itching when we use Pampers; much less with these wipes & diapers	1

Plenty of room for his laptop and pens, notebooks, extra books, etc.  Very durable, highly recommend	1
B000AU1E50:dr._tms:t._m._sell_"dr._tms"	Not worth the high price.  Difficult to clean and very persnickety.  Comes with a bunch of sensors that, if not properly triggered, keep it from roasting.  Not long after I bought it, I couldn't get it to start without jamming a pencil in one spot, and now it doesn't work at all.  When it works, it works fine, but it doesn't always work nor does it last very long.	0
B00005A3L5:best_buy_yet!!_worth_every_cent_in_finding_hidden_treasures:lahudgins23_"lahudgins23"	We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long	1

B00076SKZY:doesn't_cover_entire_toilet_seat,_weak,_flimsy.:ameliabedelia	I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart.  It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat.  It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back.  The result is that there is no support in the back.  My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her.  Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back.  I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in.  She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much.  I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else	0

However, I can't really recommend them due to their high prices. If you can find the Microsoft HD pack, get that as it's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable. The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length (10 feet) which can go from one side of my entertainment center (where the xbox is) to the other side (where the stereo receiver is	1

Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green	1
B000246MNS:terrible_disappointment:keeper@home	My son received this as a Christmas gift. He and his brother and Dad were excited...got all set up to build it...and got nothing but frustration! These are really mechanically minded guys too. Very disappointing. I was especially surprised because of the Smithsonian name on it -- you'd think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it. My guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled. The screws stripped and we didn't have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue. It simply would not assemble the way it was advertised. I am calling Amazon tomorrow about a refund.	0
342502	I purchased the 2GB Elite Pro SD card but found out that my older SimpleTech FlashLink card reader is not able to recognize the card under WinXP SP2 with and without the most recent SimpleTech drivers. I don't have another card reader for my computer, but the pictures recorded on it by my digital camera can be viewed on my PDA so I assume that it's the card reader. Shortly afterwards, I also discovered that Kingston makes a combo kit that includes their USB 2.0 SD/MMC reader for a bit less in price than the card alone.	1
47989	I have gone from the old 640x480 about nine years ago to a 3.1m for the last few years to the Canon 20d now, what a pleasure to shot. The battery life has not been an issue even with over 250 shots, which should be sufficient for most anybody. There is a small learning curve but you would expect this with any new camera.	1
335267	I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now	1
339292	As he did with "Parade", the soundtrack to his last vanity project "Under the Cherry Moon", Prince provides a musically invigorating soundtrack to "Graffiti Bridge", which is a hopelessly silly film. No matter. "Graffiti Bridge", Prince's first album of the 90's, is also one of Prince's best albums of the 90's.	1
196273	I read Scientific American occassionally back in the 80's. At that time I found the articles (especially the physics articles, which I love) to be especially dense and poorly supported by graphics. The quality was there but it didn't quite get across to my younger self.	1

B0009S4US6:great_toybox:bookworm	We got this toybox for our daughter when she turned one.  We love that it doesn't have any sharp corners or hinges to get fingers stuck inside.  It still looks like new 6 month later so it is very durable. If your child likes to get inside it like ours does there is no worry about them breaking it since the bottom is fabric.  We also really like the pockets in front for storing smaller items- we always stick her favorite dolls and animals in there.  We don't use the cover so that she can get the toys herself and it works perfect for us.  Highly recommend!	1

B0002UEDUG:don't_buy!__waste_of_money!:aaron_j._cloward_"simpleutahboi"	This is a complete joke.  The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection.  And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps?  Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest.  If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program.	0

597145	This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.	0

B0000CNXRK:never_loose_time:jillolli	I have had this for 1 month now and I love it. It does record the outdoor and indoor temp. You can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock. We had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night (also great!) and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser. Both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp. Never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time. It is updated every 24 hours. I Love it	1

B000O6XE12:_my_new_helmet_light:kent_peterson_"kent_peterson"	LED headlights are getting better all the time. This little guy is a one Watt Luxeon LED with very good power regulation. Regulation means that the light gets the most from a set of batteries and keeps the light at a given brightness instead of dimming as the batteries weaken. The Princeton Tec EOS has three brightness settings and a flash mode. I actually find the flash mode to be too slow to be useful on the bike and it flashes at full power but these are minor nits. I'd also prefer if the light used AA instead of AAA cells. So I guess there are two things I don't like about this light.	1

The barcode sticker failed to come off in one piece and I ended ripping off some of the finish of the burgundy version of this bokken.

B0008G1OOM:happy_with_century_gloves:h._meyers	I take a Ringside Boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them.  I ordered them from online because it was the only place I could find a size small.  I am very happy with them.  They offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers.  I really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist.  They do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them, but it washes right off.  The only thing bad I have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them, the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger.  It can be sewed up, but you shouldn't have to do that so soon after the purchase.  No one else in my class seems to have had this problem.  I still gave them 4 stars, because I have a hunch that the threading isn't a common problem and I love them otherwise	1

B0002EWSSG:fossil_not_living_up_to_my_expectations:s._kitten_"vet_tech"	I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed	0

B000FEIO72:lives_up_to_its_name:kasia	After suffering from a terrible cold all week I finally succumbed to a hot bath. I had to rummage through my box filled with Lush products ( gift from a thoughtful boyfriend) when I pulled out this huge disc and broke out half while saving the other for one more bath. I didn't even know what this was called but the minute it touched the water, refreshing and invigorating essences of lemons and milky cream escaped my nose, I felt happy in an instant, it was amazing! Even thought my nose refused to recognize scent for days I smelled the oils and citrusy botanicals, the bath water filled with tiny bubbles and I soaked my cold and stress away.	1

B0007XS0U2:it_didn't_work_for_me:athair	Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.	0
B000FAR364:bless_my_soles:john_p._morgan_"light_coach"	I own lots of shoes...but I don't wear them...truth be told, I detest having things on my feet. I somehow think that if my feet are being smothered than somehow in some way, my spirit...my soul is also being somthered. But if I am in a suituation where I have to have something on my feet, I reach for my "Birks". Now if you have never owned a pair, you are to still call them Birkenstocks because only the people who own them are allowed to call them Birks. Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them "Birks" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.	1

B000F70OZ4:too_close_to_sell_by_date:munchies_organic	The sell by date on a package was less than a month.  So that they would not go bad, I felt like I needed to personally eat more than I would have.  I have a retail store and I need a bit more time on new products.  This was a costly mistake.  Also, the "wholesale price" from the business itself was the same as Amazon's price except Amazon gave free shipping AND a discount coupon worth ten bucks!  Cool deal beans Amazon!  As a retailer, I would think that I would be able to get a better deal from Betty Lou's or get a reasonable sell by date.  Very tasty and addicting	0

B00023JJGG:great_toy_(if_you_can_put_it_together):lou	This playset is great - my son loves it.  You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off.  My only complaint was puting it together.  The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures.  The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle.  Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help.  Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic	1

B000BKY9GU:easy_interface,_bad_product:james_scott_falcone_"sfliny"	I recently purchased this bluetooth Scala-500 and used it all about maybe 5 times.  Why such a short amount of time?  Because the sound quality heard on the other end is so poor that I am told it sounds like I am in a windy tunnel when in fact I am in the car with the windows up and radio off.  It's a bit too hot to drive with air condition off and windows up just so the person on  the other end can hear me.  Now I keep this piece of junk in my console and will only use it if my Logitech bluetooth is out of power.  If you buy this make sure you plan to use it in a place like a library where there are no sounds at all to interfere.  The only good thing about this headset is that it was easy to setup and connects well with my cell phone.  Think twice about buying this product or check it out at your local retailer first.  Even with the rebate I only paid $[...], but still not a bargain.  The one star was for the ease of setting up with my cell phone	0

B000005HA9:for_all_lovers_of_true_flamenco:r._webb_"rbw2001"	With all the 'Neuvo Flamenco' and its accompaning popularity. It is nice (and a relief) I might add, to hear the flamenco guitar in its purist form. Not only does this cd contain Sabicas and Nino Ricardo. It also contains four very rare perfomances by Manolo de Huelva. Which are difficult to find anywhere. Also included are Melchor de Marchena performing six pieces. This is truly Pure Flamenco at its best	1
B000HC0BJG:mine_was_faulty_and_some_other_notes:e._weatherbee	Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary???????	0

B000FBQWLU:no_stars:n._painter	I ordered enough Stevia packets to last me for 1 year. Most of the packets have the sugar hardened.  Every so often I am finding one that is powder as it should be.

B0000ZU74E:don't_bother!:christiaan_havelaar	Total rubbish. Wood was scratched on top, corner was smashed, water damage on the shelf, and door was cracked. It is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use. The holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together. Extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control. To add salt in the wound, the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and I had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it. If you like taking chances and do still want to buy it, it's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged.	0

452668	Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades.  Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program:  "Programa Medicina en Comunidad", just like in the film!!!!   It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh.	1
B00083HIW2:mixed_feelings_about_it:mom_of_two_"crystal"	As in my title I have mixed feelings about this toy. My children both have the original color version of the VideNow. I thought I would upgrade them to the newer version. They have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well. In fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in. There is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't accidently turn off while watching. But it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often. I can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it just gets left on! I am very dissapointed in this. The kids really enjoyed their Color versions and I feel I shouldn't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. However, even with it's faults my kids still enjoy them. My kids don't watch a lot of TV and prefer the shorter pvds to the long Dvds. I prefer that too. That way I can say they can watch one show and know they won't be watching for an hour or more. If you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it. If your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you	0

GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED.	0
235321	I did not find this book very helpful. There is an entire chapter dedicated to which expensive pots are the best to &quot;invest&quot; in (it seems the pricier the better, and I mean several hundred dollars, I  actually went to stores and priced the recommended brands) and what kind of  fancy kitchen gadgets are needed to create gourmet meals.  I am not a  professional chef, just a simple housewife that enjoys preparing simple,  good-tasting meals for my family, the recipes here seem to be  time-consuming and complicated.  Not much money to be saved here	0

B0001D12XA:way_too_difficult_to_be_portable_and_poor_sleeping_surface:s._reyes	I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag."  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!	0
151594	(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.	1
159722023X:unholy_fun!:mandy	This is Ann Waldron's best McLeod Dulaney mystery yet. The characters are so lively and well-drawn they literally walk right off the page (and, in some cases, right into your heart). The setting--the Princeton Theological Seminary--is perfect (a perfect place for a murder, that is), and the plot is downright diabolical. Are you in the mood for some humorous, mysterious and sinfully well-written fun? Then do yourself a favor and read this delightful book	1

B000800B6U:trigger_finger_alowa_you_total_control_of_your_drums:robert_h._cooper	Unlike the first reviewer my experience with Trigger Finer has been a good one. At first it took me awhile to figure out how to get the device to control the drums in Impulse (Ableton Live) once I realized that each pad had to be set in order to have each tone mapped it was a breeeze. I suspect that maybe the first reviewer as well as any midi newbie might have difficulty in that respects since it is not plug in play as M Audio states....it is program and play, however once you get it programmed correctly it is effortless. The htinkg is it is soo expandable and programmable it may be to its own detriment especaiily for peolle who are not fimiliar with mapping out midi controllers	1

34744	I was one of those that never got a chance to sit down during the live broadcast to watch Live 8 and certainly regretted that. However, I was fortunate enough to find this copy at Amazon and it's been everything I had expected and more.

I would highly recommend this box set to any music fan from any generation--truly a "must have" for anyone's collection!	1
245056	The thing I hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section. Supposedly, they're written by real people. But after reading this magazine for the last few years, these letters all seem to have the same maudlin, soporific, sappy style of prose that reads to me like they've been EDITED that way. There's this condescending "athletes are supposed to behave like GOOD ladies and gentlemen and if they don't, then tsk tsk - WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN THINK?" mentality that I absolutely HATE. The good things about SI are the photography and whatever articles on the NBA they have any given week. And the swimsuit issue? I guess if you're a 13-14 year old it's exciting as all get out - I'll take the HARD STUFF any day over their annual fleshfest	0

B0009ACZMW:wonderful_video!:f._parker	I was like the previous reviewer.  I had rented it and after watching it the first time, purchased it before I had even returned the rental!  I loved the content, it gives one hope and a small glimpse into what lies beyond our human experience.  How lovely to know that there is a life we can barely imagine, waiting to be returned to.  And I didn't learn this fact from the video, I have been studying this subject for many years and already believe, no I KNOW, that there is more that lies beyond this brief stay on Earth.	1
524767	This one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.  The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best.   The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt.  The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie.  I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.  The loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  It is well worth your time and money.	1

1844281825:resonably_okay.....:annmmar_"asmb"	Margaux with an x is about a young lady who seems to have it all. Beauty,Popularity and can do about anything without getting into trouble at home. Yet she is not happy she holds a dark secret that happened to her when she was young.She is tired of every boy drooling over her and wanting to date her and most having no content to them.  She has a gambler as a father and a mother who just watches television all day. Her life takes a different turn when she meets Danny. He is the total opposite of all the guys she has dated. He is a year behind her in high school he is thin and is not shapely, yet they both start a bond with each other. The book was interesting but after awhile I got tired and could not keep up with the constant bantering and sarcasm of the main characters	0

405169	This magazine transports you to a different world.  Every issue is a wish-book, with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month, or crafts to do over your next long weekend, or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room.  Well, in my life, years go by and I dream on.  But just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped, negative, angry thoughts.  I will never laugh at "crafty" people again.  I will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside, but the dreams are sweet.	1
B000H227N4:"great_workout":b._jones_"barbara"	I just love this workout, it really gets you sweating. It's a great workout for beginners as well, not too fast or complicated. I just started working out with The Firm System, and plan to use it to get back into shape. You can always purchase more DVD's to keep you motivated. I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape.	1

B000063KBV:great_for_learning_about_horses!:debbie_t.	My daughter has been riding for about 3 years now and she was so excited to see this Christmas morning.  Of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play.  Her grandma and I played and I was surprised at the amount of things I have learned just from taking her to her lessons!  I'm sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like Trivial Persuit but that was my only problem with the game.  There isn't questions asked every move.  But otherwise, it is an excellent game.  I would definately recommend it	1
B0007TR9BC:after_one_month's_use:william_r._hale	I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far	1
B000FMZE7W:alternate_pick_to_ipod:daniel_b._spencer	I was programming an Ipod for a friend and became interested in buying one for myself.  I went to the store to get some info on the Ipod, and luckily the departments store I frequent didn't carry the unit, but offered the Zune.  I came straight home, did my reasearch, and ordered on the same day.  The Zune is far more superior than any Ipod model that I have either read about or experienced for myself.  And a much better deal moneywise.  I must say that you shouldn't get a Zune unless you are running a Windows version with SP2 or higher, for any other ver. won't recognize the unit.  I had a pc w/SP1 and Media Center 2002, so I thought I was in trouble.  Against my initial thoughts on SP2, I went ahead and upgraded, and haven't had any problems yet.  The sound is great, videos are decent, and the software is very user friendly.  I would check out the other models of media players, especially the Archos brand, for they have a bigger screen and hard drive.  But for audio and a few videos, this unit is worth the money	1
B000ASBMAY:awesome_for_20_bucks:j._ream	Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too	1
1406944734:a_mess,_and_not_a_very_agreeable_one--_and_yet...:mark_h._teeter_"a_reader"	What is remarkable about this onetime best-selling book -- which could well be described as a coming-of-age-without-coming-of-age novel -- is not that Fitzgerald produced it when he was all of 24.  Nope, the amazing thing here is that the same writer produced "The Great Gatsby" a mere five years later.	0
334037	Has insightful articles about what's hot in the business world.  Great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich.  Honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader.  I would agree with one of the reviewers, however, that it tends to go off course.  It has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to	1

B0001EJIXK:silica_gel_-_good_value:s._krause	This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container.  The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer's instructions and baking in an oven.  the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers, however larger spaces may require more than one.  Overall, this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container(s).  I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted	1
96649	Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.	1
B00004RBEE:weber_stainless_replacement_cooking_grates:a._dangelo	Living in Florida, we grill almost daily. I seem to burn out a set of enamel grates every 15 months or so. Hopefully, the stainless grates will last much longer.	1
B000FLJNMA:cute_and_very_comfortable:punkiesmama	I got so many compliments on these shoes the first time I wore them to work. They are very pretty and preppy looking. I wore them with slacks and a matching cable knit sweater. The green is very bright, so they don't match everything, but it's a standout accessory. Wore them without socks and had no blisters	1
B000B6JAR2:why_not_make_it_fun!?_:h._willard	I have every single (that I know of) Math Blaster game out there. My kids love them all. I saw this one and couldn't resist buying it. My 12, 10, and 7 year-olds all play this version. (It's too simple for the 12 year old, but he plays as a reward for piano practice - so I'm not too concerned about his refreshing earlier math skills.) My thought it to have each child play the grade level above theirs, and that's ususally right where they're at. Yes, there are a few annoying glitches in the way some of the characters can and cannot move around (I don't play them myself to know well) but I would hope that children are not so whiny that it matters too much. I think every family should have Math Blaster Geometry, Algebra, and all grade levels. If you can make math fun, and use it as a POSITIVE REWARD...that is called a "win win"! :	1

I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!	1
80915	I subscribed to Food &amp; Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to &quot;Bon Appetit&quot; or &quot;Gourmet&quot;	0

B00009NRPL:don't_waste_you_money.:p._gueldner	We purchased this purcolator for Christmas 2003.  Every other pot is weaker than tea, many grounds are left in the bottom of the pot.

I am returning the pot and purchasing a Farberware for half the price	0

B000001GXY:great_cds:john	The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended	1
0553263218:online_review_by_braxton_kari_:	I read The Pig Man by Paul Zindel for a summer vacation assignment. In all, I do not enjoy reading books , but I was surprised by the humor in this book.

B0006IM2HA:exactly_what_i've_been_looking_for:a._white_"drted"	The knots in my back - my "spots" never really go away due to posture and my work in front of the computer.  One day I asked a coworker what the odd green thing by his desk was.  He explained the concept, I tried it for about two seconds and immediately knew this was something special.   The leverage is perfect for zeroing in on your back knots and applying STRONG pressure to them - like having a strong friend digging their knuckle in and holding it there.  I bought one the next day.  You don't need an expensive vibrating massage wand that has all sorts of silly features - just this simple stick that can pinpoint and dissolve all your stress spots.	1
B000F6SQ1E:better_thank_starbucks!:nancy_pm	These are great! Very smooth and yummy.  The only thing is I think they are a little to sweet for me.  I just add a little more coffee and a tad of milk, then they're perfect!	1
384707	I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South	1
B0001UZZOU:pure_genius!!:p.b._mckiski	Git-r-done is a nonstop display of a brilliant comedic genius known as Larry the cable guy. Larry never ceases to pull off witty punchlines that at first go over your head, but end up doubling you over with laughter. His preformance will definitely torque your brain, so be prepared. There are a couple instances where Larry goes a little too far and really flexes his mental might leaving you feeling fragile and insecure. One such occurance is his bit about grandma farting like a machine gun. I was left very confused and uncertain of myself until it dawned on me that Larry was just messing with me because we all know girls don't fart, they don't even have buttholes. He then tries to pull a fast one when he proclaims he never works out EVER. Unless you are an idiot, you know you can't look like him without a strict training regiment, nice try Larry. He finally sounds off with an insightful and powerful anti-Hillary Clinton piece. This was the icing on the cake for me because when I think of intelligent political commentary, I think Larry the cable guy!!!!	0
B000067UXF:tried_to_like_it...:artsymom	But after ordering it twice from Amazon, and having both arrive either defective or damaged, I give up on this stroller. First one arrived and it turned out after assembly that the front fork was funky - one side longer than the other - therefore making it impossible for the wheel to sit correctly. So we returned it to Amazon and were sent a new one. It arrived in a horribly damaged box but we put it together anyway...put my almost 3 year old and 2 month old in it and tried it. Veered to the right, and after close inspection, once again we noticed that the front fork was messed up, probably during shipping. Also my 2 1/2 year old's head was brushing the top of the canopy and this stroller is VERY heavy and hard to turn. (yes I knew the front wheel would be fixed and had anticipated having to lift it to turn, etc.)	0

196301	I heard the first Beat LP (&quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;) in a small town record shop in 1980 and instantly fell in love with this band's brand of ska/soul/rock.  For some strange reason, I never bought &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; and never got familiar with it.  I confess to reading some less than enthusiastic reviews and shying away.  Of course, I did buy &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; and found it to be par excellent.  So I ordered &quot;Wha'ppen&quot; a couple of months ago and it arrived a few weeks back and I've been wearing it out.  Damn!  How did I miss this?  This is a great collection of snaky sweet, politically smart songs.  &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot;... I've loved that song for years... and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot; has always been a favorite.  But every other single song on this CD, including the bonus tracks, is outstanding.  These songs are textural wonders.  Great stinging guitar work and the incredible Saxa on his horn make this a stunning recording.  I regret not discovering it sooner, but it sure is a nice find after-the-fact.  Oh yeah... one more thing... I had the pleasure of meeting Dave Wakeling in Nashville this past summer and he's a very nice fellow who cares about the people that support him.  If he comes to a venue near you, don't miss the show.  You'll get your money's worth and more.  Wear your dancin' shoes.  He is truly one of the great talents of the 80's and continues to make significant music.  He may be the most underrated recording artist of the past two decades.  Buy this CD.  You won't regret it. It sounds best in the early evening.  I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go	1
B00021PUE8:a_great_birthday_present:ruth_hansen	We got this as an 11th birthday present for one of my daughter's friends.  It was the hit of the birthday party -- all the girls went home with new yarn belts, and my daughter, who can already knit a little, asked if she could have one, too.  The colors of yarn are bright and the texture is easy to work with.  For our purposes, this was a great birthday present	1
B000144R90:worth_the_wait!!__just_be_patient!:jl	I, like many many others, ordered the 4811 and 4911 when I read the article.  I ordered directly through herroom.com on 6/24.  I knew it was going to be a long wait, and they also sent me 3 e-mails during the summer to let me know that they hadn't forgotten my order, but the delays were significant due to the heavy demand.  They always gave me the option of cancelling my order, since they don't charge my card until they ship out the order.  I almost did, but my order finally came 9/10, and I must say that they really are the most comfortable thongs I've ever worn.  I've already placed another large order, as Christmas gifts for my friends!	1

436124	"Rip It Off" is not an easy film to watch. In short, it is dull and meanders from plot line to plot line, leaving only the most attentive viewer (read: myself) to guess at what was going to happen next. But not in a good way. Judging from its drab look and unimaginatively shot scenes, not to mention a script whose dialogue borders on the absurd, it never ceases to amaze me how it managed to attract such well-known and talented personalities as Alyson Hannigan and Jennifer Esposito. It begs the question: WHY DID YOU DO THIS FILM? Or, on a personal note, why did I BUY this film, especially at $22 and change? Frankly, I bought it because of Alyson Hannigan: she's gorgeous, obviously intelligent, and the girl can act. Individually speaking, she does not disappoint here. It's obvious that she really didn't want to sleep walk through her role as Lexi, and she gives the other actors a lot of material to work with. Although the silly musical leitmotifs seem deliberately crafted to undermine her scenes, she is a singularly interesting actor to watch, and her performance simply wants me to see her do more, preferably a more mature and fully fleshed out character in a serious film (see Jennifer Aniston in her brave performance in "The Good Girl.")But enough gushing: if Ms. Hannigan had not been as engaged, I would have trashed her soundly. Most everyone else in "Rip It Off" (with the possible exception of the fellow who plays Sergei with operatic relish) is more or less "phoning it in" when they do their scenes. This made me lack any kind of sympathy for them in addition to making me sleepy. Also, films of such low production value should come with a printed warning of some sort: BEWARE! DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN; THE APPEARANCE OF THE FILM IS INHERENTLY BAD. "Rip It Off" and films of its ilk give independent filmmaking a black eye. I've seen black and white student films with greater intrigue and atmosphere than this turkey. And, contrary to the technical description of the DVD, IT IS PRESENTED IN THE HORROR THAT IS FULL SCREEN, AND NOT WIDESCREEN. Can you believe people invest money in these films? (Ahem.	0
B000095SCM:counter_top_trash_can_looks_great_:c._sullivan	I got this trash can to put on the counter next to my coffee maker for discarded Sweet & Low packages. I love how it fits in with my black and stainless appliances. The item itself works pretty good for the most part. The only issue I have found with it is the lid fits loosely on the base and slides off when putting something in it. to remedy the issue, I am planning to drill a tiny hole in the sides and out a tiny hand screw on each side of the lid to hold it firmly in place.	1

0792160932:return_of_great_science_fiction:adam_paul_bailey	Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get "absorbed".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming	1
B0002803KC:great_unit:shioda	I bought this fireplace a few months ago and have enjoyed many a nice night drinking a martini and watching the fire.  This fireplace got me motivated to cut down the tree that died in my yard last year.  Half way through burning it!  Now for the unit.  It arrived nicely packed with all parts.  Installation was a snap, about 15 minutes.  There were dents in the screen, which is obviously part of the packing process. They are so small, though, that they cannot be seen unless someone is specifically looking for them.  The removable screens on the side are nice for adding more wood while the fire is still going.  Be sure to use mitts or tongs, however, or you will get burned.	1

88787	My nephew really needed a new controller.  So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday.  The game was received fine, but he never received the controller.  I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later.  Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon.  The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon.	0

B00004SU1Z:bad_design:	When my Krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service, I decided to order the Capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted &quot;cool grind.&quot;  I wish I had ordered the  Krups instead.  The Capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee, and the  design ensures that no matter how careful you are, you will spill ground  coffee all over your counter.  In the time since I bought it another  reviewer has reported that his or her Capresso broke within six months.  Do  not buy this model	0

587773	Practical, sage advice from Stanley. Not as good as his follow up, "The Millionaire Mind" this book is somewhat pedantic. It also suffers from the fact it's extremely dry. The author's writing is much more engaging in his followup, and that's a much faster read.	1
B00009K3V9:too_much_trouble:parkers_back	Looks great in my kitchen but I, too, only use it for shakes & smoothies.  It DOES smell like burning rubber nearly every time.

0790734893:not_that_great:christopher_helms	A number of people had told me that this was a very good war movie and one that should be viewed as soon as possible.  Honestly, I was not impressed.  The plot is disjointed and confusing; jumping from the North African Theatre to the European Theatre almost seamlessly, leaving the viewer thoroughly confused.  The character development is also very poor.  No one character stands out due to the fact that Samuel Fuller never allows them to grow or mature by switches between multiple characters too frequently or by not allowing any lengthy dialogue.  Historically speaking this film is a joke.  During the action scenes when the Germans have tanks they are in fact American tanks with the German symbol painted on.  Also, uniforms are sometimes inaccurate.  However, the most annoying aspect is the fact that Samuel Fuller makes it appear as though this squad of men is the ONLY squad fighting the entire war.  Only once or twice do you see any other American troops.  This feeling of isolation detracts from the overall sense of a full scale war, of which these men are supposed to be a part of.  Finally, to make matters worse, the film's action sequences are sometimes imaginative but are often impractical, sloppy, awkwardly placed, and consist of ridiculous situations.	0
B0006Q5UQ2:1_year_and_still_happy:tom_schwab	After reading these other reviews, I decided to wait a while to post a review.  I bought two of these chairs summer 04 and they are doing great.

My wife would make me get rid of these if there was any issue or problem with them at all.  I hope she doesn't read this	1
B000BYPLMM:luxury_bath/spa_booster_seat_cushion:helmhog	This booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa.  It is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits.  You need to put in in the spa while it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on.  It is a good product.	1
146565	Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.	0

571737	Esquire has gone through a lot of changes over the years. It went from a old style GQ clone to a magazine that has broadened its writing, reach, and content. Esquire now occupies a unique nitch in the world of men's magazines. It offers intelligent, thoughtful commentary on life, music, movies and celebrity, occasionally good fiction, good advice columns, a special but brief look at an extraordinary woman in each issue, and heartfelt stories on real issues that affect men, like an author detailing his battle with cancer. Another big bonus, Esquire is not oversaturated with advertisements when compared to GQ and other similar magazines. By comparison to some, Esquire is about 1/3 the size for the same content.	1

You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging	0

However, it didn't work in our bed (queen size) because it was big and bulky. If you plan on using it in your bed buy "inclined to sleep" with positioners. Babies'R'Us sells it now. It's easier to move the sleeping baby from and to your bed when in inclined to sleep.	1
297982	This film is among the worst, most pointless, and most inane garbage that I've ever had the misfortune to view. Contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was CREEPY! The little boy was extremely annoying, and his relationship with the alien made me ill! Actually it made me more than ill, it was down right disturbing! His bond with the alien was one of the most freeky thing I have ever had to witness, and the kids family was just obnoixious. By the time the alien go home no one really cares anymore. You are just relieved that the film is finally over. Watch it only to say that you've seen this.	0

351977	Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.	0
B000CSEE3O:great_for_the_car!:rachel_l.	We love this seat.  It is great for keeping in the car for those times when you find yourself in a packed restaurant that is out of high chairs.  Or at mother inlaws without a highchair.  Or a family holiday dinner where there is no highchair.  When traveling with a little one or even just at the park or a sporting event.  There are so many uses for this great little seat.  It is extremely light weight and compact, and comes with a carrying bag	1
B000E617U2:big_comfort_by_the_pool_or_patio:ellie_"eilean_siar"	This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every penny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it	1
297053	This was a good game that keeps you thinking. The story line is that something terrible has happened and you end up being able to go back in time to change events and therefore change the outcome. You get to go back to different era's such as the horse and buggy era and back to modern day. There are several endings as well depending on what you've done. You end up playing it through several times to experience the different endings. The plot of the story is good and the game has a good pace because time is an issue. So you feel like you got to stay on your toes	1
B00007FCQ1:blue_lizard_suncream:e._moulton	Excellent product.  Really protects you.  My dermatologist recommended this product and although it's more expensive - it's worth the protection for your skin.  I'm glad my children are using it	1
B000GANONY:good_camera,_worth_the_money.:adam	This camera does everything it says; yes, it's waterproof and I was very uneasy taking a digital camera into the water for the first time!!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars:  it is as slow as every other digital camera I've owned as far as focusing, multiple flashes, and then actually shooting.  You get your subject's attention and they smile, frozen, as you hold down the shutter release for a good 3 seconds until the shot is taken (in low light.) I was especially intrigued by its "Bright Capture" technology, but it honestly doesn't seem any different in low light than my old Sony U20 2MP tiny little snapshot camera.  Still that same flash-in-the-dark look.  There is a fill-flash low light program mode (among many many others), but the shutter speed sets itself so slow the background becomes a messy worthless blob, even if you hold your breath and try to remain still.  My ideal snapshot camera is portable, durable, quick, easy, and produces excellent results without having to think about your exposure modes.  This camera has 3.5 out of those 5.  It is way portable, very durable, easy, produces OK results but you have to mess with settings if you're not in daylight, and it's not very quick.	1
B00005KAPW:p.o.s.:not_so	Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed.

I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness	0
B000EYPNCW:salt:rpg_lover	I can hardly eat this for all of the salt, it leaves you thirsty it's so bad. The ingredients list reads, literally, "100% organic sweet corn, sea salt, and nothing else".

B000HYX3WG:bad:p._van_ness-gloeckner_"p_gloeckner"	I ordered this guitar for my grandson for Christmas.  There is no way to keep the strings tight even though you turn the screws to tighten.  When you do tighten, the strings are brittle (as if really old) and break.  To get a refund on this item you have to obtain an RMA, pay for return shipping (which will probably be almost as much as the guitar) and they will issue a refund after they receive the guitar back. So I will probably be out about $10.00!	0

55554	As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.

B00080VMHC:don't_waste_your_money:l._lozier_"unhappy_mom"	It only runs for about 15 minutes with a child who weighs 50 lbs.  Doesn't run well over pine needles or leaves.  (Make sure to rake the yard before riding!) The acceleration in slow, the child pushes on the pedal and nothing happens.  I spent most of the 15 minutes run time push starting the thing.  It stops when the child tries to make a tight turn.  All of this was on the grass-it was advertised as being rugged off-road capable, when in fact it only works on the paved driveway.

B0009R31TG:well_above_5_stars.__the_best_interactive_toy_available.___10_stars:adobe_princess_"laura"	My pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind.  He jumps to pull the beas out of the hive.  He squeaks the beas.  Perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head.  He went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it.  It is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads.  He likes the wing detail for chewing on.  This toy gives exercise.  I am so glad I tried it.  He plays with the hegehog on his own.  Those are the 2 best toys.  The squirels from the hide a squirel are fun, but the game holder is not something he was really excited about.  These interactive toys are great.  I have never seen such excitement and tail wagging.  He hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise.  This one is the best.  It is well worth $10 for a dog who loves to play.  I get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys	1

As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommende	1
B000001DYZ:realistically_tff's_best:john_a._reid	Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears.	1
B0001XGNRK:best_blades,_best_price:j._madden_"horselady"	This is the second time I have ordered these blades for my husband.

My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.	0
245798	My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1 & 2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!	0
527996	I wanted a non-iPod digital music player, and found this to be a terrific option.  It plays a number of different formats, and includes a lanyard, which is nice when commuting on the train, or for plane travel.  I have only used alkaline batteries so far, and have had excellent battery life.  The menu takes an hour or 2 of playing with to learn, but once you get familiar with the buttons and menu, it's pretty easy.  I have also enjoyed the built in FM tuner, and have not any trouble with reception, even on a moving commuter train.  The sound quality is very good.  I've been using 128 bitrate MP3 songs so far.  The software for transferring music is pretty easy to use, although I did have a little trouble getting the player to be recognized as connected, which seemed to be some kind of order of connections issue.  The included earbuds aren't the most comfortable, especially since I already lost the foam padding, but I will probably get a better pair anyway.  They do sound good though.  Also, the included cases are pretty cheesy and I didn't even bother with them.	1

B00014PLAY:does_not_fit_crib_-_no_returns_allowed:p._cox	The crib tent did not fit our crib.  It's not deep enough or long enough. I called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned. I am very disatisfied with this company and the product.	0
B00069IQG0:not_great:kumoito	I have two of these head sets.  One never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time I bought it.  The other seems to charge alright.  the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.	0
B000ITVRQY:great_battery!:naota_"grey_fox"	I've had the battery for about a week now. Simply love it. I'm a heavy user of GPS Applications and Power Vision for web-surfing on the go. I used to charge the phone twice a day, now I charge it once a day and sometimes I even forget to plug it in at night and I still have 2 bars of battery left half way through the day. Even when i forget to charge it hasn't died on me.	1
B0009X7TPM:so_fresh_n_so_clean:beth.	Inis has a very fresh/crisp/clean scent that I love.  It's kind of a subtle scent and not overpowering, which is what I like about it.  It's also very androgynous so a man or woman could wear it.  Whenever I wear it people always sniff and make comments like "what are you wearing?" and "mmm! you smell so good.	1
417835	I've been a 24 fan ever since I saw the very first episode. It delivered drama, action, and shocks and twists. After the end of Season 2 and the beginning of season 3, I was left with questions: How did David Palmer recover?, and how did Jack Bauer and Chase Edmunds first started working together? Then I heard that 24 The Game was coming out and that it would answer those question, plus more, because it takes place between Seasons 2 and 3. In this game, you get to play Jack Bauer(yes!!!), Tony Almeida, and Chase Edmunds.	1

250104	I use the IR interface with the Polar s625x running computer, and I have never encountered a single problem. I usually use the interface in to different computers, a notebook at home (with XP), and a desktop at work (2000), and in both computers it works nicely.	1
B000063085:pricey_for_what_you_get,_if_you_get_it_at_all.:ty_j._rost_"tjr127"	I was more or less forced to buy this product because I had very precise size requirements and this product fitted them.  I was very disappointed by the quality of the product for the cost.  It comes in about 19 different pieces, all of which are a hollow plastic polymer.  It is fairly lightweight, which could be good or bad depending on what you plan to do with it.  At the $200+ price, you'd think they would include a shelf, but they only give you a stencil to make it yourself out of 'shelving material'.	0
320062	I bought this game for my new family for Christmas.  This is not at all the Game of Life that I remember playing for countless hours as a child.  First of all, my old game had all of the mountains, houses, and spinner permenantly attached to the game board.  With the new version, all of these things have to be attached with each setup, which takes about 10-15 minutes and they are easily knocked off the board.  Also, the spinner is hard to spin and frequently comes off of its pivot.  The cars are less sturdy and the people pegs do not stay in the car so you are constantly having to put the people back in the car.  Finally, the rules of the game have gotten more complicated and yet the meaning of the game has become more trivial.  I think I will put this in the top of a closet or in a yard sale and go find my old version of the game to play in the future	0
103272	Beginning with the introduction, I was taken on a fabulous journey. These gifted authors write a wonderful narrative.  Lande's Snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion. They are as engaging as any short story in the New Yorker!	1
B000MWG8KC:great_quality:c._williams	There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.	1
B00030NOEQ:i_love_bowling!:j._kidd_"a_fan_of_many_things"	I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	1
88702	This was my very first book for Nora Roberts, and so far it's the best book EVER.  It is THE PERFECT book.  Brianna is a wonderful, smart inn keeper with many talents and a rare kind of maturity.  I would love to be like her!  And Gray is a successful, sweet, caring, witty author that comes to her inn in Ireland to relax and start a new book.  This is no ordinary romance.  I love that it goes deep, not only into the main characters' personalities, but there is also Brianna's sister and brother-in-law, her mother, her friend, and Gray's agent.  Not to mention the wonderful scenary of Ireland described throughout the book.  The conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying, leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time!  Other books by Nora Roberts are good, but this one takes the prize.  Of the Born trilogy this one is the best and it should NOT be missed	1
B000AMMN9O:blitz_rhino_ramps:g._c._st_pierre	Great product-light weight stores easily doesn't need much room- will fit under low stance vehicles used mine under my subaru and didn't scrape the bottom of my car. Highly recommended product	1
B0000B35GE:post_too_big..ouch:nicola_a._dixon_"nicole"	These earrings are very pretty, but the post is WAY TOO THICK.  They killed my ears and I had to return them.  I would guess the post is at least 2.5 times as thick as a normal post, and my ears did not like it!!!	0
B000JJRIPC:not_up_to_par:c._broughton	I'm a big fan of Great Big Sea and I purchase everything they release. Apparently they were trying to give this CD the "feel" of a live, medium-size venue performance. Unlike their other live DC offerings, this one sounds like it was recorded with a micro-cassette tape in some fan's front pocket. It doesn't give justice to their usual great vocals and unique sound. Overall, I was pretty disappointed and I'd recommend their earlier offerings over this one.	0

B0000667EE:two_came_and_went:	We ordered this for a spare fridge and it would be a great size, but the first on came and it was damaged. It looked like it had been dropped. Then I called Target. They did great taking care of getting us another on. Only the second came today and it was also dropped from a truck. The back was dented and it was already rusting. so I think we will try some where else for this item.	0
B000139H7I:perfect_honing_steel,_great_length_and_weight:willy_loman	Great honing steel that is a bit longer than others I looked at (seems to help a bit for the bigger knives) and an attractive taper (not sure that matters, but it looks nice).  I've only had it a brief time, though I've used it frequently.  Despite an occasional clumsy collision, this steel slides smoothly and shows no nicks.  It straightens the edge on my (mostly) mid-grade knives with ease.	1
B00005OL46:a_great_knife_-_but_invest_in_the_right_sharpening_tools:eliot_axelrod_"red_letter"	This is one of my most used knives in the kitchen. It's the best from cutting garlic to slicing up melons. You'll find that the deep blade is a real joy to control, and that you can make short work of major chopping and slicing jobs easily.	1
312795	This works great for charging both my DS Lite and classic DS from USB. I also like the included keychain flashlight- it's kind of random thing to include that is in no way related to the charger, but it's quite bright and handy to have anyways.	1
B000BH4GUC:hate_this_coffeemaker:sandra_j._horton	I've had this coffeemaker for two weeks. I bought it because I had an old Mr. Coffee that worked fine, but was white and stained.  I liked that this was black and looked sleek.  The very second time I used it, the off button stuck, so you can no longer turn off the machine, but have to wait for it to turn itself off.  Also, EVERY pot has grounds in it.  I'm using the filters that came with it, and have never even filled it to capacity, and I can't figure out why there are ALWAYS grounds in my coffee.  Piece of junk.  Don't buy it	0

B000096M5Y:the_best_choice_for_the_task...:cheraerae_"leplum"	These are the best pads for the task...the ultra thin pads are great for during the day...they dont leak and are very breathable...the heavier flow pads are great for overnight protection depending on the amount of liquid that you are leaking.  i am now nursing my 2nd daughter and i will forever use these pads.  the variety pack also offers the best value for your dollar.  try every kind you get...samples are free so use them but when you have to buy these are the most natural and positivly the best.	1
B000FF8QXI:good,_but_thick,_watch:randomlygenerated	As other people have pointed out, this is a very solid watch. I really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls, or anything like that. However, this is partly due to its enormous thickness. It's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large - it's how thick it is. If you have a small wrist, this watch is probably not for you, as it will be very noticeable. It's also not especially light, obviously, but it feels comfortable enough.	1
410830	Okay, first of all, this game is a VERY violent game, and i would NOT recommend parents to buy it for children under 13. You must also make sure that they know the violence and crime is FAKE. There will be serious consequences for doing these things in real life, and they know not to do what they do in this game. Back to the game, this is simply, hands down, the best game ever created. It is an innovation within an innovaton. The storyline is excellent, as you get betrayed and shot by your friend during a bank robbery. Later, you must work your way through the dark streets of Liberty City, working your way toward the ones who betrayed you. The missions never repeat themselves, and they are always fun and challenging. BUT, you WILL NOT be able to beat this game without codes, and i do not know anyone who did. So i strongly advise you get the codes before playing. Other than that, the sense of freedom this game gives you in between and after all of the missions is astounding. You can go almost anywhere, and do almost anything, something never before acheived in a video game.	1
B000G3E22I:airpsplat's_service_stinks--avoid_them:james_c._laughrey_"jlaughry"	I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift.

Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.	0
B000KPY83K:wow_i_didnt_know_a_phone_could_do_this:jacob_hartburg_"jh"	I just go the phone about 3 days ago and i love it.  It is my favorite phone i have had to date.  Some people ask me "What can that thing do"? and i respond to that what cant it do.  This phone can do anything you really want.  The features are nicely made to be used.  Especially since it has a beautiful 2.2 in touchscreen.  The display is incredible.  I can go on microsoft word and do what i need to do.  The last thing is that the price for everything it does is outstanding you should get it when it is cheap if you have the chance	1

B0000ET7MS:good,_soft_protection_for_your_camera:conrayber_"conrayber"	What I love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. It fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it. (I have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras). This one seems to be an improved model.	1
B00012BSOY:only_good_for_older_kids:a._black	This stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers.

You cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens. You look and look, searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow, but no. No Memorabilia Card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles. Of course, the Topps Company doesn't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby!  Thanks.	0
137697	I must say.  I am a owner of a xbox and xbox 360.  I will never, and I repeat never, buy another system.  The xbox360 clearly blows all the competition away.  Sony fans do not stand a chance.  With the best graphics and gameplay on the planet.  Microsoft is clearly #1.  I have a first generation xbox 360 and have never had a problem to this day. If you want a awesome system, that works with your Media Center, plays music, cds, display's pictures, great gameplay both offline and online, free demos, maps, characters, and movies via the awesome xbox live, then my friend, this system is definately for you.  Thanks Bill Gates. Now, go make a hand held one.. :-))))))	1

56164	Nick Xu, if you can't figure out the difference between this lens, and the cheaper consumer grade lenses, by all means, stay with the cheaper consumer grade lenses. After all, "Mr Magoo" of cartoon fame couldn't tell a Chevy from a Rolls Royce. All kidding aside, this lens is simply awesome in use. Having one of these lenses in a camera bag is very close in practice to owning three or four high end prime lenses. Yes, it's that good.	1
B0006TT0E2:long_lasting,_great_shape_and_support:bon	I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet	1

217776	Is the main goal of EVERY male evo-psy writer to attack feminism?

It's f&#%ing comical. But guess what? The females' books are way better thought out and accurate while the males' are a lot of wishful thinking. Hmmm....aging, successful man writes that lovely young lasses and aging, successful males are made for each other.

B0009VEOFW:works_for_me!:j._finkel_"jack_of_trades"	These cups are high quality stainless steel.  Don't worry about putting thorugh the dishwasher or leaving in a sink.  I was surprised by their weight and long handles.  My old measuring cups were of much thinner steel and over time this lead to dents and deformation of the cups.  These MIU cups are extremely sturdy.  The handles on my old cups were more typical too, while these MIU cups all have very long handles(~4.5").  At first I didn't like the asthestics of the handles, nor the fact that the smaller ones don't stand up on their own due to the imbalance this creates.  However, when I needed to scoop something out of a small-mouthed container, I quickly reversed my opinion of these handles.	1

B000IOQ0MU:excellent_product_for_the_money:t._johnson	I live in san francisco and we bike everywhere so I'd been trying to find a new bike trailer for my 2.5 yo daughter who outgrew her front mounted baby seat.  Everywhere I went the trailers were priced at $250 plus.  I was a bit skeptical about buying this Instep because it was a "no name" brand (wrong - it turns out that its made by Schwinn) although it was priced at about half the price on others.  When I research the product I found it to be lighter than the pricier brands.  It runs smooth, easy to attach/detach.  I keep the stroller front wheels always mounted so that I my daughter falls asleep and i wnt to walk around she's can continue sleeping.  I recently did grocery shopping with the trailer and my daughter.  It has a rear compartment that fit 3 traderjoes paper shopping bags, an additional bag in the front with my daughter, and one more on the rear basket that is mounted on my bike.  I've also taken my daughter an another of her friends (it sits two kids) and they loved it.  Overall, a very good product - although not a sleek and cute as others like the burley - but its lighter, and priced much below comparable products	1

B00003CWU8:i_know_fred_twoo:mensadude_"bob"	The personality of a Nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance.

Brownshirts insult, assault, rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas.	0
B00009KF1J:product_changed-used_to_be_much_better.:amazon_customer	We have been buying the Melita Buzzworthy Dark Roast pods for over two years and were quite satisfied.  Recently, they increased the diameter of the pods to enable them to fit other machines.  I also understand thet they have increased the diameter of the pod holder in the new machines they are selling.  At the time Melita made these changes, I believe they also reduced the quality of the coffee in their new pods because it just does not taste nearly as good.  Accordingly, I rated the old pods with 4 stars but the new pods deserve only 2 stars.  We are now sampling pods from other companies to find a good dark roast coffee	0

B000BXKTMA:perfect!:scientific_mom	I ordered this potty chair after seeing the others all had some negative aspects.  This seat is perfect!  My almost 2.5 year old daughter took to it immediately.  It's not too small (she's very tall) but not too big (she has a petite bottom).  It cleans up easily, and is not so lightweight or small that it becomes a toy for her.  The seat part itself comes off to use on a regular toilet, and has handles for the child to steady him/herself.  The bowl insert is large and removes easily for cleaning.  There are also handles on the base that overlap with the handles on the seat so you can easily pick it up and move it.  The lid closes "just like mommy's potty" and becomes a wide flat step stool.  Perfect product	1
B00004RW5D:one_beautifully_filmed_butchered_mess_of_a_movie!!!!!!!!:brian_kerr_"brian_kerr"	If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure.This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through.Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out "something" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,"WHAT???!!!" This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda.Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events.There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands.It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes!Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the noferious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed "butchered" mess of a movie.2*'s because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so lovely,but nay a farthing more!!	0

413607	If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately	0

B00009YQX2:need_be_contortionist_to_wear:j._kern_"josie's_mama"	I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend "Jogbra" or "Chamion" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted.	0
B000056HKJ:better_than_a_traditional_highchair!:salty_mamma	We have a very small kitchen so I knew I could never have a large highchair. I registered for the Healthy Chair by Fisher Price but after putting my son in it once to try it out I returned it for this one and never regretted it. This one has a higher back, reclines and has a comfortable cushion that is removable and washable (the one I have is better than the one shown. I bought it at babiesrus). It actually comes with 2 cushions and 2 abc/123 plastic mats that go on the tray. My son is very comfortable in it and I love that we can take it anywhere.	1
B00005A3L2:best_metal_detector_for_the_money_anywhere!:	I did a lot of searching and review reading on the internet before finally deciding what to buy. I am convinced Quick Draw II is THE best value available of any make by any conpany. The features on the QDII are generally found only on much higher priced detectors. This thing really works as advertised. I have already found several coins and other things right in my own yard. It will reliably indicate what coin is being detected although it many times confuses dimes and pennies on the LCD readout. It is very sensitive and detects most coin size items very reliably to about 6 or 8 inches. The auto notch discrimination works well and filters out most trash items. I have used metal detectors that ended up being aggravating and frustrating. This one is a pleasure to use and is quickly becoming a relaxing and profitable pastime for me. If you want a serious metal detector without spending a whole lot of money give it a try... you won't be disappointed..	1

317058	This film having been produced in 1957, was seen by me in 1958 while serving as a D.I. AT P.I. It showed for two consecutive nights and I think every D.I. on P.I. somehow arranged to see it. We wanted to see if they got it right I guess. I viewed it again recently and it was most nostalgic. A most memorable time and the film was reasonably accurate for the times. I highly recommend it	1

B000FEPA2O:worse_than_shaving:lizziefar	I bought this product based on the great reviews on amazon.  I had one of the original epiladies from the eighties, and was expecting some kind of miraculous new design that would be pain-free and effective.  Well, I guess you can't have both.  It's very comfortable to use but completely ineffective.  It takes forever to clear each section of hair, and the hair that is taken off breaks off just above the surface.  So the result is skin as stubbly as a three day old shaving job.  I guess it's back to the good old razor for me	0
B000056J1X:manufacturer_defect:shadowlyllie	I have to say that I just 20 min ago recieved this cover in the mail, (I ordered online because I'm so far from a Babies R Us location) and I was excited at first. The color is great, and the cover fit perfectly, but I haven't washed it yet. Actually I have to return mine already because a manufacturer defect in the fabric.

I plan to exchange this cover for another of the same, I hope for better luck with the next one, but man, the hassle of having to mail this back and sit and wait is just frustrating	0

It goes great over other lip gloss/lipstick or alone.  All of the colors are great, but I'd start our with pink first.  My personal favorite is "Spring Fling" because it's not so bright, but it's still juicy.  You will deffinetly not regret buying one of these.  It's worth every penny	1

It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text.

B00009KFCU:homedics_pa-400h_therapist_select_percussion_massager_with_heat:tm	The best price around for this type massager.  Price was my main reason for the purchase.

I would highly recommend it.	1
B00001W0DT:does_this_work_with_desktop_pcs?:seshadri_g	I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :&lt;..	0
B00006JHR7:this_brush_is_amazing:holly_a._young	When I pick up the brush both my dogs fight to be first.  My Chow has long hair that is always in knots on her backside.  This brush just plowed right through them and she never even seem to notice.  My Malamute thinks I have nothing better to do than use it on her.  It completely got rid of the odors.  My dogs rate it their second favorite thing in the house just under their food.  The most amazing thing was I had to buy a second brush as I found by accident that it works for me too.  I have very long hair that gets knotted very easy.  In a hurry one day I picked up their brush and in seconds the knot was gone.  No pulling no ripping of hair.  If you have the same trouble I suggest you give it a try.  Would be Super for kids	1

I even loved Nebraska, so don't tell me it's an E-Street band thing or a rock versus folk thing, but this album is unlistenable.	0

The first time it was used was also the last time it was used because it was left on top of the oven while I baked a batch of cookies.  The heat from the oven melted the back of the timer.  Good thing I also used the timer on the oven clock as a back up or I may have had to pitch the timer AND the cookies.  Even if this product were free, I would not use one	0

The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.	1
372098	Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart	0
B0009ET3SC:great_for_the_weak_or_elderly_(and_strong_and_hearty):colonel_jenna	I bought this for my aged Mom after she confessed that the big plush expensive terry towel I'd bought her was just too heavy for her to handle.  She *adores* the microfiber towels I got her!  They are light for her weak arms, they are so very absorbent that one or two passes gets her dry and that's particularly important with the delicate skin of the elderly.  Not to mention that I, a hearty creature in my prime, love these towels too! I shall be buying more of various styles and colors	1
373101	This game has been out for a while. And I have been playing it for a long time now. Have I ever had a boring moment while playing GTA: SA? No...

People giving GTA: SA low ratings must be joking.	1
B000M23P3U:not_what_i_expected...:t._falk_"newmotouser"	After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing	0

B00005QJIP:unforgiving_in_every_respect:indyrod	First of all, let me tell you, this is NOT a date movie.  This is the most brutal graphic rape movie I have ever seen, and also one that lingers in your mind long after it is over.  For me, that's exactly what I want when I see a movie, one that leaves a lasting impression no matter how difficult the impression might be.  I loved this movie, because it is very very well made, and the acting performances are incredible.  Yes, the rapes are unforgiving in every respect, and the misery throughout the film is almost difficult to watch at times.  This is not a gory movie, except for the last ten minutes, it is a very disturbing movie and it does have a fair amount of nudity, however it really needs to.  "The Untold Story" and "Ebola Syndrome" offset much of the carnage with humor, but "Red to Kill" has absolutely NOTHING to smile about.  It is totally and brutally serious from the first frame to the extremely nasty ending.  The story is pretty simple, a psycho-rapist is on the loose and he's going after a mentally retarded young dancer.  In the second graphic rape of the movie he does the deed to the young lady.  Enter a female social worker who tries to help the victim, and dreams up a plan to get even with the rapist after he gets off in court because of a stupid technicality.  Her plan succeeds to a certain extent, but not like she planned it, and the rapist comes after her full force.  The actor who plays the rapist is absolutely sensational, and I might add, the musical score is perfect.  The music adds so much to the all ready existing tension from all the horrific acts.  The actress who plays the retarded girl is also amazing, one of the best performances on film you will ever see.  To end this, this is a must-see movie for fans of this genre, and I'm just getting started myself.  Not the gore associated with the two previous Cat III movies I watched, but something even more terrible and unrelenting, and an uneasy feeling that will not leave you anytime soon after you see it.  "Red to Kill" is flatout a good movie, even considering the subject matter.  I highly recommend it	1

B0001LVX2C:great_mascara!:h._v._schultz	This mascara is great, it's easy to remove with a little warm water, but the best thing about it is that it won't give you 'racoon eyes'.

83141	This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	1

B00009KWZD:not_durable:andrew_to_"amto"	My 3 year old daughter and I have no problem making good size bubbles with this wand.  The design is nice, it snap back easily for storage and the color is nice.  However, after using it twice, the plastic hoop at the snapping piece and the stick is twisted.  This makes the hoop to be wailing back and forth even though it was snap in place.  It makes the wand impossible to make bubble by waving.  My daughter was frustrated.  I eventually went with some cheap plactic wands that do not have the fancy mechanism and they are extremely durable with many abusive use from a little child.  I don't recommend this wand	0
B0006GWUT2:this_body_glove_can_easily_cause_loss_of_your_$$_phone.:lawrence_a_team_"a_team_member"	Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril	0
B0009RTOQK:strong_scent:image_capture	I ordered the gift set and it came as advertised. Very cute package. Unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast (that I could find) so I could not test it. It is far too strong a scent, even the lotion. The candle filled the house with the scent in 10 minutes. My advice, find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing	0
B0000B3E8U:great_stereo_component:fred_felts_"eightharrow47"	This is actually the second RCDW500C I have purchased.  The first is still working, but it has so many miles on it that I wanted to have a back-up ready when it is time to be replaced.  Sony electronics, in my experience, are some of the toughest in the business.  The old unit may last a lot longer.  I am on my third Sony TV in the last thirty five years; the second is still working for the person I finally gave it to.	1

B000G62LEG:does_not_come_with_a_slipcover,_despite_description:guacgirl	The description says "slipcover zips off for easy cleaning", but the product did not come with a slipcover.

208279	My dad got this for me to supplement a Latin textbook I have been studying for my high school language course. It is quick and easily understandable. You get plenty of words and phrases, which is perfect for a traveler. If you want to learn the language for the sake of knowing it, not travel, however, you'd better get a book to supplement this. It doesn't teach about pluralization, verb conjugation, or other oddities that the language holds, such as, in Latin, the ending -m which implies a direct object. The Latin CD also does not use the dashes over the vowels, which may or may not be necessary, I don't know. Overall, I am very happy with the product and with the price of $39.99 (USD), but I am also quite glad I have my textbook (ECCE ROMANI) to go with it	1
B0002OHOQC:a_superb_camera_for_its_worth:nightmare009_"vinayak"	This camera is an exelent camara. It has plenty of effects, plenty of modes, plenty of scenery options. The image quality is 3.2 megapixel, but its quite good. The pictures you take without the flash do end up getting a bit blury, where as if you take it with the flash, it comes out exelent. And sometimes it takes a long time for the picture to get taken with out the flash, and sometimes it happens imediatly. But all these flaws are only with my version.	1
B00013RC4S:just_when_you_think_dolph_can't_get_sink_any_lower..........:ryan_kareem	I will be honest I like Dolph Lundgren.........a look at his filmography you see B.movie classics such as "The Punisher",Universal Soldier" and "Blackjack" Dolph has been going trough a slump.........Storm Catcher and the startlingly routine Jill The Ripper and the awful Minion(AKA Fallen Knight) but with Agent Red Dolph Lundgren hits rock bottom. Agent Red first of all steals it's music from Predator 2......and it's plot from Counter Measures,Oh I'm not finished yet. It steals footage from Storm Catcher!!!!!!!!! The scene where Jon Penner steals the  air craft while posing as Dolph Lundgren..........Now Penner is 5'11 Dolph Lundgren is 6'5 for goodness sake! yet they try to pass it off as Dolph Lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission.....This scene made me wanna throw up but I hung in there.....It turns out more footage is stolen.......I swear I saw footage from Iron Eagle  and Iron Eagle II.......I saw footage from Crimson Tide and I saw footage from Counter Measures........What the heck was Dolph thinking when he signed for this junk? I have no idea. When I was a teen (When Showdown In Little Tokyo came out) I thought Dolph Lundgren couldn't sink lower then Showdown In Little Tokyo,Then when I saw The Minion I was almost sure Dolph couldn't do worse........Well I pray he can't do any worse because Agent Red is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life..........This is coming from a guy who likes Don The Dragon Wilson. Bottomline:On Agent Red's cover it says "Once exposed you cannot survive"  Take this as a warning	0
B000EMK3V0:my_family_loves_these_as_a_side_dish:sandra_trolinger_"trolsgirl"	When I am short of time and want a fast side dish I make these and my family loves them.  When I don't have time to peel, dice & boil potatoes these save the day.  Teens can prepare them with ease too.	1
B00004THDE:hi-tech_solution_for_the_gitters:bama_swampfox	This is only the second pair of binoculars I've owned but I've used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like Nikons and Leicas.  I can say without hesitation that the Canon 18X50s have met all my expectations for clarity, build quality, and ease of use. They are still quite heavy so, you won't be holding them too long in one position but, the stabilization feature provides a stable, gitter free image. In my opinion, this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff: the Canon 18X50s have more usable magnification for the money for non-tripod, hand held applications.	1
52466	Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced	0
300488	This is an amazing, beautiful album.  Probably a little more difficult to get into than Streethawk, but after about the 4th or 5th listen, I found it more rewarding.  The music is very dense, and the lyrics are beautifully poetic (it helps that Dan Bejar has chosen to include a lyric sheet in the cover this time).  A great album for any fan of intelligent independent music	1

B000BPQPXK:cheap,_does_not_do_what_it_promises:m._cohrs	The unit is supposed to have a projection LED. The manual states that "When the unit is plugged into AC outlet, the projection alarm will continuously project the time."  This does not happen. What good is the projection when in the middle of the night you have to find the clock, find the right button and read the time befor the light goes out?  How do you trust a company like this	0

100002	I subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in PDF form. I was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. Frankly I was disappointed. The reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis, (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). Reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... Please. They are also fairly out of date. Most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. Some titles aren't available anywhere that I can figure. Whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find?	0

391689	I really enjoyed this game.  Yes, it is not perfect, but it is definitely worth the price of the game.  If you're looking for escape back to the old West, then this is your game.  As many of the reviewers have mentioned, there are some flaws in the game - if you can get past them, then I am positive you will enjoy the game.	1
B000GZYJL0:would_you_like_to_know_what_it_feels_like_to_have_your_feet_in_a_vise?:darel_l._dillingham_"dd53"	These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable.	0
B000001DT7:nice_voice,_poor_arrangements:enric_vidal_rod	Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are  unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra.  Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with  candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and  again	0
B00006K39C:rip_off:katherine_garrett	While the magazine itself is a great magazine (very informative)you can buy it through the cards that come in the magazine for far less money. Don't get ripped off. Buy it through the magazine	0
0306807831:unconvinced:	I must agree with some other reviewers of this book, and say that it is a very dry list of factual data, interspersed with Bill Wyman's moans and boasts. His gripe with Allan Klein about money seems to be quite valid, but he mentions it about a thousand times. Mick and Keith get quite a pasting- again it seems quite valid, but do we need to hear it so many times?    Bill opines that Keith Richard's voice is weak and that his own songs were ignored by the band. Listen to his only self-penned Stones track of the 60s, on &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot;, and you will conclude that this is quite a self delusion- his voice is far weaker, and his songwriting at that time was also inferior.     The book seems to be more authoritative on dates, but we can only take Bill's accuracy on faith. My knowledge of the Stones is not enormous, but even I can see some big factual errors. For example he tells us that neither Taj Mahal nor Marianne Faithfull recorded songs for the &quot;Rock n Roll Circus&quot;. A recent re-issue has proved him completely wrong.      As another reviewer rightly said, Marianne Faithfull's autobiog is a much better read	0
B000EQRYMM:great_watch_at_the_best_price_i_could_find_anywhere.:william_k._thephasdin_"bboy360"	Great looking watch, and I shopped around for the best price for about three weeks before I ordered from Amazon. Shipped lightning quick also	1
B000BMAOIU:have_only_used_it_once_and_it_worked_fine.:lg	I only had a chance to use it once so far. It's been really cold and I have had no desire to go out there and check the air pressure of my tires. The only time I used it, it worked fine. This is my 3rd air compressor for the car. The first one was stolen from my car, but it got me out of trouble a couple of times. That's why I decided to buy the second one. It's a Craftsman unit that doesn't work any good at all. So I went online and did some research and read a couple of reviews for different units and decided to go for this one. The only thing I don't like is that you loose some air from the tire when you try to unscrew the hose. You just have to put two extra PSI's	1
B000E7DFH4:bought_this_at_office_max_for_cheap:karl_b_"karl_b"	THAT LASER IS VERY USEFUL. This model is the most expensive but is the best one. I kept going back and forth Office Maxto return other models of the same brand but this was it. I'm definitely not returning this thing. It's ergonomic; just pull down instead of pushing down. I get a straigter cut without the blade going out of wack like the other models of this brand. Worth every penny if you ask me. Especially if you make business cards.	1
B00006JZCK:wonderful_&_fun!:fun_aunt_in_ma	I got this for my 3 year old niece. She loves it and requests that it go with her all the time. The box to hold all the pieces is handy, the magnets are easy and there's lots of variations of outfits. Having 2 dolls makes it easy for friends, parents etc to play along and interact. The only cons I see is that the box with all the pieces is a bit heavy, it could use a handle. And the magnets are strong but sometimes the pieces slip a bit. All in all, a great gift and toy!	1
B0006I8I3C:doesn't_even_deserve_1_star_-_junk:rock_bottom	These glasses arrived yesterday and are the cheapest, poorly made, and most awkward glasses I have ever tried on.

B000FBMVXI:great_tasting_cereal-good_price:k._heeth_"kheeth"	Hearty, great-tasting cereal. Has a whole grain flavor. Originally looked at it because of lower carbs than other cereals (which is better for my reduced carb diet). But it has quickly become a favorite cereal and buying six boxes at a time through Amazon.com nets out at a lower cost per box than buying it at local grocery stores.	1
B000CR1YOM:great_treats_for_vegetarian_/_vegan_dogs!:andreas	These are great: our vegan Golden Retriever seems to *love* them (and is very healthy); the cows, pigs, & chicks are pretty-darn happy she's eating veggie-treats; the treats are organic; and Newman's donates the profits to charities!  Now that's a win-win-win-win!	1
B000002IQP:not_the_best_choice:dan_allen_"dk_collectibles"	This is simply a transfer of the LP master done when CDs were just getting started. The quality is inferior to other collections and the selection is weaker. Go for the Collectables twofer instead. Much better sound and more cuts	0
B000GK2WWI:poor_support:dr._james_m._brown_"drjimbrown"	This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet	0
B000EEZFEI:great_smoker:norm_w._reece	The Great Outdoors Deluxe Smoker is exactly what I was looking for.  The LP gas is great for easy temperature control.  All I need to do while smoking is periodically check the level of  liquid in the pan (and add more wood chunks if desired).  The temomitor is easy to read and appears to be made of good quality.  The only complaint I have is the smoker is not foam protected inside the cardboard box when shipped.  Thus, my smoker had two minor dents in the corner of the smoker.  They do not affect the operation at all.	1
441488	This magazine shows the negative side of black men. I find the magazine an embarrasement to the African-American community. It seems out of all the races of men in the world, black men seem to want to display their lack of self control, their love of  fancy cars, overpriced clothes, which in no way helps create wealth in our communities. And I am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover. Until, black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped, they will always be stopped by the police, be passed over for employment, and looked down upon. I wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community, showing respect and love for their women, and showing that everything is not hip hip!	0
B000FOMXSI:stopped_working_after_a_day.:l._herzog	My 5 yr. old son got this for Christmas and played with it only while we where watching (so we know he didn't do anything to break it).  The day after Christmas morning it stopped working...we changed the batteries that came with it and still it made noise but no longer would the shovel go up and down nor would it go in reverse.  I bought this from Toys R Us in our hometown.  I  threw the box away on Christmas day so I can't take it back.  I will try calling the company.	0

B00006G2OJ:problematic_and_restrictive.:michael_glenn	I've found the BEFSX41 (v2.0) to be very problematic.  With firmware version 1.50.18, some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every 5 minutes, bringing down the entire net.  With the newer firmware version 1.52.10 it fixes this problem, but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server (passthru tcp port 80), making the router totally unusable.  Tech support was friendly and helpful, and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to 1.50.18 for our websites, and upgrade each time to 1.52.10 whenever we had the need for distributed networking.  So now we upgrade/downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week, and each time we do it brings down our net.	0
B0002KVUKW:speechless:nodice	As cute and talented as I think Hugh Jackman is, this production was a waste of time, space and money. Everyone involved in this feature should be ashamed of themselves.  The acting is bad, the script is horrendous and the CG people apparently think their stuff don't stink...which it does-badly.  It's not the worse movie I've seen, but it's surprisingly close.  Please don't waste your time with this film	0
B000002H7Y:where_have_all_the_great_bands_gone?:michael_butts	Lead singer and co-founder David Gates was recently inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.  This album is one prime example of why.  David has consistently provided beautiful melodies with easy, sensitive lyrics.   His last album was a country album called &quot;Love Is Always  Seventeen,&quot; which was a genre-crossing mix of pop and country,  co-produced and performed with Billy Dean.  But back to this gem.   &quot;Guitar Man,&quot; and &quot;Aubrey&quot; were the big hits off of  this album, and they still stand the test of time.  &quot;Tecolote&quot; is  one of their most unusual departures, and still makes me laugh, while  enjoying its musicality and orignality.  &quot;Didn't Even Know Her  Name&quot; is a poignant lost love song; &quot;Welcome to the Music&quot;  is one of those opening songs bands sometimes did to orient their fans to  what to expect.  Even Larry Knechtel gets in on the vocals with the  intriguing &quot;Picture in My Mind.&quot;  It's a great album---in fact,  there's not a bad &quot;Bread&quot; album out there!  Enjoy, and relive  those magical moments of the glorious seventies	1
141724	MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to  destroy everything in his path, and school armys with one huge battle machine. Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well. But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs, then you would throw it aside not play it again? No. Not if you have Xbox Live. In Live you can play Capture The Flag, download new Mechs, and play with hundreds of players just like you, and you will always come back for more. If you don't have Xbox Live or a system link, that your wasting your money.	1

B00005A3L1:it_saved_the_day!:j._davis	This is a great device.  It fits with what I read about performing automatically a couple of things that beginners have trouble with.  In my case I had lost my wedding ring in the yard while raking leaves.  The long story resulted in a happy end when, after wondering if the device really worked after an hour of frustration, I tried a different area I KNEW that the ring could not possibly be - and the device went off LOUD AND CLEAR - and there the ring was!  I am quite happy that the automatic adjustments make it an excellent beginner metal detector	1
B0007ZF3GO:creating_keepsakes_scrapbook:suzanne_w._mounts	Creating Keepsakes Scrapbook Designer Version 2 Deluxe - This seems to be a nice program, but I have not found much use for it as of yet.

When I got mine today I tried it out and it barely lit up the palm of my hand. Had to smack it twice when the light flickered off to get it to come back on. It is flimsy, the light is dim and it's not worth the wait. Go to Walgreens instead. Mine is now lighting up the bottom of the trash can	0

B000G7VI1W:love_it!!:denise_l._twite_"busy_mommy"	I was a little skeptical because of the affordable price but I gave this set a try and love it.

B0002VJKT4:piece_of_junk:jag	I have gone through 4 of these in the last 6 months.  It used to be only $6 each so it didnt matter too much (Nextel sells theirs for usually $15-$20).  This is a cheap knockoff.  But if you are looking for a temporary fix or just dont care how often you replace them, feel free to buy this item.  Now that they have raised the price to $10, I'll probably not buy this anymore and get the better one at Nextel	0

B000K3L7KO:incredible_flexibility:paul_bobbitt_"pobbit"	This camera is very similar to the Fuji F30, but has face detection (fd) that autofocuses on faces in a photo.  Great for taking pictures of yourself, or for snapshots you don't have time to compose.  Excellent quality photos in dim light. At 3200 ISO, photos are washed out and noisy, but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss. Option to limit ISO to 1600, or to 400. Camera will use any speed up to the limit. 400 ISO is extremely good. As good as my Canon Digital Rebel xti. Usual modes I never use (flower, landscape, etc.), but one unique mode I use all the time: no flash/flash. The camera takes a picture without flash up to 3200 ISO, and then takes a picture with flash immediately after. Usually takes less than one second to capture both images. No flash doesn't surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot, while the following flash guarantees you'll get the image, even if the "warm glow of candlelight" is ruined. I always have the camera set to this mode. Uses xD cards, which I hate, but if you buy a 1 GB card you'll be able to take 400 - 500 photos without ever needing to change the card. Also, battery life is unbelieveable! Fully charge the camera over several hours, and you'll be able to take 400 photos, half with flash, before the battery is drained. Fuji-brand underwater housing is optional, watertight to 40m (121 ft.) Camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non-blue colours, and still keep the intense blue of the water. Literally *every* diver should have one of these cameras. I recommend this camera without hesitation. There simply isn't anything else like it on the market.	1

B000056HMB:mixed_review:courtney_o'brien_"elva's_mom"	I agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately.

B000KX0IMM:bad_screenplay,_bad_acting,_directing,_editing,_nothing_but_bad:none_whatsoever_"don't_waste_your_time_to_comment"	ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.	0
B000C20MU4:great_doll!:	This doll rocks! I love her hair, it's a dark reddish color and it's curled into seperate locks. And her dress is gorgeous! It's a powder pink color with long sleeves, and at the hands it has a big ball of white feathers. The necklece she has is very pretty, and so is her crown. Shes quite durable, and would make a great addition to any collection or toy chest	1

B00003CWFI:these_a/v_cables_are_worth_every_penny!!:reuben_k._"r.k."	Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!	1
B0002CZYIY:great_mic!:mario_e._guthrie	Well i don't have much to say.  Anyone who does a lot of vocal performance sees these suckers everywhere.  Not only are they terribly common, they are common because they are good sturdy mics.  Good sound quality!  Happy with mine.  Shure has been making good mics forever.  It's definitely a safe buy for  any performer, especially vocalists	1
B000MTDRDQ:amazing_score:seth_duncan_"film_lover"	First off, to the above comments, while I thoroughly enjoyed your well articulated history lessons, and would be interested to read other history lessons from you, you have to realize that this story is not directly based off of the 300 Spartans at Thermopolye, but of the Graphic Novel. Now this is not to say that it is historily accurate in some sense, but the movie is tuned more to the direction of the graphic novell itself.	1
B000BAV2HE:norton:raymond_j._peltier_"mountain_hiker"	I have 3 computers with different expiration dates for the installed Norton anti-virus programs.  I purchased the 3-pack and installed it into the computers as the old subscriptions expired.  I then found out that the clock for the 3 units started when the program was installed into the first computer.  When I contacted Norton, they acknowledged that it was designed that way and gave me a code to enter into the three computers in order to increase their protection to a full.  When the code was entered into the first computer the clock increased to 1 year in that computer.  Norton would not allow the code to be entered into the other 2 computers.  I will never purchase another Norton product	0

B000J54SI6:great_boots!:anonymous	I purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of Ugg-like boots. We looked in stores and other online shoe sites for Uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season, couldn't find her size.  We saw these on Amazon in her size and thought we'd try them out.  They were definitely worth it!  They are just as warm and comfortable as Uggs and since the price was so good, we were able to buy two pairs.  They are nicely made, comfortable, and attractive. She's wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable. She is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots	1
B00008DDU0:not_what_i_hoped_for:cecilia_r_"cecilia"	I'm a big fan of Colin Firth and I was disappointed of this movie, I felt sleep, wish I never do on an average good movie, I do not recommended if you've seen Bridget Jones diaries, not even close..	0
B000JK64B0:autoroute_europe_2007:r._a._cardon	If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how.	1
278346	I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out	0

260405	Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening?	1
B000F70OYK:1_star_taste_with_a_pretty_bad_smell.:danny_ocean	I bought these simply because I wanted an easy snack, and the reviews were pretty good. I took two bites and stopped. The second bite was because I really couldn't believe that I disliked something that much.	0

B000HCQKTG:real_digital_camera_in_a_cell_phone:gadgester	The K790a is currently the best "Cybershot" camera phone in Sony Ericsson's lineup (but more are on the way) and also hands-down the best camera phone in the U.S. today.  It's too bad that SE doesn't sell their 5MP and 6MP camera phones stateside.  But the K790a is very capable as a digital camera.  Sure, it's only 3MP, but like many professionals will tell you, pixel count is only one thing.  This 3MP camera-in-a-phone takes better-looking pictures than 5MP and 6MP cameras from Vivitar, Aptech (sp?), Samsung and other offbrand companies.  My main phone is a Sanyo M1 with 2MP and I thought it was pretty good for a camera phone, but when I got the K790a to use with my prepaid SIM card, I was simply blown away by the quality.  (Of course, I bought the phone exactly because I had heard of great things about its picture quality, but the results still far exceeded my high expectations.)  The camera is very easy to use.  I don't care for the MMS features because my prepaid service (Speak Out Wireless) doesn't support them.  I just download them to my PC using a USB card reader.  I wish there were optical zoom (more and more camera phones in Japan, including models from Casio, now have optical zoom) but the truth is of course that if you need serious picture-taking you still use a real digital camera.  But this comes real close to replacing your workhorse digicam.  I'll use this for a year and upgrade to SE's next gen next year, hopefully by then they'll have released optical zoom-equipped K phones.	1
B0000DI1J5:tea_of_the_gods:robert_l.	I hate to use this word, but this product truly is ORGASMIC. It comes out perfect, cup after cup, having a creamy yet zingy taste. The first time I tried it was at Einstein Bros. Bagels (the use the concentrate themselves to create &quot;their&quot; Chai Tea Latte). When I first tried this, I exclaimed to myself, &quot;WOW!!!!&quot;. Any person I have ever served this to was willing to vouch that their tastebuds were in sheer ecstasy.	1
B0007XPS98:think_you_don't_like_tea?:leeanne_goen	Market Spice Tea is the name of the signature blend and the tea company that has been producing it since the early 1900's in Pike Place Market in Seattle. It is black tea flavored with cinnamon, orange peel and essential oils. It is naturally sweet but contains no sugar or sweetener.	1

B0007P4BGM:very_nice_watch:pugtails	This is a very nice watch.  It is smaller than it looks in the picture, but I actually like it better that way--it is delicate and lady-like.  The pink face is subdued and the steel band is polished.  It makes a nice dressy or everyday watch.  I have seen similar Seikos in the stores for much more money.	1
B000290ZFY:buyers!_beware_of_lexar's_rebate_claims:a_former_lexar_customer	I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again	0
0753100169:concerning_the_unique_and_supreme_lodge_of_the_elucidated_brethren_:e._a._lovitt_"starmoth"	Time to pack up my luggage (wouldn't it be nice to have a suitcase like Rincewind's?) and take off for Discworld while the rain and gloom of a January thaw engulf the northern hemisphere.  "Guards!  Guards!" is the eighth book in the Discworld series, in which Captain Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks).  I don't read the Discworld novels in order any more, just pick up a favorite and start in.	1
B000A1AF8Q:i_love_this_car_seat!!:liza_m._brady	Our 8-month-old daughter outgrew her infant carrier, and we needed a "big girl" car seat immediately.  I knew that we were going to purchase a car seat made by Britax because they are always consistently highly rated in crash tests and by other safety measures.  After reading reviews and checking out the Roundabout, Marathon and Boulevard seats in the store, we decided on the Boulevard.  I love the added protection the side-impact wings provide.  True, it is just about the most expensive car seat out there, but I believe it is well worth the price.	1
B000CC9V42:spicey_flavors!_:possum_wilson	A fabulous variety of hot sauces with a range of flavors and heat. I bought it for a gift for my brother so I ended up sampling, using them myself. Truly flavorful! And hot! I use it in my omelets. Burritos. Nachos. Beans.	1
B000BUUVTO:a_big_step_backwards..._don't_be_fooled.:joe_sixpack_--__slipcue.com	I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.	0

213323	Miller knows his subjects (the people) and his subject (their desperation) with a clarity and fearlessness that most people would prefer to avoid.  Viewing his photographs are no easier a task than living  wholly and honestly.  Skinheads, speedfreaks, Tenderloin whores, friends and neighbors.  Lucid, terrifying, and ultimately beautiful photographs from a man of the same qualities	1
B000BL279A:love_the_aveda_shampure_shampoo_&_conditioner:leslie_a._maxin	I *love* this formula for my thick, naturally curly, slightly hilighted hair.  It does a great job cleaning without stripping, and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down.  I did get a good deal at my salon - $9 for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner	1
B0000530BN:dr._scholl's_foot_cream_was_excellent._it's_a_...:	Dr. Scholl's Foot Cream was excellent. It's a rich overnight foot cream with a pleasant smell. My feet felt softer in the morning after using it at night and I noticed a difference immediately in my dry, cracked heels. I also ended up using it on my hands and elbows before I went to bed. Especially my hands were really soft in the morning. I've tried other foot creams and not been really impressed. But I think the difference is that Dr. Scholl's has no alcohol in it, and it's really rich so you can actually feel the moisture in your skin	1
B000679NP0:you_will_regret_buying_this!:anonymous_guy_"big_guy"	Like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  I run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  Total waste, not worth a dollar.	0
0618574239:excellent_field_guide!:	The color tabs really help you know what section to look at. The only disadvantages of this field guide are that it doesn't document every species in North America and that the new National Geographic Field Guide to the Birds of North America, Fifth Edition has the Blue Grouse split into the Sooty and Dusky Grouse making it more up to date!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1

B0007OD8SU:don't_know_how_we_did_without_it!:lorna_doone_"sleepy2002"	We have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it! The peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless. I used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly, and I do not miss that. I can cook dinner or watch a TV show in a relaxed state without worry. It has always worked well, and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately. The picture is clear, the sound is excellent. You do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in, but the cords are all generous in length.	1

First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived!	0

I was extremely skeptical (and probably wouldn't have bought one) until I was able to try a colleague's mouse and see for myself how comfortable it is.  The ONE thing - and it's a pretty big thing - is the lack of "scroll-wheel" technology.  That's a sorely missed feature in this mouse.	1
B000A16ZO4:not_long_enough_to_actually_block_sun:ann_j._burtleson	I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes.  The ad said "universal fit".  Well, it fit, but second size up  car seats are taller and kind of lean back.  When you attach the canopy, it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun.  A hat better serves my child then this aparatus.  It now sits in the garage with all the other failed  baby devices	0
B000ASB664:a_light_weight_bench:v._ellison	This bench went together quickly.  All the parts fit well and the instructions were decent.

Craftsmenship of the parts themselves seems to be pretty decent.	0
B000BC1XIK:its_really_picnic_set:m._b._depouli	I was shopping for a new lunchbox for my son and thought this might be good.  When it arrived it turned out to be much too large for a boy's lunchbox and more for a picnic box for 2-4 people.   I kept it anyway for picnic use and bought a smaller one for his lunch.  The Pranzo is great for a picnic but it is mislabled as a lunchbox	0

Like most of us, I was interested in the Bose sound yet put off by the prestige price.  Even on E-Bay the going price ended up being around $400 -- for a used older model.  So I did some research and stumbled upon a nice comparison-shopper article that put the Bose up against several competitors, including this high-end TEAC.  I have to say that I'm entirely satisfied.	1
409234	I bought this CD after I'd watched the movie the first three times. The music is wonderful.  I bought it specifically for the song they sing in the church scene - "I Don't Care to Stay Here Long" and I want it played at my own funeral way out there in "someday".  You can't hear it without smiling and the words are much easier to understand on the CD than in the movie.  But just in case, here's the first foot-stompin' verse:	1
B0008EZBDO:the_mediterranean_does_not_smell_this__wonderful:wendy_c._jones	This fragrance takes you on holiday to a place you may never have been.

I simply can't get enough of Un Jardin en Mediterranee.	1

B00068O7LE:not_what_i_was_hoping_for:lisa_gump_"home_ceo"	I am such a huge fan of the Philosophy Grace line that I thought I would really love this, too.  I find that it is much too light for me.  It does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  I guess I'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice I'm wearing it.  Nobody has said anything so far.  The shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  I will stick with Amazing Grace, Baby Grace and Pure Grace.

B000F38I10:don't_buy_this!:t._hoffnagle_"thoffnagle"	When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth	0

You can't even distinguish the words half the time, just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor - he doesn't possess the skills to carry it off. This music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language...Sting, for all his merits, hasn't got that in his repertoire yet.	0

He has been using it up to now, and I used it this week for the first time.  Our daughter is 9 1/2 months and 21 pounds.  It was easy enough to get it on and off my back alone.  The problem is the horrible pain it caused while walking and the excrutiating neck pain I have after just a two mile walk!!!  I can't wait to get rid of this and buy a quality carrier that allows you to enjoy a walk!!!  I would NEVER recommend that someone buys this!	0

B0006TN00W:shipping_too_slow:sherryd	While the product is what I wanted, the shipping was too late.  The original shipping indicated that I should have received my pepper in time, but the shipper got the product to UPS late, therefore, I didn't get to use the pepper in the recipe and now I'll have to wait for another time to use it	0
403753	I love InStyle.  I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle.  It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion.  It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas.  It sticks to fashion and I like that.  That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will.  The best out there.  MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue.  I love it	1
256172	I bought the natural flavour. Didn't find it very palatable the first time. But the next time was much better and now I am hooked on to it! An acquired taste, indeed! The 11-ounce is difficult to down in one go, though.	1
86740	In the ten minutes since I've had it out of the box two pieces have fallen off.  More importantly, It can't handle large manuals as advertised.  (The reason I purchased this particular book holder)  My 1000 page manual only fits if you happen to only want to read the middle chapter.  Based on that I estimate that this is a totally worthless product to anyone needing to go through a manual or training book more than five or six hundred pages.  If you don't anticipate needing it for a book that big then just glue the rubber feet on, keep an eye on the page retainers (these are the parts that fell off) and you should be ok.  As for me, I'm off to read Amazon's return policy and see if I can get rid of this useless hunk of plastic	0

B00042YKVE:"water,_wind_and_fire...will_take_our_spirits_away":d._knouse	The music here frequently reminded me of Pagan's Mind with a touch of Porcupine Tree and flashes of Iron Maiden.  A fantastic mixture of 1970s Progressive rock bands such as Yes and Kansas molded with European-style Power Metal and Brazilian folk music.  While this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don't quite mesh.  In actuality I give the CD 4.5 stars for its superb songcraft and inspired, sometimes flawed ambition.  But as an overall package, this Special Edition of "Temple of Shadows" is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus DVD holds a concert in 5.1 surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog.  This is a great album filled with high quality Progressive Power Metal and a DVD concert that gives a taste of their other albums (not to mention it's just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves, smiling throughout the show).  Highly recommended.	1
B00009YQX2:not_impressed.:mercy_donovan	I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced.	0
B0007LQKN8:cute_faucet_cover!:j._perri	I've had the Hippo faucet cover for over six months and I think it's great! My son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt. It is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise I think it's worth it!  The only problem I found with the Hippo cover is that it doesn't really dispense bubble bath well.	1
585849	Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought.	0
B000E5BJS8:image_is_misleading:vivek_komarina	The image in this product is misleading. It looks like this product contains more than 1 piece, but when I opened it I got only one piece which is very small size and also the quality is inferior	0
284653	I know I'm a little late, but what the heck? I felt like writing a review for this game. Final Fantasy X is just a fantastic game. Simple as that. Its extremely deep, has a fantastic story, great characters, great battle system, and it's the perfect length for a RPG (45-55 hours). Not everyone likes Tidus, be he honestly doesn't bother me, and I think he is a interesting character. The rest of the cast is well developed, and they all have interesting personalities that are distinct to this universe. The cast is very memorable, you'll remember them for years to come, and I think that speaks volumes as to how good this game is. Its enhanced by the usual good voice acting that Square is known for, so that doesn't disapoint.	1
B000BBAGD4:not_what_i_expected_at_all...:gracie_"amazon's_biggest_fan!"	This step sucks.  If you are used to doing step classes at the gym, you will find it difficult to switch to this smaller step.  I didn't know it was a smaller step or I wouldn't have bought it.  It is hard to adjust to the shorter step, especially when doing a turn step or V step.  It ends up being VERY close to a basic step.  I was so nervous about stepping too close to the end and flipping the whole step up, that I was cheating myself out of a full workout.  DO NOT buy this, if you're used to the step at the club.  I feel like it's more dangerous on this, and ended up doing a lot of the steps on the floor.  If you already know that you like to step, buck up and buy the club size step, even though it is twice the price of this one.  Otherwise, don't buy anything	0

At first this toy was a little fun and I was optimistic about getting it to handle correctly.  I'd adjust the top screw to trim it from spinning clockwise or counter clockwise and everything.  This gets old after doing it every time after a charge. Next, using the forward and backward control doesn't work that well. Also, it will drop out of the sky or do something weird every now and then.  All in all I wouldn't buy it again, especially at the higher price it is currently going for.  Try the smaller havoc, it seems to handle a little better (Youtube has a few movies of it flying).  [...]	0

471510	Earlier, I had an LP called "Best of the Band" that was 10 cuts and maybe 35 minutes. This is 18 well chosen cuts and double the length. There are a lot of "best of/greatest hits" type collections from veteran artists that originally came out in 70's or early 80's that had a limited number of songs and length. This IS a case where the record decided to offer more songs and give the customer a better value for their money. The music itself is 5 stars and they were a major artist due to the fact that they had 3 very good but very different lead vocalists handling the vocals. It gives the music a lot more variety and they put out a lot of fine music in their 1968-76 prime. As an aside, 3 of the Band members (Helm, Danko, and Hudson) also put out some good music in the 1990's	1
444278	SOUND OF MUSIC 40th ANNIVERSARY EDITION (Fox) is the latest digital version of this beloved, timeless, film.

I Love the Bird and I Love the Song Bright Eyes. I would recommed this for anyone 8 and up. I don't think girls care for it as much as boys.	1
B000BU14C2:easy_stroller_for_travel:heidi	We bought this stroller to take on vacation and it proved to be easy to check at the gate of the airline, was lightweight, and continues to be a functional, comfortable stroller for our son.  The one feature that I expected to be different was how far the stroller reclined...it only slightly reclines so is not useful for a little one who needs to lay down further to nap while on the go.  I was happy with the amount of storage, but at times wished to have a storage compartment under the seat for my bag.  All in all, we are very happy with this purchase!	1
142956	I was looking for the Black and White Deluxe Version (with expansion pack) and came across this. I was a little hesitant in purchasing it because one of the reviews (by Computer Dude) said none of the games have activation numbers. Let me start by saying that this is not true. This is a little four page installation manual that tells how to install all four games (really five including the Black and White expansion pack) and on the back were all five activation numbers. I installed Black and White without any problems and was up half the night playing it. The only difference between these games and the originals is that all the documentation (manuals etc.) except for the four page installation guide, are on the game CDs. So if you are looking for a couple of these games this is a great deal and the information by computer dude claiming that their are no activation numbers was inaccurate	1
B0009NBBJM:oh,_the_horrors!:c._mccallister_"dr_dolphin"	Okay, I am no Master Gardener, but then, this is not a product for a Master Gardener. I am also not wanted for botanicidal rampages. I bought this right after it first came on the market, did everything according to the instructions, found the perfect spot, etcetera, etcetera. About ten percent, if that, of the seeds sprouted, turned into little green shoots . . . and died. This herb garden is marketed as simple, follow-the-steps, sit-back-and-watch-it-grow. Not in my Universe! The only thing I admire about Chia Pet, Incorporated (or whatever the parent company might be named) is their skill at marketing. Each holiday season, as their commercials flourish, I am tempted. Then, I recall the Great Disaster of 1999, and I resist temptation	0

B00009ADDV:anonomous:anonomous_"anonomous"	Absolutely FAB!!! Shiny-bright stainless steel, matches Frieling French Press, and any other stainless tableware/countertop items perfectly! Just the right size for serving a table of 4 or so...of course the sugar bowl holds plenty- note you'll likely need to refill the creamer for a second cup go-around at a table seating 4-6 coffee lovers. Overall these are just VERY sturdy/solid, clean-up beautifully and very easily, and, by the way, the sugar spoon included with the lid-covered sugar bowl dispenses an exact teaspoon of sugar, and sets inside the little 'notched' area of the lower bowl, so that the spoon rests perfectly inside the sugar bowl while the the lid remains covered/on at the same time- a really simple, yet European-engineered, well-thought out design & quality. I fully anticipate that this will be an heirloom hand me-down...although it's a l-o-o-o-ng time until I'll be distributing my assets! Make sure to buy the matching Frieling French Press- it's just incredible, & also heirloom quality! Give yourself the gift of European quality coffeeware- it's one of life's simple, yet indispensible indulgences!  PS the Frieling French Coffee Press w/ this matching sugar/creamer set makes a unique and favorite wedding gift too	1
B000K2GEJ4:be_warned:jonnyseed	USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).

B00006BT6D:a_dysfunctional_woody_allen_prior_to_therapy:randy_keehn	I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.	1
B00009MQ7U:best_automotive_publication_i_know_of:g._balch	I have subscribed to the all of the big car magazines for years, I am glad I stumbled upon Sports Car International in Australia of all places.  The articles are all well written and devoid of the mindless blather you find in most of the other rags.  I enjoy that they only write about interesting cars, I don't read car magazines to help me decide weather to buy the new Camry or the Accord, most of the other magazines cater to this crowd to one degree or another.  The photography keeps me pacing in front of the mail box waiting for the next issue, the shots of the Bugatti Veyron on the salt flats were the latest ones to blow my mind.  My only complaint is that the magazine  is bi-monthly, I would gladly pay twice the money to receive it every month.	1

1564555577:exceptional_guide_to_meditation_that_covers_everything:carolyn_elkins	I've read many books on meditation and while each of them answers some of my questions, Jack Kornfield's book, A Path with Heart, answers every one save those that must be experienced first-hand in one's own time.  His  voice and advice is articulate, intelligent, humorous, open, patient and  wise.  He starts out by telling you a little about his own experience, goes  on to cover the basics of vipassana meditation and then leads you bit by  bit deep into the issues every meditator and spiritual seeker must face.   What I love most about his teaching style is that he gives gentle,  practical advice on the day-to-day, minute by minute stuff to do to  explore, commit to, love being on the path.  If my house were on fire and I  had to grab only one book on my way out the door, it would be A Path with  Heart	1

B000J4FF9I:one_of_our_favorites!:uhohbaddog	I like a cup of coffee with character, and thus far this Black Gold Extra Bold has delivered.  The "Extra Bold" defines that this K-Cup carries an extra 20-30% of coffee per serving than the standard K-Cup, and as a result this delivers the extra kick that I tend to like.  We only brew at the 7.25oz, and sometimes the 5.25oz volume on our B-70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe.  This roast is on the dark side, and delivers flavor with intensity, and a nice smoky essence as described.  I also find that this provides a hint of crema, much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh.  We like it, and if you like stronger coffee, we think you will too!  Try it	1
B0009XH6WI:decent_dryer_but_needs_better_mounting_plate:d._l._sosebee	I purchased this dryer to replace an older one that is far too loud.   While this new one is much quieter than the old one, it really isn't super-quiet.  Still, I have no complaints on the noise, but the flimsy wall mounting hardware is another story.  The threaded holes in the mounting plate are extremely fragile, so much so that they both were wrung out during the initial mounting of the dryer.  It didn't help any that the mounting holes were extremely hard to locate once the plate was mounted - it's hard to see thru that white plastic shell.  I ended up having to discard the original threaded screws and use two slightly larger metal tapping screws to mount the dryer to the bracket.  This worked fine, but the original mounting hardware isn't very well designed in my opinion.  Other than that the dryer seems to work very well, although I haven't had it long enough to know how well it will last.  All in all, I'd give the dryer 4 stars out of 5	1

B000FBMW3M:very_soothing_and_great_tasting:cdswatch_"cdswatch"	I disagree with the other review that this tea has an unbearable scent.  I would say that the jasmine scent is strong, but not overpoweringly so.  If you brew it according to the producer's recommendation (steep it for 60-90 seconds), the result is good to great.  The tea is very soothing and the jasmine taste is very comforting.  The only knock is perhaps it leaves a little bit of an aftertaste, especially when the tea is cold.	1

384568	My husband is a big fan of this instant tea and always claims that it got rid of his cold/sickness right away. I have always thought that he exaggerated it until I was so cold and feeling really sick after a 2 hr working outdoor in the cold. The first thing I did after I came home was making a cup of hot ginger instant tea (which take me about 5 sec) and drank it right way. I have to admit, it is like a miracle!

218040	Playing Icewind Dale II reminds me of all of those novels written by American authors in the late 19th century. Though many of the novels were very well written, they never seemed to suck me in and continue reading the book. Icewind Dale II is like that. It looks nice, it supposedly improves gameplay, and it gives the player more character creation options, but I just don't really want to play it. Why? Well, at the end of the day, it seems as if Icewind Dale II is hurt by a extremely corny story; it is bogged down in numerous irrelevent puzzles involving you running around constantly; it is just not as fun as its predescessor.	0

B000BCICV6:interior_dream:lyn_smith_"lyn"	This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage	1

B000056QA8:the_plan_9_of_cannibal_films:dark_hore_dissent	If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few. One of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made. If Cannibal Holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films, then ferox is the plan 9.	0
B000KDOAPI:a_little_goes_a_long_way,_what_a_price!:a._kim	I purchased this product over the summer 2006 when I became concerned about sun damage.  My only question about this product is whether the vitamin C in it is stable (i.e., should the product be refrigerated to maintain its potency?).  Regardless, it has a sufficient amount of vitamin C for the product to be worthwhile (10% - woo hoo!), and other vitamin C creams are much more expensive.	1
371818	I've owned this software since it's ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception.  Even at it's latest 1.5.1 $299 version Apple should still be ashamed of themselves.  I use Final Cut Studio and own 3 recent Macs, so I've been devoted to Apple to say the least.  I am a professional wedding photographer/videographer.  I have been more than patient with this software.  It looks great, up to Apple's standards in design and vision but remains absolutely plagued with bugs.  And unless you pay Apple laughable amounts of money (much more than the cost of the software itself!), they will not provide support on anything except installation...even if there software update is the source of the issue.  As someone who has been such an Apple fan, I feel obligated to let everyone know that unless you enjoy pulling your hair out and repeating tasks over and over again do yourself a favor and DOWNLOAD LIGHTROOM FROM ADOBE.	0
257701	I have always been a fan of fighting games.  As far as 3D ones go, I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2.  I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though.  Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward* compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5.  Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur, the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd.  Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example.  Her idle animation is preposterous.  If you have access to Dead or Alive 3, try putting out Leifang.  Her idle animation is a thing of beauty.  Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next.  This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5.	0
B000068EY1:stopped_working:l._brittingham_"l_brittingham"	We used the machine once, and were disappointed by the performance.  The second time that we attempted to use it, it wouldn't heat.

574187	This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!	1
281206	Okay, first off, I'd like to say that this is my first AF SLR--I stepped up from my dinosaur of a camera, Canon AE-1 manual focus, and right now I am quite overwhelmed by all the features in this little thing.

B0006FHB6A:unsafe_and_dangerous:d._vance_"ninjaknittinggramma"	I bought this seat for my fifth child. She loved it at first, but then about the second week we had it, the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as I was putting her in it. Luckily I had not let go of her yet, because the whole thing fell apart on the floor.  The rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks.  Upon investigation, the company only offers a 15 day warranty and that does not cover "material failure". I will not buy anything else from this company.

I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody.

Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.	0

My daughter views Max and Ruby as such a treat that I used it as a potty training reward - and she's always just as delighted with it as she was the first time she saw it.

The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out.	1
499113	Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I.  Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used.  Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered for duty.  Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9.  Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program.  I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen.  But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.	1
B000FBQWLU:nice_tasting_sugar_alternative:ed__s.	I use this mostly in my coffee and tea and find that it adds a kind of sweetness that I enjoy. I've had others try it and some have liked it as much as I do, and others said it wasn't for them. I remember reading years ago that Stevia has a slight licorice taste to it, but I don't detect any of that sort of taste at all. My online research leads me to believe that that might have something to do with inulin fiber (FOS) thats also a part of this sweetener.	1

Also, some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base--just carry a washcloth with you--no problem.	1

B00000F0VW:one_of_the_best:devin_mcnally_"mcdevster"	Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films.	1
B0000CBL7X:a_bittersweet_story_of_bigamy:andy8047	This film released in late 1984,is about a married man named Rob Salinger(the late Dudley Moore) who secretly marries another woman during his current marriage. Rob is a newspaper editor married to Micheline "Micki" Salinger(Ann Reinking),a judge. While secretly romancing Maude(Amy Irving),he proposes to her(Maude). Rob has babies by both women and in one of the last scenes,they(the women) both meet and converse about their respective simultaneous marriages. But Rob keeps both wives. In the real world,bigamy is undoubtedly illegal. Director Blake Edwards' previous film credits include BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S and THE PINK PANTHER. Subsequently,he directed the late John Ritter in 1989's SKIN DEEP	1
B0002DI06Q:i_wish_i_would_have_bought_this_years_ago:bonita	This is an excellent product. If you are tired of lugging buckets of water back and forth while cleaning your aquarium, and making huge messes, walking in puddles, etc..and taking hours to clean even relatively small tanks, this product is for you. Don't waste your money on cheap suction devices, and buy the python today! (sorry if I sound like an infomercial, I'm just an enthusiastic user). The python attaches to your faucet, you turn the water on full blast, stick the suction tube end into your tank, and you can drain your tank in minutes, or just vacuum your gravel and do partial water changes. Then, you flick a switch and you can fill your tank back up (again, in minutes). I have 2 29 nine gallons and a 10 gallon, as well as a 15 gallon turtle tank, and what used to take me a whole day, now takes about an hour (to do all tanks). I like that I can vacuum the gravel, boy does this thing suck the waste up. This will also prolong the use of your filters and make your tank look great! I was skeptical that this product would work, but am so glad that I bought it. Now I actually enjoy maintaing my tanks instead of dreading it.	1

35772	Many albums, including this one, have the problem that all the songs pretty much sound the same; but this also has the troublesome problem of music that is too easy on the ears and that never gets very exciting - except for the first two tracks.  The use of many poetry elements in their lyrics can't save the blandness of the music.  "What About Everything" and "Life Less Ordinary" are good songs.  The rest pretty much sound the same and will put you to sleep.	0
B000GPQV3Y:great_while_it_worked:melissa_c._gabriel_"humanitarian"	I really enjoyed my Nano CHI iron while it lasted (RIP 7/06-11/06), it handles well, it's a great straightener, and it's a pretty color. However, I dropped it approximately two feet, onto a carpeted floor, and it stopped working. I purchased the CHI about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant. I'll still purchase CHI products, but wouldn't recommend investing in the Nano Technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, and it's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired	0

I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot.

It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera.	0
B00005RJ39:a_could_have_been.:roy_inglis	As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences	0
583370	This is perhaps my favorite Photography magazine. The printing is fantastic as is the subject matter. I really like the fact there are no ads in it at all. So many photography mags are just an extended catalog for B&H or Adorama that this is a breath of fresh air.	1
26329	Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)	0

B000BCHJRE:best_album_for_2007:	The progressive metal world better wake up and take note of this outstanding band that hails from Poland. These guys are a breath of fresh air with the oversaturated and stagnant progressive metal market that has developed over the past few years. So what do we get for our money you ask, a band comprising of well-schooled musicians, incredible song writing skills and the ability to weave so many different moods and time-passages into each song. There are a few scatterings of influences that aren't a major detraction from the overall mood of the album, namely Dream Theater, Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, Genesis and Anathema.	1

113899	I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.	0
399300	I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written.	0

B0001AV4RC:personal_preference:b._cohn_"booklust"	I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf	0
B000GUSFII:best_value.__the_logical_choice.:john	This model has all the features of the Elite 9500 (2 brush heads, 2 cleaning modes, programmable quadpacer, and a guage to indicate about how much charge is remaining in the battery), but it's $12 cheaper from Amazon!	1
B00004RHRM:sorry_i_bought_it:"techbooks_2000"	This grater is fine when you can get it to work, but most often the handle doesn't screw in correctly and you can't get it to. It's mostly a waste of time, though the concept is a great one. I'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one	0
B000002MMA:tevin_does_it_again!_:teisha_d._hillmon_"tdh"	I've always liked Tevin Campbell, he had a beautiful voice and really did it on "Break it Down". I particularly like Break it Down, Shhh, Brown Eyed Girl among others.. Excellent CD overall.	1
B000002JLG:heavenly_soulfull:class_of_'63	Just loved this CD!!!!  You'll be singing or humming this to yourself for hours after you hear it.  If you are 35 years old or older you'll LOVE it.  The memories will come flooding back to you.  Enjoy it!!	1
B0002JTUPU:good_product,_wish_there_were_more_size_variety:plain_roy	I'm taking off one point only because these pants don't have the short/medium/long choice as other BDU pants do.  I'm buying for a friend who prefers long inseam and regular waistline.  For other BDU pants I could have got him medium long which has waistline of 31-34'' and inseam up to 34-35''.  For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.	1
0070342849:every_active_pilot_and_future_pilot_should_read_this_book.:	Tony Kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  &quot;the best&quot; pilots around. His use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. In short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. For many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become &quot;old&quot; pilots.  If you fly, read the book	1
B000B8J8NG:defective_product_and_poor_service:so_cal_michael	There was a click in the crankshaft that was loud enough to be heard while riding and felt by the foot through the left pedal every 360 degrees of pedal rotation.	0
2766	Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.	0
B0000AS33O:works_great:greenroomsurf_com	I've owned this item for about a year and it works great.  Comfortble to sleep several days in a row on and never had a problem with it deflating.  I recommend this item	1
B00003XAKR:easy_to_use,_great_for_nighttime:john_denson	Very easy to use, and comfortable, it didn't bother my daughter when she was asleep. Stayed put pretty well considering how restless my daughter can be. Easy to change off the bed when wet without having to change sheets in the middle of the night. Washed about 30 times and still together and ready to use for my son next year	1
B000A3I2ZC:returned_it!:joanne_c._heckmann	What a disappointment - the reviewer who mentioned the difficult-to-use switch was right, it was a poor design choice.  Needlessly heavy too, with poor balance	0
B000E8UQKC:....looks_good_to_me:robert_of_niagara_"robert"	....will be given away as a gift. I am pleased. I hope the receiver will be.	1
B0007XGOVE:discontinued_for_good_reason:j._sheffield_"fuzzy_upper_west_sider"	Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is "fully charged" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back.	0
B0000DEZK1:works_great:the_finish_man	I installed this item on my 2001 Dodge truck shortly after I purchased my truck in Nov. 2000.  I have not had any problems with the unit at all.  My key fob has worn out, though it has seen some abuse.  I installed the unit myself using their instructions.  The install did take longer than I anticipated, but mostly because it sometimes took a bit to find the correct wire in the truck.  In all, it has great features at a fair price	1
B000BT8UAW:motorola_v170_battery:gary_d._smith_"hayman3347"	Works just fine! Delivery was earlier than predicted. I am well satisfied. I looked everywhere in two towns to buy such a simple thing but they didn't have them. I was told "they can order one". I thought to myself.......so what, so can I. This was much easier. I ordered it one evening while wearing my pajamas and it came right to my door----no muss, no fuss. This is the way to buy such items! Thanks for a great job	1
484216	My daughter received this as a gift & we all found it extremely difficult to use.  I was not able to play most of the activities on the screens without first getting the handbook out & doing step by step which was still not very easy to figure out.  It was not at all easy for a child to enjoy.  There were very few activities my 6 year old daughter was able to understand & play. It is too advanced & difficult to use for the ages listed.  The screen on the monitor was low graphics & poor lighting quality as well.  This is a very expensive mistake that provided no benefit or fun to my daughter	0
528582	What a great upbeat book that still covers the struggles of a child of a divorced family, living in poverty, and being of a mixed race.  Great great read with a great ending that wasn't to unbelievable.  It left you with a good feeling even though the struggles of the children were very real.  Great life lessons as well as cultural lessons in this book	1
133853	For me, the LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock is of little value.  I talked with a friend living in Colorado who is very satisfied with an equivalent clock, but I am in New York and much further away from the transmitter and it just doesn't work to my satisfaction.  When it was first put on the wall in the kitchen and didn't work for several days, I contacted technical support.  They suggested I put the clock in a window.  I followed their suggestion and after 2 days the clock was set correctly.  I moved it back to the kitchen wall and now 7 days after the change to daylight savings it's still on eastern standard time.  I didn't purchase this clock to hang in my window.  I need a clock in the kitchen.  As soon as I can find a suitable replacement this one is going into the garbage where it belongs	0
B0007GCY38:too_complex_for_"express":robert_cozzi	Isn't this a Mac product? I thought Mac products were supposed to be (A) stable, and (B) easy to use.  This product is stable, (once I upped my RAM to 2GB) but at 512MB it brought the system to a crawl.	0
B00064NYXU:okay:s._lowy	I was so anxious to get this and when I finally did, my daughter was just  not that interested with it. She barely plays with it. I was hoping that with this she would spend  more time on her tummy because she normally hates that. Maybe that's why she didn't care much for this.	0
238665	I'm puzzled as to why anyone should pay $59.39 for these three DVDs that currently retail on Amazon for $11.24 (Signs), $14.99 (Unbreakable), and $26.99 (Sixth Sense*) totaling $53.22?	0
B0006U2PHK:landmann_model_28335_big_sky_fire_pit_stars_and_moons:southpaw	The Firepit was exactly as described and of good quality.  Arrived faster than promised.  A quality item to get and enjoy an evening with the family roasting marshmellows.	1
B00003BE37:amazing_concert!:	this dvd is one of the best i have seen. only britney spears live tops this in picture quality.ricki sings his best songs in front of new york city backdrop. he put alot of energy into this concert.the sound quality is the best and picture quality is also great. a little bit less fuzz on some objects would have been nice! but still its great and colorfull with all the lights on stage	1
B0008GHUXQ:what_a_rip_off:kelly_e._solovey_"mommybychoice"	We purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much. I expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed. The mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head	0
B000JOQMO0:come_scented_too:cam	Other parents told us about these, specifically the vanilla scented ones.	1
B0009VFDNE:mmmm._pork_skins_and_cow_hooves:scott	Hydrolized Gelatin is the 3rd ingredient after the chocolate coating and protein blend.  Do a search on that and you'll discover that it comes from processing pork skins and cow bones.  Mmmmm. Doesn't that sound good?  What's more - this gelatin protein is incomplete, so it doesn't really do anything to help grow or repair muscles.  It may taste OK, but you can find protein bars with higher quality protein in them. Or just eat Jello if you really want gelatin.	0
B000GXCYFU:excellent_item,_she_loved_it:brandon_peery	Great item, don't go looking for huge diamonds, but it looked good over all.  And my girlfriend loved it so I guess that's the most important thing	1
B00000JWWG:red_desert_withstands_the_sands_of_time:	Sure, the pacing is slow compared to today's hyper/cyber entertainments, but Antonioni's visuals are still incomparable.  Scene after scene resembles nothing so much as a Matisse canvas, and the final shot is a  stunner.  Lovely, achingly felt picture	1
B00006950Q:say_no_to_dubs.:chris_neilson	Even though fans of HK cinema have as a whole come a long way since HK films were generally only seen in the states on Saturday afternoon television, some studios are still refusing to provide buyers with the option of seeing HK films in their original language with subtitles.  This film is available from Columbia Tristar only in a dubbed format, and for that reason I won't be getting the Region 1 release of this film	0
B000IU1182:why_pay_for_the_software???:kathy_weber_"keeshond_lover"	I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.	0
B000GI0HR2:same_as_2004:megan_"nutmeg"	I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.	0
B0009QYTIE:i'm_so_glad_they_make_this_in_a_large_size!!:mel	My baby outgrew the regular sized Swaddle Me at 2 months of age.  I ordered this one and when it came in the mail I couldn't believe how huge it looked!  We didn't actually use it until about 2.5-3 months since it was so big.  We would fold the top down before we swaddled our son in this so it wasn't as long.  At 3.5 months, our baby weighs 17 pounds so it's hard to find something to swaddle him with, and he still needs it.  I hope he doesn't outgrow this one in the near future.  I think he'll be one of those kids who has to be swaddled till he's 6 months old and this blanket should work	1
B00029KWMA:worst_feeling_lip_gloss_ever!:e._koresko	My sister-in-law bought this product for me after I had admired the shade (Purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. I have used other MAC products before with great results, but was VERY dissapointed with this product.	0
B000FBQ5SU:strange_taste!:jacqueline_cooke	I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers.  I had very high hopes too as I use McCann's Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME - I don't think I could live without it, so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix.  There is a very weird taste, to me it seems like 'soapy' or something, but definitely not a pleasure to eat.  I've got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away.  I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product, sorry	0
B000FVW4OY:delicious_gift_basket_addition:patricia_e._conroy_"collectible_one"	I used these to add to a Christmas Gift Basket, filled with Special Cocoa Mix, Spiced Tea Mix, Fancy Jam Spread, and three or four Scones, for family and friends....and unexpected company.  Everyone loved them, and I had apackage or tow left for myself....and they are delicious. They are such a good value for the money, and an exdciting addition for these gift boxes	1
B00006OP9C:logitech_freedom_2.4_ghz_cordless_joystick:craig_a._osterday_"caosterday"	Excellent product - very ergonomic, easy to set up and use! Wireless works great.	1
B000H0VAV6:_dvd_put_it_on_dvd:gary_eakin	I DONT WONT TO DOWNLOAD IT I WONT IT ALL ON DVD THIS IS WASTE MONE	0
B000EJV5N8:overall_jumps_great,_the_light_is_nice,_takes_a_while_to_inflate_a_tire...:scott_hill	I ended up getting a total of 6 of these units for all the trucks at my work. Overall they work fairly well. No problems jumping our work trucks. Chevy 1500 work trucks and a couple ford F150's. The light comes in handy. The air compressor does take a while to fill up a tire, and the hose is kinda short,but it does work. Other than that, it works great and has a built in battery tester which is nice to see. I have no problem getting multiple jumps in between charges. It recommends charging them once a month even if you don't use them. 4/5 Star	1
B00004SABJ:worst_binoculars_i_have_ever_owned:arren_d._dorman_jr._"specializing_in_cold_hard_facts"	The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.	0
B000659KDM:one_great_grill:d._cervera_"movie_addict"	I've had this grill for one summer now, and cannot say enough good things about it. Ours was recently blown off the patio by a particularly nasty windstorm and survived without hardly a scratch. For those concerned about the price: when you look at all the extra features - not just the ignition system, but the work table, the charcoal bin, and the tool rack - it really is worth every penny. Plus consider, for this price, what sort of gas grill could you get	1
222834	when i started playing this game it was hard for me to stop i play it every chance i get and the best thing about it i got it for far less money from amazon.com	1
B000JJJDFA:men's_black_dress_vest_necktie_set_for_suit_or_tuxedo_xxxl:barbara_fischer	This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what	1
B000FE76AI:never_received:christine_m._andrews	Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT!	0
394018	There are plenty of anti-Bush films and books around. If you only shall see or read one, this must be the best pick. I like Michael Moore very much, but he is not really a political heavyweighter. And i don't think Fahrenheit 9/11 is his best work, it does not mix humour and political insight as well as   the book "stupid white men" for instance. It is more like two or three movies in one.	1
B000B5TWJ4:slip_sliding_away:knitting_fan	At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0
B000004AZU:sound_like_an_artist_still_maturing.:robert_g._raynor,_jr.	When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style	0
B0002E1UNU:don't_drop_yer_pick!:o._lovitt_"clay212"	This is a great tool for when recording. It will hang right on yer middle finger and it's there still after pushin' a few buttons or what. AND it is a good pick. Not a replacement mind you but get one to have in the "studio".	1
B00005CDSF:don't_bother:me_and_my_baby	I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I'm trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews	0
B0007CXT6I:well_worth_it!:james_hutchings	After college I moved back home for a few months before getting my own place. It was totally a sitcom setup in that I lived in my mom's basement - but the mice and spiders down there were not funny at all. I didn't really mind the mice running around every now and then, but when one got under the covers with me, I had enough. I went to a local brick & mortar store and bought all kinds of different traps, deterrents, etc to try to get them out or trap them without harming the critters (Mom wouldn't have it). I bought a single two-pack of these things and immediately after I plugged the first one in, I saw two mice immediately come out of their hiding spot and scurry to the unfinished part of the basement. Having one in my bedroom and one in the bathroom in the basement was enough for me, but Mom's husband was so impressed that he bought about a dozen more for the rest of the basement (lots of separate rooms) and the garage.	1
B000BK8PQA:i_hate_this_mirror...thinking_of_contacting_fisher_price:julie_hite	I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car.  I thought the lights and music would distract him.  After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry.  It is far less irritating.  The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work.  What genius engineered that?  Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money!!	0
B000M0MRKE:good_quality_and_value:michaelm	Comfortable. If elastic waist degrades over time (not known yet, but has happened to other pajamas), there is no back-up draw-string. As with all flannel PJs, easily tangles with flannel sheets	1
B00002MZ6X:soccer_madness:	I think that the soccer ball is great but not that educational only because all you do is paint	1
B00004YUGN:rosetta_stone_german_level_1:disappointed	This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it.  Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless.	0
B0006OCI1Y:product_doesn't_match_description!:d._kane	The product shown does not match the description.  It is NOT the Marble Roller Coaster Kit. Please fix	0
B000G27DHA:a_quick,_easy_sanitizing_solution...:kelli_j._robertson_"speechteach_mom"	We keep this in our kitchen and sanitize dropped baby toys and pacifiers as needed.  It takes a 30 minute cycle, and you just put things in and walk away.  It hasn't damaged anything vs. sanitizing in the washing machine - and I don't have to worry about any chemical residue from spray sanitizers.  We've even started to use it on more things around the house like toothbrushes, etc. to periodically clean them.  I think it's great	1
B000FKHLD4:great_diaper,_but_delivery_takes_too_long...:jennifer_l._nitzky	These are by far the BEST newborn size diapers especially for small babies, but if you order them through Amazon, your baby may outgrow them before they even arrive!  I waited 5 weeks then cancelled the order and ordered size 1, which Actually arrived in a few days!	1
533330	JJ, the name of the song you are looking for is "Like You Like An Arsonist" by Paris Texas	0
256176	Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink	1
B000ABAYMS:try_them_before_you_buy_them!:m._willard	I'm a huge fan of the Pria line, but these are not like the others - they are heavier and a little grainy.  I don't hate them, but will not buy them again.  The flavor is pretty good though, just not what I was expecting.  I highly recommend the Pria 110 calorie line - the vanilla is my favorite but the peanut butter and others are close behind.	0
B00027907A:i_got_taken!!!:susan_m._degarmo_"gypsy_rebel"	Worst product on the market! A huge disappointment. I was very careful to use as directed. The result? One big mess! The lens were smeared and foggy with bubbles in them and I had no choice but to throw them away	0
B00004TX5N:horribly_miscast!:nik_city	Oh the HUMANITY!...	0
535420	Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.	0
B000I6R9A0:lip_smackin_delicious:michelle_m._langdon_"coderedlayla"	what a sinfully awsome tasting way to get rid of chapped lips	1
B00009OKO3:didn't_work_as_expected:v._singh	It has lot of problem, most of time it's cartridge will not be recognozed by Leap Pad.	0
B0007CQ6L8:unsafe,_unfortunately_your_options_are_limited:j._krystek_"amazon3168"	These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.	0
B000F3E7DS:very_very_disappointed...:e._lindblom	We bought four sets of the Victoria Collection 600 thread count queen size.   The fitted sheets do not fit on our queen bed.  It seems like that were made for a full size not queen size... list this as a reject.  We are VERY VERY disappointed	0
B000GFJ834:its_alright:j._baum_"chicken_chaser"	I ordered this gun because it was such a great deal. When it arrived, i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked (a big crack), nothing a little gorrila glue can't fix though. Also the accuracy isn't consistent, it is always about 4 or 5 inches off from about 20-30 feet. I had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate, otherwise it was 3 feet high. The pellet also starts to curve after 15 feet or so too. So this gun was a good deal but isn't the best quality gun i've had. You have to load it from the top of the gun, which means taking off the laser, putting in the bbs, and putting on the laser again. The magazine doesn't even come off! It still has decent speed, and isn't crap (it's just bad). It was worth 15 bucks though	0
B000BGMFFQ:awful:g._turner_"in_training"	I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports "Best Buy," and I expected to get a lot of use out of it. The frame broke on my first (I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week) after about 1100 miles, and its replacement just died after only 350 miles. So far I've paid about a dollar a mile. I'll never buy from Schwinn again	0
134382	The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.	1
B000G82GO4:kindof_dangerous:losdostweets_"losdostweets"	We were so excited to try a jumper for our son, but were very dissapointed in this product. First of all, he tipped himself right out of it!  With the three strap design, it's unsturdy in the back, which we discovered after he spilled himself onto the floor. He seemed pretty intent on jumping, so now we've tried stuffing him in there with a blanket so that he's nice and snug, but it's still unstable and wobbly. I don't recommend this product, and in fact, we are going to try a different brand	0
B0002APZ9E:this_product_is_evil:rosemary_amey	This container is way too small to keep any fish in, let alone two. In such a small container, the fishes' wastes will build up quickly, causing eye and skin irritation, sickness, even death. You can try to reduce the waste build up changing the water frequently, but not only is this a lot of work for you, it is stressful for the fish.	0
B000FW7IXK:appears_to_work_well:r._olmstead	Finally got to try this item out when my wife and I did some bar hopping a couple of weeks ago.  We delayed our drive home until the device gave us the all clear.  Of course the big question is whether the readings were accurate and without a calibrated reference device on hand, this currently remains unanswered.  Indirect evidence (our known consumption rate, body weight, and subjective feelings) suggested the device was in the ballpark.  Since I do have access to a more accurate (and far more expensive) tester at work, I may attempt some experiments and will report back the findings here.	1
B0001GU7Q0:i_returned_this_item...not_functional:linda_a._greenberg_"road_warrior"	This item was not practical. It looked good but not being able to zip the sides all the way down because of the cute water bottles was not very functional	0
B000JWIZH4:worth_every_cent!:jorge_diaz	I Really like this phone, the camera quality, the software, everything is excellent	1

B000CSBZLI:kodak_easy_share_-_is_easy!_(and_now_broken):asu_mom_"bestteachermom"	I bought this camera just before a trip to CA and then a cruise!  It is very easy to operate (even for a techno-retard like me) and the pictures turned out great!  I have started to use the filming feature recently as my Video Recorder is with my son @ college and I want to film my daughter's Drill Team performances!  I really like the fact that it doesn't turn on while in my purse!!!  My old camera did that a couple of times, and I ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse - anyone want one? (LOL) All in all, a great buy!  8 months later and the LCD display is gone!  Literally, GONE!  Don't know what happened - took pictures/movies of daughter's drill team performance, and when I got it out again to take pictures before Sadie Hawkins, it would still take pictures (I just downloaded them) but since the display looks like "a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side" I don't know what I'm taking a picture of!  Need to replace soon!  I'm (now) bummed	1

B000E433EW:delicious_spicy_corn_soup:coffee_drinker	Very good soup.  Easy to make and brings Latin American flavors to life.  Works well with any meal.  My only complaint is that it clumped after letting it sit for a minute, so I had to stir it quite often. But overall, a delicious soup that I will continue to buy & enjoy	1
B000E18CVE:so_simple_and_delicious!:n._schmidt_"shopalotta"	This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store	1

B0007RKD9E:keep_looking:a._mccollum	My sons got this toy for their 1st birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push/ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk.  While they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it, I do not find it helpful for development.  The handle pushes forward and comes off very easily, it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them, and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it.  Also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we've only had it a month.  For an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy, but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking, keep looking	0
6304244703:"shameless"_insufficient_use_of_jeremy_brett:bonnie_burton	I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist. It's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic Sherlock Holmes in the beloved Granada TV series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy. It's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman. Regardless, as usual, he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it. I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.	0
B00004RL2G:this_film_is_a_disaster:j._e._colon_"****************"	Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film.  It has the feel and tone of  the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.  The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film (when most of the musical scenes occur) are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.  Worse yet, the sets do not look like 1963.  This is very clearly a cheap production, doomed from the start by an awful script, terrible acting, and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era.  Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the Cruisers, has disappeared (he died in a car accident, but his body was never recovered), a reporter decides to write a story about the band.  She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.  She forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members, who are, by the way, dull as dirt, to piece together the band's history.  The reporter is so creepy and annoying that she'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her, nowadays.  Ironically enough, A Season in Hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience	0
B000B8P8T4:mac_version..._2_thumbs_down!!!:kelly_podzemny	This was my first time to ever attempt using a software program to file my taxes. TurboTax sounded easy enough. And it was pretty easy at first. The software interviewed me in an efficent manner and saved all of my information. But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all. I can't speak for this software on Windows machines. But if you are using Mac OS X, I suggest you explore other options first	0

When I first copied all the files to the drive it took a couple of minutes, but now I just make changes or updates to the individual files and the write times are short enough that I don't even notice them (just a second or two). I also seemlessly work on the files on both a PC at work and a Mac at home.	1

143143	I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description...	1

B000I1VJ6K:i_hate_this_camera:dennis_r._simpson	I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!!	0

Best lens in it's class at a reasonable price. It's well built, sturdy, and not so heavy so it's relatively easy to carry around. Canon really impressed me with this lens. I use it with my EOS system (traditional and digital cameras).	1

B000HLRAJG:not_a_good_program:daniel_paniccia	I have been a long-time ACT! user. My biggest complaint is recovery. If you have to move the email and database to another computer due to a failure you have to jump through hoops; that's just what one feels like doing when the pressure is on. I still can't bring my ACT! 2007 email over even though ACT! says it was restored successfully (empty folders!). They have a ridiculous technical support team unwilling to help unless you pay, pay and pay and their knowledge base must have been restored like my email: non-existent. The earlier versions were great. I agree with a previous reviewer that when they switched to SQL it all went downhill. I think I'll stick with anything else. It is really ashame. ACT! used to be fast, tight and clean; now it is clunky, lethargic and hangs for 20 seconds on all the time (for some stupid reason) running on an a 2.4 dual core AMD with 4GB memory. Even when Symantec had it they didn't screw it up, but now, you may be better-off sticking with the Palm Pilot contact management software--well, maybe not	0

86327	If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue.  Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into.  However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach.  I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue.  However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues).  Now THAT I can afford.  It is an unbeatable deal.  Will you glean anything from it?  Yes.  You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best.  Is it practical?  Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price.	1
B00064MULM:trainer_ring_doesn't_fit_every_seat:veronica_jijon_"mom_of_2"	Even though I think this is a very good idea (no mess to clean up like there is on a roaming stand-alone potty), the ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well. We have the oblong seats, not the round ones, and the ring slides back and forth, especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries to get up on it. It doesn't make her feel very stable so, so far at least, she has refused to use it	0

B000035P5R:innocence_meets_evil._:rodney_houghton	The story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles. It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is "sweet". In fact, the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension. A very good example of film noir	1

0141001992:chilling:erin_brooks_"erin_brooks"	Leah Stewart is a talented writer. I read this book after finishing her most recent novel, The Myth of You and Me (which I highly recommend). This story is dark and chilling. Olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in Memphis on a hot summer. When the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for Olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. The characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in Memphis is well rendered. I highly recommend this book	1

Sounds silly, but I love oatmeal and hate cleaning the pan afterwards.  This cleans up easily and cooks evenly.  I have used it for cooking rice, gravies and other foods that seem to stick and it always cleans up well.  Now, for the lid.  There is a black band on the inside of the lid and it scrubed off one night recently.  I sat down, wrote an email to the company and by the next day, they have a new lid on the way.  They asked only where to send it, nothing else.  I like companies that stand by the product they sell.  So, if you are going to buy from this line, check that black band, it should be between the glass and the metal, not on the inside of the lid.  If you have a problem with the product, ALWAYS notify the manufacturer, they will almost always make it right, like Calphalon did for me	1

562944	In all the talk about education issues these days, it's easy to forget that what's really important is the relationship, the energy, between students and teacher.  When the teacher closes his door and is face-to-face with thirty kids--THAT'S where it's at.  It's not test scores or textbooks or innovative curriculum--it's what happens between PEOPLE in a classroom.  This book shows that dynamic relationship between eager, active kids and a caring, active teacher.  It's not all pleasant, and successes are sometimes small, but a pervasive caring underlies it all.  As a teacher, this book reminded me that sometimes the best thing I can do for my kids is to leave all that paperwork, go for a walk, go to bed early so I can be there for them the next day	1

I thought at such a low price it would be a low-quality trumpet, but its really absolutely perfect for my first-time trumpeter daughter. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this. PLUS Austin Bazaar sent a nice information letter along with their shipping notice on how to take care and assemble your instrument	1
B000HLYPZI:no_software_but...:el_"el"	I ordered this USB cable for my Samsung SYNC and it came fast. While there is no software provided I quickly found out it syncs with Windows Media Player so I could add music to my phone. After searching I found that Samsung actually provides the necessary software on their website for FREE! If you want to fully utilize your Sync's camera and MP3 capabilities I highly recommend buying this inexpensive wire and going to Samsung's site for the free software	1

B000BIU1XC:awesome!_highly_recommend!!:a._mai_thai	I needed a nice bench for the entry but didn't want to settle for the same old bench like everyone else has so I stumbled upon this one and I love it!!!! It's well made and the cushion is very plush! The colors are perfect! Love it! If you are looking for a nice and classy bench, this is it	1
186827	I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.	0
B0001G6U5M:fatally_flawed:l._tseng	Beware of this camera! The camera overall works great. We have had it for more than a year now and it takes clear, bright pictures and is very easy to use.  Very nice compact size.	0
B000069EXQ:five_stars_is_not_enough:lauren_andersen	My son has been wearing the halo sleep sack since the day he came home from the hospital.  Being a winter baby it was the best thing in the world to know that he would be warm and not have to worry about loose blankets.  He began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old.  I think the sleep sack gives him a feeling of security.  He was never able to sleep without being in it.  He is now 30 months old and still won't go to sleep unless he is in his sleep sack.  We had to have a friend of ours who is a seamstress add additional material to the bottom because he became to tall for it.  That is how much he loves his sleep sack.  It is by far the best thing I ever bought for my son	1
B000M4KXEC:i_hate_this_camera:plntygood_"plntygood"	This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0
500502	Putting it simply, this film is the work of a genius. As a Tom Stoppard fanatic, I adored it from the moment I read the play, which was even the version he was considerably unhappy with. He was significantly more satisfied with the movie, and there is very little doubt as to why. He clearly had a handle on what he was doing and writing and with whom he was working.	1
B000CSCIG4:very_simple,_stylish:reddevil	My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this, but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up (which I LOVE the idea of).  It seems comfy, he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :	1
B0002SA9BU:so_far_-_results_noticed:shannon_giel	To start - I miss my hair. Last september I cut my hip length hair to mid back, and then in december to just at the shoulders, and then again to the chin in January - and from January through June I trimmed it regularly to keep it that length. (I've been getting rid of the henna that was in my hair - I couldn't get it out via any other method tried except "growing out"). My hair grows kinda slow now too - it used to grow faster, but I suppose everything slows down the older you get.	1

B000056C86:by_far..._best_on_the_market:luvmy2grls	I am a mom of three kids and this is by far the best Pack-n-Play on the market.  When #3 came along we needed to purchase a new Pack-n-Play.  The Graco Pack N Play with bug toys is absolutely the best we've ever owned.  The bright colors and cute toys make it a fun environment for our 8 month old.  She has loved the bright play mat since about 6 months, but now that she is sitting up she enjoys looking in the mirror and pulling on the rattle butterfly wings.  She actually gets excited about playing in her Pack N Play... and mom can get dinner cooked without interruption!	1

B000EALK8W:love_my_phone:moocow_"emma"	I just got my pink razr phone and I love it so far. i love that it is pink and it is diffrent from the other pink phones. Even though it does not have an antenna on the outside that you can see it ,still it works well. I was scared to buy this phone because I read some of the reviews and some of them weren't saying good things about the phone but I think that they were wrong about it. Great job motorola keep up the good work	1
B00006HOL1:static_producer:dee_"adees"	The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.	0
B0000DHGE5:nice_whisk,__but_wrapped:	I have some nice nonstick cookware that I needed whisks for, so I got these. My main reasons for choosing them were the brand, and the fact that someone in a review for another product said that these were all silicone, rather than silicone coated steel. Unfortunately that is NOT the case. This is silicone coating metal. This is acceptable though, because the 5-year guarantee will cover the whisk should the silicone decide to peel off, and 5 years of cookware-safe whisking for this price is worth it to me! The whisk is wonderful, and I'd recommend it to anyone. Just don't believe the reviews telling people to get this for the reason stated above	1
B00000FY3P:outstanding_quality_recording:	If you like the Beach Boys and appreciate the technical quality behind Telarc recordings, then this disc is a must have in your collection. First, Papa Doo Run Run does an excellent job covering Beach Boys tunes to the point where some people can't tell the difference, but you can still hear the uniqueness they bring to it. Second, you'll feel like your hearing parts of the music you've never heard before because there is so much more foundation and clarity to the recording. You can hear each instrument clearly. The beginning of &quot;I Get Around&quot; is almost explosive, they way the original recording should have been. Telarc and Papa Doo Run Run have made a special album here. When I feel like listening to the Beach Boys, I usually grab this CD first	1
B0002FGFIY:great_game:m._decker	I was amazed how colorful the graphics are in this game.  My 6 year took right to it and played it for 2 hours the first sitting.  She mastered level 2 pretty easy and is on to level 3.  Our computer runs windows and we have had no problems.  This is a great game to buy for the summer to keep kids up to speed between K and 1st grade	1
510604	Firstly, I have not seen the film adaptation of 'Single White Female' and so this review isn't tainted one way or the other.  This book, about the stolen identity of a young woman by her psychotic flatmate, is written is very easy style.  Characterizations, prose, and dialogue are all straightforward.  I can understand why a film was made based on it since the book reads more like a screenplay than a novel.  And the book's "feel" is anything but original.  'Sliver' by Ira Levin does a better job of capturing the essence of life (and danger) in Manhattan for a single, white female.  Still, 'Single White Female' is an entertaining read.	1
20522	I didn't think it was possible for the Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the States. Buy it	1
B000B625H4:awesome!:c._lin	The enclosure has a solid feel to it.  I dove with it three times with no problem at all. It would be nice if the weight does not cost extra.	1

B000ELIBUG:dvd-s32s:r._thomas_"rod"	Works as billed.  I am currently playing a DVD+RL that would not play on any other player.  I have not purchased a 1080P LCD TV, but it is why I purchased an upconverting DVD player.  I have tried DVD+R and DVD+RW.  I will be trying audio formats later.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is waiting for the HD versus BlueRay to determine which will be the dominant technology and for its price to come down	1
283450	This book is very disappointing, as is most of Gunaratna's work on islamist terrorism. It's the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear, ie. bin Laden and AQ are everywhere, responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups (such as JI) are AQ franchises - total bollocks. The book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a "scholar" who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary	0
160513	This man is like Michael Bay.  Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies.  The man is a joke	0
B00069FEVA:terrible_product:ashley_person_"k._xandria"	This tv only worked for three weeks.  Then, for no apparant reason, it suddenly would not turn on.  I sent it back to Coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it.  No one should by from Coby	0
B0000C5GDM:these_gloves_are_garbage:m._j._jarvis_"xavier4prez"	The padding is too bulky toward the knuckels. There is no padding on the fingers. The gloves are closed palm so your hands get sweatier faster. Overall these gloves are a poor excuse for grappling gloves	0
214680	I live in one of the "Red States" in the deep south.  Therefore, unfortunately, quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find.  But, fortunately, Yoga Journal is delivered to my area, providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that I have received through the years.  However I agree with other readers, I don't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ (who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice?) I also do not care for the models they use is this publication, most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the Senior Prom! There are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on Shiva Rea, Ana Forrest or one of the Iyengar family members but for the most part, this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young, skinny women, what a shame.	1
B000BU0B9Y:guys_who_love_this_film...speak_up!:zack_h._"darth_floyd-head"	This film seems to be known worldwide as a "chick flick", from the romantic aspects of it, to the current anniversary DVD's pink cover.	1

B0000AZJV8:pretty_powerful:d._mokhtar_"dbm"	Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way.	1
B000FDEVV6:not_as_manufacturer_describes:b._applegate	I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect	0

If you're gluten-sensitive, give this a try -- after I switched to a gluten-free diet, I was missing oatmeal something awful. I thought I would give this a try as an alternative, and was glad I did! With some brown sugar and raisins and a little imagination, you can be satisfied with this cereal	1

B000M06KJ8:terrible!:aj	If you've read the book this movies is EXTREMELY loosely based on, you will understand why the movie is so horrid. It's beautiful to look at, but that is all. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a Queen of France. This movie completely ignores the Revolution, Marie Antoinette's arrest, and murder. In short, the movie ignores anything that is not pretty, girlish, and light.	0
395062	Perhaps the long shadow of Francis Parkman has discouraged historians from writing about the French and Indian War (Seven Year's War).  Whatever the reason it's good to see from the publication of several books that Americans are taking a renewed interest in the pre-revolutionary period when the British were triumphant and the Indians still counted as a political force.	1
B000EXQZXE:don't_buy_this_for_the_compass:pk	This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	0
B000FQ9R9O:great_read!!:k._bernard	I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions.	1
B0002QX3SS:the_perfect_dog_toy:yakker	This could well be the perfect dog toy, especially if your dog is a Queensland Heeler with a knack for destroying plastic Frisbees, tennis balls, etc. in seconds flat.  I've had one for a couple of weeks now and, aside from some dirt spots, it looks new.  It is an unheard of feat for a toy to make it this long when exposed to the not-so-tender mercies of my dog's attention. This disc is not only very durable, it actually flies really well.  As something of a flying-disc connoisseur, I can't help but be impressed by how easy this is to throw and how far it carries.  Plus, it floats.  Perfect!	1

B000A32PNW:small,_compact:danielle	I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.	0
B000BMVDPI:comfy_all_year_long:thomas_a._hewlett_"newfietom"	These are comfortable slippers that -- with composite soles -- can take you out on the deck, to the front steps or even your driveway to pick up the morning newspaper. Your feet will stay warm but not uncomfortably so. They're even nice to wear when temps are a little higher because the clog design fits loosely at the heal so you can let your feet "breath" a little fresh air. Nice value for the price	1
B000GKVQDY:we_like_this_monitor:angela_mccarter	We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it.	1
B0000TG9Z6:boring!!!:queen_of_annwen	I liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well. The first one was well done and the acting great. The second one, was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining. This movie, however, was incredibly lame and absolutely boring.	0
B0007R72AW:poorly_designed:kelly_a._ellin	I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went.	0
B00006AUHB:as_time_goes_by_-_complete_series_3:c._myers	While I absolutely love the show on PBS, this season was mispackaged. The box and DVD were both labeled series 3, but when you view it the episodes are exactly the same as series 1/2. Unfortunately, I didn't try watching this disc until several months after I bought it. If you buy this, be sure you view it promptly to be certain it's the correct series	0

0823054802:dreaming:	I have not been able to put this book down since I received it.  I have always dreamed of visiting Italy, but until that time comes, I have been redecorating my home to reflect that dream.  I now have a &quot;Tuscan kitchen&quot; that makes me very happy to be in.  I bought this book for new ideas,and also to confirm that the elements in my home already are the correct ones.  I was thrilled to find these &quot;Tuscan elements&quot; such as pottery, stones, tiles discussed throughout.  And the photographs inspire me to pay attention to details.  It's all about the textures of the walls, the colors, how you display your ceramics....the pictures are beautiful.  I may not get to Italy any time soon, but this book helped bring my dream a little closer to home	1
B0001XE0IO:ny_times_deluxe_crossword:g._weiss	Mixed low review-  The single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions.  Unfortunately, that is a huge Achilles heal.  Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation.  I would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker (unless there is something wrong with mine, which I doubt, I would not buy this again	0
6303255175:decent_movie.........not_so_decent_dvd:brandon	Okay, so we all know the story about how the Ducks come from behind to win and how Coach Bombay gets revenge on his old coach for many years of bad memories.	1
B000BO6MBG:plenty_of_room:r._milroy	I bought this because I was moving from Boston, MA to Phoenix, AZ and driving myself and my 2 daughters.  I was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity- and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut.	1
83533	I've got to be honest, this game has been more entertaining than probably the last three games I've bought, not that they were bad though. The funny thing about these kind of games (so long as you're using a light gun) is that they improve your accuracy with firearms. It's no substitute for real shooting, but then again, how often do you spend hours shooting probably thousands of rounds like in these games? Now, on the game itself, the graphics are good enough, but the arcade style makes it look... well, not real. But then again that is part of what gives the game it's charm. Buy the game, and a light gun	1
B000FRTTVY:great_with_one_exception:susan_spilman_"sangmo"	Impressed with the way it clears out viruses, spyware, and Trojans---I can look at what it's doing or just let it do it. That all goes well. What I don't like is it requires a password for everything even my usual automatic sign-me-in sites and I can't figure how to change this. So the instructions are not as specific as would be helpful	1
B000KUMOXQ:usb_data_cable_for_lg_vx-8300:zencity	I ordered this cable (two of them actually) to use on the LG 8300.  The driver disc contains software for the 8300 only not the 5300.  Once loaded, it found the phone easily.  I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.	1

B000M4JDQQ:motor_noise:devil_dog	I really like the size and weight of the camera.  It is very easy to use and the picture quality is pretty good.  I had to return the cam because the motor noise is unacceptable.  I recorded some scenes while skiing and the whiny noise is very noticeable, even outdoors.  All the other reviewers claiming the cam records motor noise are dead on.  I will spend a bit more money and get the Sony HCR-DC96 instead	0
B000HLRAJG:better_have_a_fast_machine...:karl_ebert	The reviews of this software are a bit harsh, but pretty much true. It slow, is a resource hog, doesn't really like to share the machine with other applications. Support is bad, email transfer to move it to another system just plain doesn't work and it is really hard to make a complete backup with all of your attachments.  And - Windows Vista support is really limited.	0

B000069119:not_easy_to_use,_can't_recommend....:brian_stadtmiller_"power-user"	Overall, not terribly happy with this units user interface and design.  The spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as "SW1" SW2" etc, but they are not labeled as such on the device.  You toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just 2 letters to tell you what they are ("TR" "CH" what??) Just an unfreindly interface all around. Look for a better unit.	0
271232	Nylon magazine is amazing, with a creative touch no other magazine has. Based in the great NYC, this magazine oozes creative sophitcativeness, originality, and a sarcastic charm with amazing fashion, art, and espicially music. The photography is pure genius and the layout will just want you to flip through the magazine again and again.	1

B000HZEPJ0:not_happy:katie_j._johnson_"katie"	I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?	0
B000GW68Z8:the_hazelnut_flavor_is_awful!:marc_g._miller	I really like Splenda, but this Hazelnut flavor has a distinctly over-chemicaled taste and just doesn't have much nuttiness to it.  Perhaps the other flavors are better	0

B000BOPJ0G:fantastic_product:melanie_sharp	This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it.	1
B0007LQKN8:funny_and_functional.:new_mom_804	This thing cracks us up!  We ordered the elephant and our one year old absolutely loves it.  He can play with it, but its secure enough that he can't pull it off.  It was also an absolute necessity for us - now that he crawls around the tub during bathtime, it was only a matter of time before he knocked his head on the faucet.  It puts our minds at ease while entertaining him at the same time.	1
B000034DCJ:impossible...:crikee	I registered for this sling, and was thrilled when I received it as a shower gift. I couldn't wait to use it. When my son was about 3 weeks old, I tried to put him in it. We both instantly hated it. Its far too bulky to use with an infant, and it doesn't adjust small enough to fit my frame (I'm 5'6&quot; and FAR from skinny). I kept it, thinking that my son would eventually fit in it, and perhaps as he got bigger I'd be able to wear it. WRONG. I wish I'd brought it back when I could still return it. My son is now 11 months old and we still can't use this sling. There's no way he can sit in it securely. He hates being held but can't walk yet so I was really hoping we could use this, but it still doesn't fit me, and my 24 pound son isn't held safely in it. He can wiggle his way out in less than 3 seconds. I'm expecting again, and hoping I can find something much better than this for this baby	0

B000IN4UAK:goodbye_norton!__hello_panda!:vipermike	I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.	1

B000GE6S6A:where's_the_smell?!!:d._mike	We had the forerunner (Diaper Genie 1).  No matter what I did, it still stunk.  I would add baking soda after poopy diapers, line it with an odor protecting garbage bag as well as the normal liners.  It always smelled like poop!!  One day it broke, so we looked for a replacement.  I was a little hesitant to purchase this product because of our previous one, but we thought we would give it a try.  It's amazing.  My daughter had diareha and a day later still no stench!!!  Also, it's so easy.  No twisting.  Just put the diaper thru the trap door.  It's easy to load and change cartridges.  This is definately a great buy!!!	1
477438	I don't know what the heck is going on with your subscription service.  I bought this magazine for my nephew back on July 9th, and HE STILL HASN'T RECIEVED AN ISSUE!!!!  I am extremely disappointed with your service.  It should not take this long to get a magazine	0
0786198656:don't_bother:	Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a "catty" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the "ignorant natives" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real.  Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf	0
B000FZ4TFC:good_idea....poor_product.:r._tsai	I bought this after I read the first review below (the one who gave this 5 stars).  It just doesn't work very well...I do a better job pumicing on my own (it just takes more effort).  The motor does get extremely hot, and the batteries die very quickly.  The box says it can run for 45 minutes on two AA's, but after about 5 minutes...you can feel it slow down.	0

B000G0KQWQ:truly,_truly_a_miracle:c._pace	Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents.	1

This coffee tastes nothing like it, it doesn't even have a hint of cinnimon flavor as the package suggests.  If you want regular coffee, then this is the coffee to buy, but if you're looking for cappuccino, save your money	0
534399	Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut.  If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12.  Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised.  I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby.  It's very healthy and low in sugar.  Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	1
B000CCEVGU:not_so_great.:t._hogarth_"buy.com_boy"	Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]	0
B0002HA7FY:works_well,_wish_it_had_better_range...:s._webb	I have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the 400ft range it advertises, but it works nonetheless, and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house, I figure I ought to be grateful that it works at all. I do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections, but I suspect it's related to where I have things in the house, no so much the product. In fact, I can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up. Install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro sp2 machine. It's compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed. Can't complain, especially for the price	1

Once he was walking, he didn't use it again	1

6305972532:don't_make_this_your_first_john_woo_flick.:dxm_"paul"	This is my second favorite John Woo movie with great touches of action and drama, When I first saw this film (about 5 years ago) I wasn't used to seeing this much violence on screen (And I thought Lethal Weapon was extremely violent at that time) I was in shock and more then once my jaw dropped. This film is VERY violent But compared to other action films this is REALLY tame nowadays. The minor points of this film would be some bad acting to some worse acting in some spots, some weird cuts and editing, the subs were terrible, as the same with the audio quality and some of the camera work is bad, but this is John Woo's first (if you can count heroes shed no tears) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could have done worse MUCH worse. Yun fat chow, Ti Lung and Leslie Chung have their good moments to bad moments, most of the good moments goes to Chow and Ti while Leslie had only one or two moments. The plot is like this A cop must confront his criminal brother. That's it. If your the typical Hollywood action goer this is your perfect find. But as I said if your new to the heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one, I'll say stick with the killer and hard boiled for a few weeks then move on. But if your the Hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you can handle it move on to the other heroic bloodshed films and so on. This film is a big landmark in the action genre and a even bigger landmark to the underground action genre. I really recommend this film to any action fan!!!!	1

B0002F858C:back_up_your_data_now!:r._sriram	I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then.

I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.

B00004Y7GA:favorite_alice,_lackluster_dvd:matt_howe_"outloud98"	This is my favorite production of the ALICE books.  I love the sets, songs, and casting. It's also very British, which I think adds another great element to the mix.	0
547601	Star Wars Battlefront allows you to play as some of the best troops ever, such as the Rebel Alliance, Imperials, Republic, and CIS (Confederacy of Independent Systems). The 3-D graphics make it easier to enjoy; as well for sound and storyline. In Battlefront, you can not play as featured characters in the saga, but you get to fight alongside them in epic duels. Another disadvantage is you can't wield a lightsaber either. In  Instant Action, you get to pick any location, and any side to fight for. You also have the choice to choose clone wars and galactic civil war.	1
287853	AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable	0
B00008YSLX:great_for_two_year_olds:d._a._johnson	Every time I see my twin daughters riding these bikes around I make a promise to write a review of the product. Here I am fulfilling my promise. They were able to pedal the bike within 2 - 3 days of getting them. They are a great size for two year olds plus they fold up so that I can carry both in the back of my small car (89 chevy camaro) and are light enough that I can carry them by the big handle in the back when the girls want to run instead of bike. The only drawback is that they are a little unstable on tight turns.	1

There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon	1

B0002TVV34:well_i_can_only_speak_for_myself:shane_o._laake_"computer_nerd"	I read a few not so favorable reviews, mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand (which mine does not suffer), but I decided to order it anyway, figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand (you can also wall mount it).  Well it has paid off, as the magnets work as promised, the tines stay sealed tight, and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices.  I pitched the included spices and filled it with my own.  As for labels, there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices.  I honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack, and it has worked beautifully	1
B000I1GCVW:wizard_of_oz_dress_up_trunk:lisa_c._gattone_"shamrocks"	I think that this was a great gift and definitely worth the money. I gave this to my 3 1/2 yr old niece as a Christmas gift. She loves the Wizard of Oz. She is a big fan of dress up clothes and I also have two more nieces that roughly the same age so there was an outfit for each of them.	1

B000CRV2GC:total_scam:rocky_"triplemom"	This thing is being advertised as Dance Dance Revolution.  It is NOT DDR.  It is just a cheap knock off not worth a penny.  My daughter plays a DDR at afterschool and loves it.  She received this for Christmas, tried it once and gave up within five minutes. She said, it says fifty songs but it plays just one.  Well, the 50 "songs" all sound the same.  They are not "radio" or "stereo" quality, rather just computer generated noise.  Totally awful.  Having tried it myself, I am very disappointed and don't blame my daughter for not giving it a second glance.  Total waste of money and total false advertising.  This company should be investigated.  Believe the poor reviews and skip this product!!!!	0
B0000D1BOC:maybe_i_bought_a_'sample':jj_schwartz	I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  &quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars	0

0716723417:recreational_mathematics_at_its_finest:duwayne_anderson	Thirty five years ago my high school (Thomas Jefferson, in Federal Way, Washington) held annual competitions in mathematics.  They did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet, just was a few pages long.  There weren't many questions, perhaps a dozen or two (usually in the form of story problems), but they required deep thought and concentration (at least for me).  I still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as I took the "white book" and opened it to the first problem.  Several hours later I'd consider myself accomplished if I'd managed to completely answer more than half the questions.	1
B0009E1YKM:what_a_great_machine:carryit	ive now owned my z5 for about 2 months, and it is fun, weve already gone through a cleary water filter. our favorite thing about the machine is the frother we normally drink capucinos and oh my is this easy, and its fully programmable. i bought 2 extra milk carafes for chocolate milk and eggnog and i have solved the souring problem by adding about 25 percent ice cubes to each thermos, as the ice melts it waters down the milks which make for a better froth, dont try to use too thick a milk like eggnog it may not pull it through the siphon, water it down or add skim for a really nice froth.  i also own a manual breville which i really love for those real expensive gourmet coffees that make a single perfect shot of espresso, but i still use the frother on the jura becuase its perfect everytime.  So far the jura makes a better espresso for me then i can make manually so i have started grinding my expensive coffees with a burr grinder and having the jura make it for me. i love technology that allows me to enjoy coffee that only an expert could make in the past.  I should have given it 5 stars but we use it so much we run it out of water and although it has the largest tank in its class its still too small, if they make a wider model that has a tank on both sides, i would buy it	1

B000CDPHIK:baby_needs_to_work_hard_to_jump:yuval_cassuto_"yuval"	The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl	0
B0000AKADF:don't_waste_your_time_and_money:ying_cha	I purchased this item because of the trustworthy name and cordless feature. The positive reviews here are from first impressions. However, I have had this clipper close to a year but with probably less then 5 hours use. When I first received it, it felt very light and cheaply made. I gave it the benifit of the doubt and hoped for the best. Last time it worked, the motor slowed down to almost a halt. I keep it cleaned and oiled. The motor is just too cheap. Im not sure what the company Wahl was thinking when they made this product. They should really consider discontinueing this model because it is hurting their image. I would not even attempt to use my warranty because it's not defected parts. It's a total LEMON. It would be nice if they will let me exchange it for a different model or full refund. I would even pay the difference.	0
365734	A lot of the online reviews say that this game is only half good, but it is my favorite game to play on the Wii.  Doing tricks and stunts with a truck is just a lot of fun.  And you get bonus points for ramming your opponents.	1
6303082866:one_of_the_rare_classics:t._carter_"dr._fruitloops"	This is a great movie for airplane buffs and those who enjoy comedy.  The filming and stunts are amazing.

B000GEPASC:lacks_quality_control:c._aristy	Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.	0

Since then, I have read the books, and watched Green in his other crime series, Touching Evil.  If you like to watch films about police solving serial killer crimes, you will enjoy this.  The crimes are shocking, the denouement is interesting, and at the heart of the story is the developing relationship between Dr. Tony Hill (Green) and the police woman with whom he works these crimes	1
B000IZ99AO:loves_to_eat_paper:v._diaconu	I've had this scanner for 6 months now.  It worked OK the first month, but since then it loves to "eat" paper. It scans multiple pages at once.  For example, a 20 page document, becomes 15 pages one scanned.  I have to scan the same document multiple times (sometimes up to 12 times) until the scanner finaly scans each page. It gets to be very frustrating, actually, it's the worse piece of office equipment I ever purchased. Otherwise it works fine	0
B000B8LZC8:nothing...:scubyhoo_"scubyhoo"	I have been trying to suppress my appetite for awhile. I took TrimSpa 32 and I think that it did better than this product. I have been taking it for a week, and along with that, I have been substituting a nutrition shake for breakfast and a salad for lunch, plus working out. Dinners are healthy about 5 days out of the week.  I've noticed NO change.  I am taking these to be able to eat significantly less and still work out.  I'm very hungry before lunch and when I get home I have to take a nap and can't work out until later in the evening. I really have noticed no change at all in my appetite or my energy level, which is really unfortunate	0

190431	I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat.  This led to me shopping in health food stores/Whole Foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category.  I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any, so I went to Whole Foods near my job.  I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them.  I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors.	1

B000034DCJ:love_it_or_hate_it!!:t._heldenbrand_"formalachi"	I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it	0
B000BWO3BE:neoprene_insulated_pouch_review:paul_v._"paul"	Neoprene pouch keeps water cool, but it has a very strong displeasing smell, kind of like used motoroil, which overpowers the taste of what your drinking from the bottle. So you might want to pour your drink into a cup to enjoy it.	1
B00013K8OO:great_for_kids!:melissa_a._dabe_"meldabe"	I bought this so my 9 and 4 year olds could easily get their own cereal in the morning, and also have easy access to a healthy snack later in the day. This is a great tool for helping kids do it themselves. Some of the Honeycombs get a little crushed, but I've found that turning the handle gently back and forth a little bit gets them out without crushing them. Reese's Puffs and Cheerios also came out without any crushing. You have to put the caps on the bottom when not getting the cereal out in order to keep the cereal fresh. Maybe this was in the directions, but I missed it and learned the hard way. But the kids figured out the caps easily and it's not a big deal for them	1
B000EMSKYC:this_center_is_great!:s._agostinelli	I bought this mostly for the container.  I had individual play-doh products, like the barber set that came in it's own box.  I'm able to put ALL play-doh things into this container and everything is in one spot.  No more boxes and sorting.  I even still have space for more things like different colors and everything.  My daughter loves the variety of the toys and I love the convenience.  I'm going to buy it for presents for other families I know!	1
B0000DK5LW:painful_hair_puller:john_p_watters_"rip"	I purchased this for my mother.  She states that it runs too fast and it is painful.  I tried it myself, and it hurts just like she says.  Not recommended	0
B0002F7GX2:sq50_metronome:helga_a._wilking	The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.	1

Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import	0
B000CMFLWI:better_than_potato_chips:staylor	I brought a few bags to a work day in May, and people are still asking me about them, because you can't buy them in stores around here.

They have a rounded-off pointy toe which make them very flattering, you could even dress them up. They are more cushy and comfortable than I ever remember Keds being.	1

B000077DD3:excellent_learning_program:murry_g_"murry_g"	I purchased this program about 1.5 years ago. I have been casually studying German through other programs for about 4 years. The best basic words-only is through Unforgettable Languages (very basic, but easy as heck to learn). Rosetta Stone is the best for understanding gender, verb usage and adapting to the German style of sentence structure. I absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program. It is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking.	1
B00078JT0C:simple_yet_effective:l._t._beasimer_"lb"	This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.	1

B000000YNY:one_of_bill_evans_most_beautiful_recordings!:pat_sharp	This is by far one of the most beautiful recordings made by the Bill Evans trio. This was I'm told  Bill's first all ballads record. Riverside records released it on vinyl way back in 1962.  None of the music sounds dated. considering it's 41 years old. This is the first recording Bill made with Chuck Israels taking over for the late Scott Lafaro as the bass player. This album has a very haunting and romantic feeling to it. The music is sad in tone and suggests feelings of longing and sobering reflection. One goal that Bill always strived for was to ballance intellect with passion to make intelligent and  original sounding jazz. I dont even know if jazz is the right stamp to put on this recording. To me it sounds more like European classical music. Also thank god for Bill's college music theory teacher at Southeastern University Gretchen Magee.  Because if it werent for her motivation {Evans often thought of his work as unsatisfactory and sometimes needed alot of motivation from from bandmates and peers} he might not have composed his gorgeous original composition "Very Early" {which is the last track on the CD its just breathtaking...}Being an amature pianist myself, "Very early" and "childrens play song" were the first two Evans' compositions I taught myself to play. The piece is a composition played in C major at a slow waltz tempo. He played the tune until the end of his life in 1980, but the original version on "moonbeams" might be the all around finest one.  It is given a very slow and delicate treatment, and when he restates the theme at the end you can almost feel an imagrey of leaves or snow  falling gently around you. I also really like his interpretation of "It might as well be spring". I think that Bill Evans was a beautiful person and pianist because he was never flashy and this album proves that. He didnt play anything he didnt have to. He always played just the right amount of  notes and chords. With this record it all comes together coherently to make a truly stunning musical statement. Evans once told Tony Bennet to forget everything else and just concentrate on "truth and beauty." With the album "moonbeams" fans of Evans' music and important legacy will clearly be able to hear his own truth and beauty about life glowing from this gorgeous album. Highly recommended	1
B000BN71GC:horrible:momma_j_"momma_j"	I purchased this when I was due to have my second baby.  I thought Peg Perego products were supposed to be so great - and they are always so much more expensive.  I don't mind spending the $$$ if you get better, but this is just a horrible stroller.  It doesn't turn easily at all, the wheels constantly get stuck.  There is one cup holder that is soooo small and doesn't stay upright.  There is no room for any storage: bags, pocket book, keys, phone, snack.  They trays for the kids in front are so small and narrow.  the seats are too tight and small- they are not comfortable for the children whether they are awake or asleep.  There is nothing I like about this at all, it makes going out where ever not easy at all.  For the amounnt of money theu have the nerve to charge for this, they should be ashamed.  I actually use my orignal "cheap" single stroller, instead.	0

Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.	0
0823006964:excellent_guide_to_color:drollere	quiller's guide is the most systematic color text available. it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller's personal research into how paints actually mix as colors. central  to the book is quiller's color mixing wheel for watercolors, oils and  acrylics, probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published  work (though he has a revised color wheel, available separately). he  explores the monochrome, analogous, complementary and split complementary  color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing  instructions. he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value  composition, and careful variations in color saturation, in building the  painting. an indispensible book	1
280468	I bought this camera for my sister, as an early Christmas present, thinking I would need some time to set it up for her, well in less then 30 minutes I was ready, It's a awesome camera, I was impressed, of the ease from set up to formatting the 512 SD card.

B00016Q6EM:damned_fine_salt!:mr._picky_"t_h_b"	I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn. It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other "gourmet" salts, but it is only 15 cents per ounce, not 15 dollars. Note that this salt is flaked, unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known. It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn, fries, and other similarly-textured foods MUCH better. It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book.	1

B00007AZ96:just_canceled_my_3rd_2-year_subcription:e._bonnell	I used to love Light & Tasty, then they decided to change the look and format, even though reader surveys said keep it the same.  The new look is hard to read, and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular.  There are less pictures of the finished dishes, and the pictures they do show are smaller.  They added full page ads for thier country store products, which goes against the no ad promise.  I have subscribed for years, but this new look is horrible.  Get it at the store to see if you like it first	0
B000AMPJPY:problems_abound:sffone_"sffone"	The real headache began when I attempted to "activate" the program.  I spent hours trying to activate it, to no avail.  I got messages saying that the serial number was invalid and a host of other problems.  Now, I would just like to get my money back.  I have used ScanSoft's stuff in the past and have been pleased with it, but, for whatever reason, OmniPage 15 has become, for me, an expensive nightmare.  After having spent many hours trying to activate it, I still have not succeeded.  Their support leaves a lot to be desired.  For one thing, they keep "bankers hours" so don't expect to get any help on the weekend or after hours	0

0310251109:ugh.:g._schmidl_"gschmidl"	The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying	0
043985623X:an_overlooked_gem_for__readers_ten_and_up:lily_young	Set in a German village reminiscent of Grimm's fairy tale world this book will quickly have readers under it's spell.  This tale within a tale within a tale concerns a young clockmaker,Karl, who needs to create a figure for the great clock of Glockenheim to mark the end of his apprenticeship.  Time is running out for Karl and he is fretful because has not yet made the figure. At this same time Fritz, a young storyteller is telling his latest spooky tale to the villagers.   Fritz launches in to a very mysterious tale of a prince, who it is disovered at his "death" is actually kept alive by clockworks rather than by a heart.  Also in Fritz's story is a stange man named Dr. Kalmanius.  When this highly unusual man is described by the storyteller an identical man suddenly appears. The stunned audience quickly leaves.  As the others leave this strange man  approaches Karl and presents him with the needed clock figure "springing" Fritz's tale alarmingly to life.  As always Philip Pullman creates a vibrant and engaging cast of characters who will leave an imprint on the reader's memory. The illustrations by Leonid Gore capture both the fairy tale spirit and the horror under the surface.  This is a quick but original and engaging read that will appeal to both horror and fairy tale fans.  Don't miss it	1
447866	The only disappointment was the tool came in a cardboard box rather than a suitable hard cover case for transport to and from the job.

B000KF0NNE:talent_of_the_century:john_m._thomas	What a great idea, to make a documentary of violinist Hilary Hahn traveling around the world and concertizing.  Undoubtedly at the top of her profession, Hahn never fails to amaze with her unmistakably gorgeous tone, enviable precision, and brilliant musicality.  This DVD "portrait" includes personal footage of Hahn backstage at the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as a tour at the Curtis Institute, a recording session at Abbey Road Studios, and a trip to Hong Kong.  In an age of music commercialism, Hahn is refreshingly real and self-deprecating.  Included on this DVD are excerpts from the Korngold Concerto, Mozart Sonata for Piano and Violin in G major, The Lark Ascending by Vaughan Williams, Chaconne from Partita in D minor by Bach, and the Paganini Concerto No. 1.  On the menu there is additional concerto footage, which includes the Korngold Concerto and Mozart sonata in their entirety - thank goodness, because there's nothing more aggravating than replaying excerpts.  If for nothing else, buy the DVD for these complete live recordings, because they are absolutely sublime.  The outer movements of the Korngold sound a lot like film music, which the classical music lover may or may not like, but the second movement is incredibly beautiful and highly recommended.  The Mozart sonata is also very well played, but this is nothing new as Hahn has already released a recording of this.  This DVD is important because it contains video footage of Hahn performing - the only other DVD where you can find her playing is The Last Night of the Proms, in which she plays the Mozart Concerto No. 4 in D Major and Presto from Sonata No. 1 by Bach, but the sound quality is somewhat lacking and certainly doesn't do justice to Hahn	1
B00008WMGT:a_good_purchase_-_a_review_of_the_braun_ear_thermometer:pam_t	This is the one I buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office. It is like the one I bought 5 years ago with my first baby, the one that is still humming along.	1
B0000DZG43:don't_give_up_so_easily:m._turner	This mat is great.  My advice for all you yogis that can't keep your hands from reenacting Starsky and Hutch during downdog is to be a little patient or just creative.  You have two options other than getting upset and throwing your new (expensive) mat in the back corner of your closet.  First, I recommend that you buy an organic degreaser.  Give your mat a couple of sprays (not too much), give it a scrub with a brush, hose it off, and hang it out to dry.  This should help.  Option two is to put your mat in the washer on delicate cycle with cold water and baking soda.  Don't use soap unless you really want to be embarrassed the next time you start sweating in your sun salutes.  I put my mat in the washer and haven't had any problems, but I'm not sure if Manduka would actually endorse that.  With that, and a little bit of wear and tear, you should end up with a solid mat.	1

I haven't owned another PDA or SD card so I can't give you a first-hand benchmark. But I can say that accessing the card is quick and I have not had any skips while playing my music files. The 256MB is good for the price if you wait for Amazon to drop their price in conjunction with the manufacturer's rebate	1

516034	WOW! Just received my Toro 51598 Ultra Electric Blower/Vac and all I can say is "thar she blows". This blower at high speed actually pushes me (at 150lbs) back! I borrowed a friends Husqvarna 225B Hand Held Gas Blower and the Toro Ultra litterally blows it away, not to mention no exhasut fumes or messing with gas mixture. Its quieter and lighter too. Variable speed is a very nice option when you dont want full "thar she blows". Only problem is of course its electric and you need to fool with a cord which can be somewhat annoying particularly when you got a 3 acre lot	1
B000065AE3:i_use_it_as_much_as_my_son.:karen_simmons_ayala	This is a durable and quality product. My son uses it for everything, from turning the lights on to getting on the potty. I use it to reach the pantry and get to all the permanent markers that I must hide from my 2 and a half year old. I must say that I am a hard core fan on Baby Bjorn items as they are durable, classic in design and color. This is a sturdy non-slip item It has supported me for months 120lbs (give or take 10 lbs!) We used it so much that I bought another step stool, made by playskool and I wished I had bought another BabyBjorn	1

B0000E262S:a_baby_"must-have":a._randol_"a_mom"	We got this before our little one was born. She was born a little premature and only 4 lbs. We used it in her bedside bassinet, and later in her crib. Although we had a few false alarms once she started moving around the crib, they were worth it for the peace of mind all the other hours. Baby girl is now two and we continue to use it. She's in a toddler bed now, and we can tell if she gets out of bed when she's not supposed to! This is a great device and everyone should have one. Comparible in price to other nursery monitors, you get so much more. It also has clear sound and little interference in our house	1
0307339122:unexpected_profanity:gerald_c._johnson	The book contained more profanity than I expected to read in a book by Rita Rudner.  I had expected more humor from a comedienne.  Too bad, because I really like her humor	0

532905	I was intrigued by his &quot;The End of History.&quot; I thought his  &quot;Trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my  masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. I only hope this latest book is a  disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. In the end, &quot;The Great  Disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. It has a lot of usefull data  but Fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. All his empirical data  and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion:  that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good.  Fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the  earlier era has been wiped away. That crime has sky-rocketed and that the  apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high  incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. Then he turns  around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped  because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to  rebuild social capital. He doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like  Ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. He  doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. His  generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken  into account the big picture of history. He thinks (based on his ideology  of human goodness) that things just have to get better. If he had studied  Pitirim Sorokin for a really big picture of history, he would know better.  People can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does Fukuyama but  they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to  make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. For that, I would  recommend Robert W. Fogel's &quot;The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future  of Egalitarianism.&quot; Fogel, a Nobel prize winner, has all the optimism  of Fukuyama but with the history to back it up	0

B0002TU4FA:neat_looking...and_that's_all.:j._martin	Seriously, for as good as their mixers are, their knives are really, really disappointing.  Flimsy, dull, easily bent and broken.  Within the first week of use, our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re-straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later.  The steak knives are now following suit, and the handle of the chef's knife has completely seperated from the blade.  Gah!  Don't waste your money	0

Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now	0

They are a light and delicious treat that we passed out to a fifth grade class in Speedway, IN.  The kids thoroughly enjoyed the book and were thrilled to have their very own Butterscotch Krimpets to enjoy, too.  There are two to a pack - 6 packs to a box - reasonably priced - light and delicious - no cream filling, only a light butterscotch frosting.  The awaiting treat made this a good reason to finish the book	1

334380	EQMM is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries.  Is every story exceptional, of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be.  The stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers.  I think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale.  To address, some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer, look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover.  If the publishers only produced great classic books, we would have only a handful of books each year, instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. The pages smudge, but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like People or Time or Sports Illustrated.  At the current price, you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages.  If you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of EQMM and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be	1
64342	It's speedy and space saving and inexpensive. I bought this to replace my Belkin because the Belkin needed to be plugged in. This one is powered by your computer so there's no extra power cords, which is a big plus to me.	1
B000G82HP2:super_thin!!!:mommy_of_one_"cl"	I thought this would be great for the size. The changing pad is just a very thin piece of plastic.  It provides no padding at all. The case itself is padded.  Why didn't they use the padding on the changing "pad" instead of the case? Very uncomfortable for baby. (It is basically like laying out a piece of paper.)I'd rather use those small padded things that come with most diaper bags	0
6302415993:required_viewing._._.:lp45cdwoman_"lp45cdwoman"	All bow down to the producers at Criterion, who have done an outstanding job of bringing to DVD one of the best Rock films ever made, GIMME SHELTER.  The film itself has been reviewed to death over the past thirty years, so I won't do that here.  I will, however, let 'cha know that beyond Criterion's beautiful, vibrant, remixed, remastered presentation lies a world of wonderful extras: 1) commentary by filmmakers Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin, 2) audio material from the four-hour day-after program  broadcast by KSAN on December 7, 1969, 3) three different trailers for the film, 4) trailers for other Maysles Brothers films, 5) 5.1, 2.0 stereo and DTS sound mixes, 6) outtake footage including performances of "Oh, Carol" and a nice acoustic "Prodigal Son", 7) a studio mixing session with the band for "Little Queenie", 8) an extensive stills gallery, 9) a HUGE book with much material on the film and the filming, and lots more.  GIMME SHELTER is a must-own for your video Rock library.  Thank you, Criterion	1
B0007NWM1A:as_advertised:harold_manas_"hal_manas"	I use an i-Pod mini in my car.  It is in the center console where it connects to the auxillary input.  I used to have to open the console to make changes or turn it on or off.  The air click allows me to do all of that with the remote that I leave in a tray outside the console.  It works just as it is supposed to with no problems at all.  It solved my problem and I am a very satisfied customer.	1
207772	I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1 & 2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. "Runs on Windows XP." Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work	0
B000AMPJPY:buggy_software:bob_christner	Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support	0
B0002OGWJC:good_deal:s._chow	Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.	1
B00009UT28:stabilizing_pin_broke_off_in_camera!:k._g._schneider_"librarian,_writer,_and_bookaholic"	I was completely prepared to give this tripod a five-star review. It's lightweight but sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble, and very adjustable. I used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted, like a short tripod, and it was wonderful. It's also nicely finished, and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs, it stays together and doesn't flop around while you're toting it.	0

The Cardio Boot Camp is missing which makes the prescribed program not work as the workout that you need for week 2 and 3 is missing.

It seems somewhat deceptive	0

0071379290:meh-:renard_rhine_"renard"	I've seen better high end audio books. I'm certainly not a member of the aforementioned "Scientific School of Audio System Performance Analysis", the only instruments that can accurately measure sound quality are the ones on either side of your head. I listen to what my ears tell me sounds good, and generally, tubes sound good. Which is why this book is sort of a disappointment, you'd think that out of 80 projects there'd be at least one tube phono preamp, but unfortunately there are no tube amps, just a few rants about how tubes don't produce enough power. Who uses more than a watt anyway? Even the transistor amps presented aren't much better than what you could get from Rex or Circuit City, similar schematics could probably be found on the internet for free. Go ahead and buy it if that's the sort of thing you're into, but if its tubes you want, try Morgan Jones' "Building Valve Amplifiers", it doesn't have many schematics but it covers  in great detail the layout and contruction of tube amps. Good schematics can be found on the intarnub	0

B000AD3C1Q:nice_bag....color_isn't_like_picture:skyenoir	We just got this bag today for our son.  We got the short version of this bag, but I don't see that version on Amazon anymore.  The outside is a very nice rip-stop nylon material and soft and cuddly, and the zipper is very smooth.  The inside is a little scratchy, but I am sure it will be better after a washing.  The drawstring around the hood pulls nice and tight to keep out the air.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the color.  The picture on Amazon, and on the box it came in, is turquiose.  The bag is definitely NOT turquiose!  It is a darker blue - closer to navy - color.  And the yellow is more of a mustard color, not a bright yellow, and the inside is dark gray.  But my son likes it anyhow, and of course it doesn't affect the quality of the bag.  I like the fact that the hood turns inside out, too	1
B000A3ZEM6:uncomfortable!!!!:mrs._r	I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!!

B000ERVF9E:taking_advantage_of_kids_and_parents!:brooke_livingston_"b._livingston"	This dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my 4 year old really asked Santa for. Come Christmas morning, today, I open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard. After about 3 minutes I did get it to bark then another 3 minutes later I got the tail to wag but the leg wouldn't shake for another 3 minutes. 20 minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and I did put water in it so it should have been wet. Then my daughter got mad because she couldn't get it to lick again. The dog doesn't even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box.. it just lays there. If you are buying this, be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to. I can't believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on Christmas morning... this product should have just plainly been recalled	0

Also if you want your x box and dvd player to go into one suround sound or stereo the is great cause you get to have a dvd player and a x box in one wire going into the speakers. this is also great if you dont want to spend any more money on buying another dvd player and you already have a xbox. i have my xbox upstairs with the dvd adapter, and a dvd player down stairs so if i want a change of secnery.	1

164564	This book is very readable because it is oriented to the general reader. Chapter 1 gives his short autobiography as to why he became an anthropologist, and his experiences in Kenya. A forensic pathologist is a medical doctor trained in pathology. A forensic anthropologist has a Ph.D. and studied anthropology, specializing in the human skeletal system. Chapter 3 tells about his laboratory, and the tools used for his work. Chapter 4 has many of the cases he worked on. Chapter 5 notes that most dismemberments result from the drug trade or motorcycle gangs. The Interstate Highway System provides arteries for crimes and serial killers. (p.63). Chapter 6 discusses cases of suicide. Many people kill themselves without intending to. It is important to distinguish between murder and suicide (p.86). Page 87 tells why Florida has an inordinate number of suicides. Chapter 7 explains how forensic anthropology developed in response to murders. This chapter discusses some famous cases of this relatively young science. Page 101 tells how to distinguish between bone from rock by taste! Chapter 8 says bones are not solid and unchanging, they are constantly reshaping themselves.	1

247988	This 1955 release is one of those smaller Akira Kurosawa films that is overlooked in favor of his bigger films like &quot;Rashomon&quot; and &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; but it's still worth seeing. The great Toshiro Mifune plays an industrialist in post-World War II Japan who is slowly going mad with the notion that a nuclear war is coming and tries to convince his family (and his mistresses) to flee Japan with him. Mifune's obsessive portrayal is the stuff of great tragedy especially as he vainly pleads with his greedy family to leave and Takashi Shimura, the samurai leader in &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, is also effective as a counselor who tries to help straighten the mess out.    The movie captures Japanese dread about the atom bomb, a subject Kurosawa would also treat in his masterpiece, &quot;Ikiru&quot;, very well and with the greedy family closing in on a raving patriarch, brings to mind &quot;King Lear&quot;, a tale the director would go back to many years later in &quot;Ran&quot;. This is a small film from one of the world's great directors but a very good one	1

Kim Myoung Min(Yi Soon Shin) is outstanding in this!(no wonder he won the 2005 KBS BEST ACTOR AWARD FOR IYSS)It starts from when he was a child to his adulthood and can be emotional, funny, sad, and can make you angry!! The numerous obstacles and prejudices this man had to overcome and then always bounced back with no complaint because of the love of his country is phenomenal!! He put his country above all else and Kim Myoung Min did a great job of portraying that!	1

231375	Lieven's article, &quot;In the Mirror of Europe: The Perils of American Nationalism&quot;;is succinct, cogent, and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. My experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance, whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11, war on terrorism and god, which the majority of my students now accept as truth. I have one suggestion, I think Mr. Lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. I feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch, much of the leadership of coporate America, an increasing number of Jewish and Christian denominations, much of the media-particularly AM talk radio, higher education, the military, and with another four years of the current administration, federal courts at all levels. I will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. I think the article was well-written and important, my congratulations to the author	1

It is just beautiful to look at, and a joy to use. (I never thought I could get so excited about a simple pot!) This little green pepper cooks evenly, in the oven or the stovetop, and clean up is a breeze. I've use this to make casseroles for 2-4, sides for 4-6, even soups and sauces. Jambalaya is one dish particularly well-suited for this pot -- straight from simmering on the stove to the table, it's gorgeous. I'm planning to get the tomato or pumpkin next	1
B000FLT8D4:comfortable_and_good_looking:anna_lang	I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.	1

B000696SOM:40_cups_so_far,_so_good:e._lee_"e._lee"	Some reviews make it sounds like every EC701 is defective out of the box.  So far, I've made 40 shots of espresso and 10 steamed ciders, and I've been very pleased with the product.  I've been working on improving my technique and now I think the espresso is excellent.  I prefer my homemade shots to the stuff I buy at Starbucks and most other cafes, though this could be due to delusional pride in my own amateur baristaship.  Also, I may be over-excited because I'd wanted an espresso machine for so long.  The negatives (so far) are that it looks like there are is a fair amount of ongoing maintenance cleaning of the machine, though I doubt that this is unique to this brand.  Also, as others have mentioned, the espresso spout is low, so I drink my coffee out of ceramic ramikins (although aren't low spouts authentic?).  Also, I haven't gotten the steamer working quite right and I always end up with cappuccinos (all foam) even if I'm trying to make a latte.  Hopefully I'll get better with time.  As for reliability, I've only made 40 shots, so I can't speak to the long-term quality, but so far, so good.  And heck, 40 espresso drinks at Starbucks would've cost me over $120 by now, although making it at home still isn't free -- if you use the convenient pods, it's still about 50 cents a shot, and Illy beans are expensive (right now, I'm using an unground dark-roasted Kona, which is deep and very smooth)	1
B000I9WVY6:for_jarheads:m._e_hennessy	I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead.  I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military.  For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested.  As someone else mentione.  I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't..	0

The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.	0

After calling, the only recourse I was given was to to refuse the magazine when it comes (because it is coming to me instead of my son in Atlanta), call and cancel the order and reorder.  Unfortunately, doing this, it will not reach my son in time for Christmas.  I would like to see something built into the system that gives a second chance to bill me, but send as a gift	1

B0000A1O7P:very_compact_high_chair:stephanie_q._howard	This chair is very sturdy and we keep it attached to our table as my son's only high chair.  I love how little space it takes up compared with a conventional high chair.  However, I bought this chair because by about 9 months my son would climb out of anything.  I thought a chair with nothing under his feet might give him less leverage.  Even with the shoulder straps as tight as they can go, he can wiggle out of it and stand up in the chair.  If you are looking to downsize your baby accessories and you don't have a climber - this is the chair for you, but if you have an escape artist - this chair is no better than typical high chairs	1

0670034266:budiansky_does_not_accomplish_his_goal:j._escoubas	The author tries to bring both the biography of Walsingham and a discussion of the birth of espionage together in the same book and succeeds at neither. It is a fine read if you would like a general overview of the time,  but, after reading the title and reviews, I was hoping for a detailed biography of Walsingham  or much detail on how he created the group of people who became his information gatherers.  Instead, it is a general overview of Walsingham's life with references to the work that he did. There are some interesting facts that the author brings forward that the reader might not find elsewhere , but the majority of the reading is rehashed from biographies of Elizabeth I. If you want details and a better understanding of Walsingham the man, and his life work and actions, you will need to look elsewhere	0

562168	Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles.

She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore.	1
15299	Touchstone is one of the better magazines/journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past.

In other words, they realize that Tradition is the glue that holds the Church together, and by extension, sanitizes and sanctifies culture.	1

I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now	0
43021	I have been a Smart Money subscriber for over three years. I must say that each month I look forward to receiving the new issue. It needs to be said (to those who aren't aware) that this is a publication of the Wall Street Journal. There isn't as much market news but the writing is just as good. From undervalued stock picks, to mutual fund screening and research, finding cheap bottles of good wine, car ratings, retirement planning and portfolio health - this magazine hits on many important topics for people in their working years. I find the writing to be accurate and insightful. I would still be a subscriber if the subscription was $3 per issue. That's the true value I find in it. Hands down it's the best personal finance magazine around. Head and shoulders above Money & Kiplingers	1

B000HCT5DY:packed_with_features_and_user_friendly_too:a._m._ferrell	Before purchasing this product I did the trial of Photoshop for 30 days and then the trial of this one.  Paint Shop Pro (PSP) won hands down!  While they both have similar features, the learning curve on Photoshop is ridiculous...PSP is so intuitive, you can figure out most of the features on your won, but the help feature is great...side by side help as you click through the menus and buttons.  I was impressed!  The red-eye fix is excellent and flexible, with ability to change to pet eye, different eye colors, WOW, there is just so much and all ready to use out of the box without any complicated aftermarket manuals needed.   I have restored some antique photos with very impressive results.  So far I have not had the instability issues that others cite, but my PC is heavy on the graphics capability and memory, perhaps that helps.	1

B000ENTFQI:really_great_camera:j._reiner	This digital camera is the best.  I cannot complain about any aspect of it.  It has a huge amount of modes and settings and additional features to add to pictures as you are taking them.  It's small enough to fit into your pocket and not think about it (it's smaller than a wallet).  It takes excellent pictures that come out looking great, all very high quality.  The huge screen makes it easy to view what you are looking at and has great image quality.  The videos are equally good, with great sound and good picture.  It looks better than just about any other digital camera that I have seen.  Even though I said I cannot complain, there are a few things that slightly annoy me occasionally.  The first is that it flashes twice.  Remember to tell this to people before taking their picture!  After the first flash, people tend to look away, and by the time the second flash comes and the picture is taken, the moment is lost.  This only occurs when the camera is set to "AUTO" mode.  I usually press the menu button and choose a mode.  When you do this, the flashes occur very quickly (you barely notice a gap between them).  Some of the features are very useful.  I use the "backlight" mode quite often.  It allows you to take a picture of something even if there is a bright light in the background.  My only other complaint is for those of us with large fingers, the circular button that operates pretty much every feature can be difficult to use (sometimes I push 2 buttons at once, or the complete wrong one).  But everything else that this camera can do cancels it out.  This camera has more features and better quality than many larger and more expensive cameras out there	1
502848	I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.	0

B000A3BDOO:junk....cant_trust_it!!!:miss_ray_ray	So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again.	0

B000G3JVJW:good_value,_but_deceiving_cover_on_package.:barbara_millet	The dress featured on this particular set shows a girl in a FLOWING blue and pink gown... you get the blue and pink gown, but it's not what's pictured on the box.  It sort of looks like it, but it is a flimsier, straight version of the one pictured.  Also, my daughter just turned 4.  She's on the petite side, and is around 32 lbs.  This dress JUST fits her.  Hope this info helps	0
B000H0WNY4:cut_and_fabric_is_not_flattering:k._mullen_"excellent_taste"	With a title like 'swirl skirt,' you'd expect the fabric to be able to, well, swirl.  But the fabric is stiff and not very comfortable.  Plus, the cut (of the size 12 at least) was awkward, giving my tummy a bubble that wasn't even there.   And the last thing I want is for my tummy to look bigger than it actually is.  So I don't recommed this item	0

B000I2RNEQ:handy_so_far:b._smith	So far the device has entirely lived up to expectations.  Atomic Clock feature works fine and the range and accuracy on the remote sensor seems fair enough -- there is often about a 1-2 degree difference between the sensor and main unit if set right next to each other, but this is minor for the uses we get out of it (a quick look at outside temps during the winter).	1
B000IFOOM2:didn't_work_for_us:green_mom	I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.	0
B000JWBZUS:omg:zachary_j._shoup_"jlw"	This product is ridiculous!!  Not in a bad way but ridiculous in the fact that my first time taking a serving I felt twice the energy, twice the bloodflow and three times as ready to hit the gym.	1
124836	I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.	0
352718	While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine	0

B0002DRREM:keep_on_looking,_poor_workout_dvd:customer_"consumer"	I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. I kept reading reviews and one reviewer (Evelyn from FL) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. Actually, I was thinking the same. I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). Also her "Keep on looking" and I did. I found out "Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD" here at amazon for only $14.99 (ASIN: B00091RYZY ) and "Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD" $17.99 (ASIN: B000H3YNR6 ). Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25.

B000BNS7Y2:great_gauge_at_a_great_price:p._wolman	I wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models. This gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use. My favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve. With other gauges, you have to put in air, then check the gauge, put in air, check it again. With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI.	1

77379	If you like math, I guarantee you'll like this book!

He continues into the 19th century with Riemann and Lebesque integrals, Weierstrass' pathological functions, Cantor's set theory, and winds up with Baire's category theorem.	1

B0009C9BUY:great_looking_shoes,_terrible_quality:donald_n._bernier	These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them	0

B00006LPHE:a_profoundly_disturbing,_resonant_film:grady_harp	'Torzk' ('Abandoned') is a brilliant Hungarian film written and directed by rpd Sopsits that takes us back to Hungary of 1960 when the oppressive Communist rule altered the lives of everyone, especially children.  The quality of the film is absolutely first rate from story to acting to filming to scoring.  It may be a tough film to absorb and certainly not for the easily offended, but it is a perfectly honed gem of a film that deserves wide audience exposure.	1
B0002U2V1Y:you've_gotta_use_this.:redpower	This is the first clay bar system I used, and it's still the best. You absolutely need to use this before you wax, or else you're just waxing those impurities into your finish, creating more annoying swirl marks. Doing this step before you wax is a bit more work, but it's worth it. I could live without the Mother's wax they include with the kit, as I don't use it. But I always use this before I wax my car. That glass-like feeling your paint gets is amazing	1

They arrived today and both could not be set.  That is, the pin on the side of the watch which you pull out to set the date and time would not pull out.  They were both stuck in the case so tight I broke a nail in the attempt.  And I agree with the others that the minor dials are so small they are useless.  They go back tomorrow	0
45743	This game I would recommend without reservation to anyone looking for an adventure game that is beautiful, positive, entrancing, funny, inventive, has a great soundtrack, and doesn't involve violence / carnage.  I'm 40 and was completely under the spell of the game for weeks and weeks.  My 6 year old son was equally engaged, and was able to complete about 40% of it without help, himself (he needed help with boss battles, or anything under time pressure).	1

B00005O5L7:the_horror!__the_horror!:david_baldwin	Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls"	0

B000634JP8:nice_shelf-_but.........:w._r._kyzer	This perch is a great size for a large cat or even two cats together.  It is soft and appears to be very comfortable.  However, the way it attaches is by affixing a strip of velcro to your window sill, which then mates with the matching velcro on the bottom of the shelf unit.  There are two adjustable legs that are supposed to give support as they brace against the wall.  My window ledges are not very deep and so the shelf does not sit level.  The legs are adjusted to fit as closely to the wall as possible, however, mine do not move close enough in so that the legs stay securely on the wall and therefore, do not support the shelf properly.  We have tried putting a piece of folded cardboard under the part that sits against the wall, but this hasn't worked either. So unless you have very deep window ledges, this may not work for you. We bought two of these, but plan on returning one.  On a positive note, my cats love the shelf and took to it right away.  It is a great idea, but this one needs a little better design	0

It ended up taking just as long, but the results were much better.  My hair was super straight and shiny, and it didn't get frizzy even in humid weather.  Then when I was using it for just the 4th time, it completely stopped working.  Just as other people described, the red light shut off and it cooled down, and never turned back on.

B000FEUTVG:not_the_best_choice:noeluck	I gave this to my fiance for Christmas, who loves Sudoku and video games, so I thought it would be a brilliant combination.  He was excited, but has been frustrated by how not easy it is to play.  He can't always tell where the cursor is on the board, so if he sets it down for a minute, he can't see where's he's left off.  Then when he was playing in the semi-dark while we were on a train, he couldn't see anything either (backlight would be a nice feature).  It just seems this model is not designed very intuitively: he keeps wanting to press clear to change a number, but it clears the game.  all that to say, 2 million puzzles sounds great...unless it's too frustrating to play	0

She decides to bother famed conductor Leopold Stokowski for help, but he only becomes annoyed. Instead, she finds a rich woman who promises nonchalantly to sponsor an orchestra if it existed. Patsy proceeds to gain hope and organizes the orchestra only to find that the woman has left for Europe. Patsy decides that her only choice is to berate the woman's husband and Stokowski for support, ensuing great comedy.	1

6303505252:could_have_been_better:will	Simply not enough of Amy Weber in the film. In the scenes she was in she looked lovely, but I was hoping to see more. Anyone hoping to see Weber get down and dirty will be disappointed	0
B000050993:memories:l_k_devries	My mother had a set of Franciscan Apple dinnerware as I was growing up, though I never thought too much about what I was eating off of at the time.  Later, as a wife and mother myself, I was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen.  We had just moved to Appleton, WI (16 years ago) so I decided to use an &quot;apple&quot; theme, w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes.  I was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the Franciscan dishes. Over the years I've collected innumerable apple items, but my goal is to have a set of Franciscan apple dishes of my own!  They do chip, but they last forever and retain their color beautifully	1
B00068O7QE:i'm_not_buying_this_again!:s._adams	I'm a huge fan of the majority of the Philosophy line, along with adoring the Amazing Grace scent!  I thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  Boy was I wrong!!	0

B000E5RK0Y:best_baby_socks_on_the_market!:angela_wright	As the weather has cooled for fall and winter, I needed socks for my baby. I initially bought little cotton socks found in baby stores and department stores and they just didn't hold up as well. I have also tried socks with grips on the bottom, but they were so thick my son just sweated in them. The Children's Place socks are not too thick and very durable. Also, the non-slip  feature on the bottom of the socks have been tried out on hardwood floors and were the only thing that kept my baby from slipping all over the floor when he walked. The other socks did not! I strongly recommend these socks for your child	1
B000FYZ9TI:good,_but_specifically_for_700w!:robert_lewis_"silverleaf"	Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow	1
B000JLSQLK:another_quality_hallmark_product:valeria_k._"catstamper"	I am very pleased with the new 2007 Hallmark Card Studio Deluxe.  I have owned previous versions of this product and for my needs, I am well satisfied.  I especially like the ability to use suggested greetings and clip art to enhance my rubber stamped cards and scrapbooking projects.  I have used this software to print banners and business flyers as well.  It would be nice if multiple images could be contained in a text box.  Maybe in the future there will be more enhancements to this product for easiser use.  I am pleased with the card selection, verses and graphics.  For non professionals, I believe you get more than a fair value for the price	1

I bought this "gem" less than a year ago and was not satisfied then.  Tonight, I'm trying to trim my goatee and it is ripping and pulling the hair out.  The extra cutting heads are all but worthless.  I would never recommend this P.O.S to anybody.	0

509817	Have used this lens from the deer stand while hunting, at sporting events (indoor and outdoor) and at concerts.  Fast focusing and great image stabilization (IS does use quite a bit more power, though).  Have not had one problem with it. Solid build and has a little heft to it.  It is a bit pricey, but I chaulk that up to it being about the best on the market.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a top shelf lens.	1

The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product	0

I had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call.  I wanted something simple, that wasn't an mp3 player (i have an ipod), that wasn't a professional camera (i have a nice digital cam), or a pda (i have a palm tx)... its just simple and cute.	1
B000ARKYWW:misleading.....:themasterofdisaster	Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy	0
B000AMH1EG:they_didnt_last_for_3_days:stuart_elmer	This product costs too much for being such poor quality, I can literally just pull the cord apart bare-handed without using barely any force at all. And after it's torn apart there is no hope of repairing it, no matter how much time, effort, and thought you put into it, it's impossible. I'm pretty sure that it's inability to be repaired is just a marketing ploy so you will buy another. The only good qualities these earphones have is their sound quality, and their comfort. The sound quality sounds a little better than the normal iPOD earphones and you can keep them in your ears for a very long time without your ears getting sore. But if you plan on using these while you're leading a busy, active life, I GUARANTEE that they wont last a week. I heard that these earphones are the best...I found out that they are indeed some of the worst...and sadly I found that out the hard way..	0
B0000DEW91:the_gate_for_mom's_who_don't_have_enough_hands.:v._hubbert	I love this gate one because of the height. It is high enough to even keep my three year old out of trouble.

607968	I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.	0

I found that by shaving in small circular motion  as  you move along your face you won't need williams lectric shave as I had with the other razors and it's much easier to claen! now if the just keep making replacement baldes I will be very happy for a long time	1

B00004S9GB:soviet_design_--_bulky,_heavy,_and_imprecisely_put_together:katya	This juicer is extremely heavy, made of industrial type metal parts, but it's poorly machined and assembled.  The heavy parts don't fit together well, and the juicer is wobbly and unstable, despite it's heaviness.  I am sending this back without using it once, becuase there's no way to adjust the parts, and it's too unstable to use as is.  Also, it really is almost impossible to pick up and move, due to the weight, without straining your back.  Finally, like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer, I find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant, and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places.  It seem like the kind of company where to get a good product, you'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one	0
B000001BE1:one_of_the_melvins_best..._(not_that_they_ever_made_a_bad_one):self_induced	this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it	1
B000F1QV1Q:poor_design_on_sounds_n'_lights_feature:holly_heil	I would have given this walker 5 stars the first couple of weeks.  The walker seemed great for the price, it was easy to maneuver and the baby loved it. Unfortunately, the design is terrible on the Sounds N'Lights feature.  It began fading out before the baby had time to become bored with it.  After much frustration trying to get "to" the battery compartment to replace it, we discovered it is not designed for replacement at all.  The internal battery is soldered in place.  Once it loses it's original charge, you are left with a dismal fading off of the sound and a potentially unhappy baby	0
B000EQ8WYG:tent_leaks!:wp_local	Tent leaks in multiple places; including door seam, back panel, and through seams on Rainfly!  This is NOT normal condensation (I promise), but leaks that resulted in two bath towels and one sleeping bag getting soaked.  The tent was set up according to instructions with Rainfly secure and failed to keep its occupants (2 adults and a three year old) dry during a rain. Made for a miserable experience.	0
558540	A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.	1

B000IBKYOI:important_upgrade_for_information_workers:steven_maimes_"salam_research"	Adobe Standard 8.0 is worth the upgrade from earlier versions. If you do research and want a better interface, design and functions then you need this new version of Adobe. It is an incredible tool for gathering, sorting, copying and formatting information. It also is faster than older versions. See details (above) on Amazon. Recommended for all information-knowledge workers	1
556024	The reason I liked this game so much was the story line. It gives you choices to whether you want go to the light side or dark side and you could enhance a variety of Jedi powers. I have played this game serveral times and each time is different. The first time I went through this game I relied a lot on my swordsmanship with my lightsaber. The second time I played this game I relied more on my Jedi powers. Either way you play it I developed a different set of moves. It was awesome! Also I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN PLAY A WOMAN!! In every other Star Wars Game (except this sequel)you have to play a man and it gets a little irritating when you like adventure games just as much as any guy. I give the story line and the capabilities of the Jedi FIVE STARS	1
347421	I am a gamer and i know a good controller when i feel it. This is a horrible controller. I mean it works well for maybe like a week or two, in that time you love it...but after a month its breaks down and turns into a heap of crap thats a dread to play with. The triggers just become extremely sensitive past the point of enjoyment. I swear the triggers are sensitive to gravity. I'm just playing halo 2 and out of nowhere my finger isn't on the grenade trigger and i just threw a grenade. It can spoil a good game of halo in an instant. Occasionally it disconnects from its receiver which makes it useless until you push the connect button on the receiver. Which takes about 10 dear seconds. After the contoller started breaking down, i had just bought a normal green microsoft xbox controller and it was a breath of fresh air. This controller is [...] and don't bother picking it up.	0

B0000399WJ:dreadful_pc_propaganda:	I'm a huge Don Cheadle fan, but this film is unworthy of him. [People] who claim that it's a story about racism either don't understand the film or don't understand racism. Basically, here's the plot: The character played by Mekhi Pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store. Rather than summon help for the others, all Pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register. He is caught, and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life. That is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film, because Pfeiffer's family insists on proving that he's no animal and can take his punishment -- in this case, death -- with his head held high. Yeah, right. Guess what? He is an animal, and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters, racism wouldn't be an issue. A more compelling question: if Pfeiffer's family was so concerned with his "dignity," why didn't they teach him moral values in the first place	0

0764309706:marbles_illustrated_by_robert_block:margarita_r._mckenna	Book is totally disorganized.  Beautiful pictures, but no way of researching values.  The price list is in the back organized by lot no & auction no.  NO reference to the illustration of the marbles in the front of the book, no way to look it up.  Starts out promising, then becomes a total jumble.  Totally impossible to locate anything.  Too time consuming, and then still no resolve	0
B00000EYWO:you've_got_to_be_kidding_me.:c._romaella_"top_name_on_the_board"	Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.	0

After her bath, I just empty the tub and hang it in a knob in our bathroom until the next day. I really recommend it, it is super practical.(Please never leave your baby unattended	1

135812	"Dark Tort" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, I found things a bit leaden.  The book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.	0

B0002AT4QY:great_product!:lanaiah_"lanaiah"	I bought this for my 2 dogs & it works great & cleans up easily! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of it's large size it makes it really hard to fill it up inside your home. It doesn't fit under my kitchen sink faucet. I don't have one of those tall neck faucets or a sprayer (wish I did))otherwise it would be a snap to fill. I have to use my bathtub to fill it up and my bathtub is upstairs. The container is really heavy once it's full. My only suggestion would be to purchase a smaller one (2 gallon or 1 gallon), waterer. It would be easier to handle. I also bought the 5 gallon feeder & I LOVE it! It holds a whole 5lb. bag of food which is great! So get the larger feeder & the smaller waterer. Oh and my dogs love the gurgling sound the water makes after they drink out of it! :	1

I dont know about the rest of you, but the 80's were a blur for me. I didnt know these songs very well, which can put a major hinderance on game play. I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game, but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know.	1
B0000BVKYS:not_dishwasher_safe:kr	A drawback of Calphalon's anodized alumninum is that it cannot be cleaned in the dishwasher.  But stainless steel is dishwasher safe, and Amazon's product description claims that Calphalon's stainless steel line is dishwasher safe.  But if you check out www.calphalon.com and look at the description of their stainless line, it explicitly prohibits using dishwasher detergent.  So it is "dishwasher safe" but you can't use dishwasher detergent.	0

B000FD2O88:learn_from_my_mistake:rob_s.	I put this mount on my M-44 today, and I am not impressed.  There is side to side play due to the 1/32 or so gap between the side of the scope mount, and where the original sight seats.  Not a whole lot, but you don't need much play to have your zero [...] out after a couple of rounds.	0
B000M596U8:a_perfectly_natural_look:nancy_p.	I bought this along with the "Some Kind of Gorgeous" foundation faker.  I don't have the best skin, (oily), but like a more natural look.  These two product together are so great.  I look natural, but healthier.  And my skin stays less shiny all day.  I use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	1
62901	Have you played any of the games in the Doom series?  How about Metroid Prime? Medal of Honor? Golden Eye?  Well, then you've played Halo 2, also, because ALL First Person Shooter games are exactly the same.  I don't care how many times X-Box magazine (odd how the magazine that drools the most over an X-BOX game is the system's magazine.) calls it the greatest game of all time, I'd rather play Mario Power Tennis which was atrocious.	0

B000HE5298:great_charger:j._williams_"j_bird"	If you own a Q, you know the battery life with the standard battery is horrible.  This charger also has a slot for a 2nd battery, which is great. So I can charge my phone with the standard battery, and have the extended one Verizon sells in the back slot. Never having to worry about battery life again. Also, it makes a wonderful stand for the phone, and when hooked to the USB cable, you get data conectivity too.  Only downside, it won't charge the extended battery until the phone is fully charged.	1
B000652LU6:works_great,_but_very_flimsy:edward_b._diederich	I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next	0
70331	I bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun.  I tried installing it on my Dell laptop and no dice.  It would not run.  I tried installing it on my Dell desktop computer and again, it would not run.  When I went to the knowledge base, technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card, the game will not work on your system.  In short, if you have an "over the counter" system, you cannot run this game on your computer.  I find this ridiculous and disappointing.  I would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play.  Especially since these little facts are not listed on the box	0

B0006FVCWY:$22_dollars_for_afriggin_candle!:govagabndgrl_"dodovagabndr"	After reading the great reviews of the votivo candles I decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.When I received the candle I smelled sweet spice coming from it even before I opened the packaging.Readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice I hopefully lit the candle.After about an hour of the candle being lit I came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.Dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way I didn't get jacked on this purchase I lit it again-this time for 3 hours.There was still no smell.Compare this with the $6 'tea' candles I bought from the Gold Canyon Candle Co. which when I lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!If your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. Jipped-you bet	0
59500	There isn't a whole lot I can add to the other reviews, but I disagree when some say that this game is challenging.  I bought this game about a week ago and I've already beaten it.  No guide, no internet walkthroughs, no cheats.  Honestly, that's never been the case for me with ANY GTA game that I've played.  Heck, I'm still trying to beat San Andreas (I play straight up with no cheats or guides/helpers) and I've had that game for over a year now.   The ending is kind of cheesy too, but it's still a good game and makes for a great pacifier until the next GTA comes out.  And at $20, you can't really go wrong anyway	1

37919	Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's	0
B00068IBZW:internet_security_2005_vs_norton_antivirus_2002/3:jackthinkpad_"jackthinkpad"	I've been using Norton Antivirus 2002 with annual updates of patches forever with Norton Internet Security 2003. Now that it's time to renewal Norton Antivirus, I thought I switch to Trend Micro Internet Secuirty 2005 after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines. I like Norton 2002 but it was a memory resident hog in the TaskManager considering I was running a P3 500 laptop with 196MB on WinXP Pro, resources are valuable. Also newer Norton Antivirus version were a hit and miss.  After also reading reviews at Amazon, I took the plunge with Trend Micro. My review of this product can be best summarize along with it's relations to Norton Antivirus 2002 (updated).	1

297880	First off, I loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. It's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. Then the title, I loved that just as much. Both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the point, and revealing. Both are perfectly simple. I read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. I constantly begged for my dictionary. It's probably what gets him the press I knew before I picked this up: an intellectual snob. I guess he got that from the Oprah incident. But I also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. What's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? The attraction to Franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: He's researching facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. The best example of this is My Father's Brain in which he relates the Alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. There is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. Reading it you sympathize, you empathize and you learn. Equally as insightful are :	1

B000085RKA:cut_them_some_slack_-_new_best_friend_rocks!:pinky_the_brain_"marnie"	As both a big fan of this movie and a film student, I feel that critics have been quick to judge this film as bad trash. This film has a sexy edge to it, that many other films in the "teen film" genre dare to exhibit. New Best Friend fullfills a fantasy for those girls who secretly desire to live dangerously and party every night, without it actually becoming a reality. The house is every girl's dream, and these girls are alluring and suavely tempting. The acting is far from terrible, and it was great to see Meredith Monroe  in a more sophisticated and darker role than her role as Andie in Dawson's Creek. Dominique Swain once again puts in an A+ effort for her role as the cheeky deviant Sydney. For anyone who loved films like Tart and Cruel intentions,this is the film for you.	1

405858	It's a fun game. If you like Super Mario don't miss. It wasn't as good as previous classic games like SMB, SMB 3, or SMBW but it sure is fun. I played every level except the last one is too hard. I looked up the video on YouTube and decided that was good enough. I hate, hate, hate, when levels are too hard and you have to be a computer to pass them. The last level is the only hard one. I tried about 25 times and gave up and watched the video online. If a game is too hard I'm not going to sit there all day doing the same thing over and over again. This is a great game... except for that last frustratingly repetitious level	1

B00005V6C8:trap_doors_break_a_lot!:heather_hafer	I have owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for 25 months.  In 2005, I found glowing reports in the Wall Street Journal and most other places.  It definitely is easy to use and the refills do last quite awhile, BUT... the trapdoors have broken TWICE.  I contacted Regal Lager a year ago and they sent a free replacement.  That free replacement broke less than 6 months later.  You can't expect it to contain the smell when the trapdoors are always broken!  This week, I contacted Regal Lager again and they said a replacement is $10.  I loved this pail until the trapdoors broke.  Unfortunately, it looks like it is a common design flaw as I browse the reviews from the last year or so. I am an engineer and I don't know what to say, except I am really annoyed that the product is not more durable.  Regal Lager would do well to spend some time and money to engineer a more robust spring system, instead of relying on $10 replacement parts-especially since loyalty to diaper pails is so fickle!  Now I have to decide whether to spend $10 on another replacement, try to fix it myself, get a different pail or maybe none of the above.  At what point is enough, enough?	0
B000JD3AIW:option_transactions:w._howden	Turbo Tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions. It seems to view short sales as errors, reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold. It does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale. It does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than 12 months, but covered by disqualifying call options. Its screens for schedule D and D1 are awkward - it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions, with tags to set short term and long term tax application, from which D and D1 could be formatted for filing.	0

B000N0T3Z0:probably_the_best_drama_series_ever_made:laurence_larry_tamkin_"real_estate_broker,_owner_of_total_success_realty"	I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there.

Ever since they stopped carrying it at Rite-Aid I have been on a quest to find the perfect waterproof eyeliner to replace the 2.99 lord and berry one.  I even tried expensive brands like mac and clinique with no such luck.  This eyeliner is great for women who like to line their inner eye, it goes on smooth and dark and stays put until you wash it off	1
6303213456:ain't_spandex_great?:b._chandler_"xyzzy"	This is an HBO remake of the original 50's 50 footer. Naturally there had to be some adjustments for the new era. However it still captures the thrills and chills. You may also marvel at the spandex clothing that stretches for ever (rats.)	1
B000A7KB7U:one_side_works:p._bugaiski	I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch.  The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead.  Maybe there's a "knack" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing.	0
B0009VGQ0S:works_great!:jeffery_smith_"lude97sh"	It works great - easily sheeting off water from flat surfaces.  I ALWAYS use this prior to hand-drying my car, because it makes it 5x quicker with most of the water gone from the water blade.  I definitely recommend it	1
B00021D1FS:baby_windex!:m._young	I got this product as a gift at a baby shower and wasn't sure how I was going to use it--I was a little unclear as to exactly what it was. . .is it soap? (no) is it astringent? (no) what the heck is it?  Answer:  it's a baby Windex! I have used this going on 4 years and 2 babies.  It removes any lingering stink from diaper changes, cleans spit-up off skin and leaves a nice fresh scent, removes macaroni and cheese and chee-tos from hands and faces, not to mention kool-aid, chocolate, spaghetti sauce residue. . .you name it, Physiobebe cleans it up.  Just pump some onto a cotton pad, wipe, or napkin, and clean off your kid.  I highly recommend it	1

0671576135:sharp_edges:k._hill_"lashone"	For the first quarter of the book, I thought Eugenia was (to be polite) a witch. She slowly became likeable.

B0006MQCA4:impressive!__my_water_tastes..._clean.:ryan_jacobsen	We have some pretty nasty water from the tap, but this PUR filter system makes it taste so good.  I like that it fits in the fridge and actually holds about 10 large glasses of water at once.  The hand held ones I've used hold about 3.  I don't know how pure the water is, but it sure tastes great.	1
186062	I was hoping that Miller would turn his talents from the dark side and we would see how well he could reproduce a Classical Epic.  What we get is a blood splattered "300 Lacedaimons in the Hood".  The Spartans are presented to be a buch of Homo erotic Rastafarians.  The Persians rather than the Noble Middle Eastern Autocrats presented in their Art are drawn by Miller to resemble African American Gangstas with piercings and Skin art everywhere.  I was looking for Xerxes to have a grill and whitewalls on his chariot.	0

B000ANCV2M:realy_well_built!!:adam_richard	I have really bad luck with head sets (I dropped a vise on my last set, really)these are really well built headphones, it always seems to be the mic or the volume control that goes bad, but on this head set they are all separate so if any one goes out then you still have a good head set. They can get very loud and not crack, exceptional base, and mic is very very clear. They are light but feel solid, although I have not put them to the vise test they seem you be strong. I have very big ears that is one of the reasons I bought this head set, it is very comfortable. The only thing I don't like is that they do not block very much sound because there are holes behind the ear cups, but maybe it help keep your ears cool, maybe. I really give them 4 1/2 stars. I paid about $90 for them and I have no regrets. So if you want a head set to use is a relatively quit environment these are good but if not go for the Sony mdr-300/mdr-400 they don't have mics but good headphones.	1

B000I9WWK4:satisfying_escape_flick:peter_gerlach	I first saw the b&w original of "The Thing" in the late 50s (?), and was totally engrossed (jumped out of my seat with the rest of the audience, at one point) - so I knew generally what the plot might be. The story line and characters here were pretty much the same, dressed up in color and hi-tech research equipment. Nifty vistas of Alaska's bleak beauty, and a satisfying high-tech rendition of the half-uncovered alien saucer.	1
B000ER47QM:very_bad:	I recived a Blackberry for my birthday in the box the blackberry came in there was a plastic case I tryed to put it on but it wouldnt fit but eventuly it did I tryed to press the enter key but it was covered by the plastic. The reason I gave it a two star was at least it holds it very tight but it makes it impossable to answer a call. I suggest you get a leather on they work alot better	0

B000K6Z22U:the_best_sea_salt_i_have_ever_tasted!:caitlin_warde	I am new to the world of gourmet salts--and this jar of flakey white granules has been in great demand in my house since we received a few weeks ago!  The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also.	1
B000B6MKFG:very_disappointing!:real_mom	Looks great, but NOT worth the money.   My son begged for this toy - and it was a big dud.  Almost impossible to fly - I think once out of 50 tries were we successful.   Made out of flimsy material, it chipped and scraped right away.	0

Originally, I was going to buy Canon's adapter for my Powershot A640 not realizing it was plastic!! Plus, even with shipping, this is still cheaper (by 5 bucks) and its metal! FYI--If you don't have any filters (like I didn't) get Tiffens 3 filter set 52mm (Circular Polarizer, UV protector, and 812-warming len) a good buy for the price--I bought it because of the reviewers' comments and don't regret it	1
B00009RB0X:disappointing:s._brasher	Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary	0

B00006L7RW:an_outstanding_bookshelf_speaker_at_any_price:dvd_one-clicker	The reviewer below identifying himself as "An Electronics Fan" obviously has a deep bias against Bose.  His multiple reviews about Bose products--here and elsewhere--are transparently motivated by some animus against Bose.  Was he fired by Bose? Did a member of the Bose family reject his romantic advances?  Did a Bose executive accidentally run over his cat?  Did he drop a Bose speaker on his foot and hurt his toe? The true motivation for this guy's negative reviews would be fun to know.  In the meantime, what we do know is that he has no credibility, and his reviews (two here, others elsewhere for other Bose products; he's made maligning Bose his life's work, apparently)) should disregarded.	1
B000F3QG0U:there_are_better_sound_machines:l._meyer	We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one.  The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine.  The product seemed very flimsy as well.  We ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine	0

B00005BT1B:the_only_nursing_bra_i_still_wear!:k._english_"poodlelover"	I bought several different kinds of nursing bras before my baby was born including this one.  This is the only one I still wear.  Traditional nursing bras are uncomfortable and obvious under clothes.  I bought larger sizes of my favorite bra and wear those when I go out.  I sleep in the Medela bra and wear it around the house.  I am quite large breasted, and I find they have plenty of support.  I even do low-impact aerobics in it.  It is worth every penny	1
B0009K5UJW:righteous_bra:wild_animals	I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.	1
6300184250:fahrenheit_451_dvd:bnvcc	Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice	0

1593974841:the_most_annoying_book_in_the_series:brandon_kosmella	It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.	0
51796	This is absolutely the greatest shampoo ever! I've been abusing my hair for at least 30 years, and I have never had my hair looking and feeling as healthy as it does now. There is no better product for your hair on the market. All others are full of damaging detergents and chemicals with a dose of silicone thrown in to make you think your hair is clean, but you're killing it. I admire Jonathan for not treating us like idiots by being THE ONLY shampoo that doesn't tell you to lather, shampoo, and rinse twice, but you do need to. And you need to use no more than a dime-size amount of the Jonathan conditioner. My hair has never looked or felt so good	1
496052	The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired.  The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents.  Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to.  The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book.  You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused.  If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher	0

496001	Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans.

This 46" Sony TV is excellent with HD programs; with regular broadcasts, it is a bit muddy, but that is the fault of the signal, not the TV.  I am very pleased with the overall quality of the set.  I had the set professionally installed and set up, and I am sure glad I did: install and set up are not for amateurs like me; if anything ever happens, I will be hard pressed to reset things.  Sony's instruction manuals are not that great	1
B0009AD468:fantastic_--_pure_belgian!:e_sullivan	We received a box as a gift last week. (Can't keep our hands out of the box!) It truly tastes fresh, what a treat.

B00029TCTE:cheap:	Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it	0
B0002D152W:inadequate:disappointed	Having just paid [...] for this product, I expected the word processing component to have at least the basics.  Wrong. To me, the ability to easily format a business or legal document with "page x of y" at the bottom of the page seems pretty fundamental. Well, Works 8.5---unlike other Microsoft word processor versions or programs---does not provide that choice. Without this basic a "feature", you might as well simply use Wordpad.	0

All 3 have complained of the tires popping right off, exposing the wire that connects the 2 together.

B000CEGY04:lots_of_fun_in_the_tub:c._leone_"ava's_mommy"	I actually had put this on my daughter's wish list and then broke down and bought it myself for her because I just couldn't wait to see if she'd get it for her 1st birthday.  I always take tubbies with my daughter so I like to have fun toys in the tubby that I enjoy too.  My daughter loves her out-of-water xylophone and thinks this one is pretty neat too - I have to admit I play with it more than she does at this point.  She's only 9-1/2 months right now so I think as she gets a bit older she'll enjoy it more.  My only complaint, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, it should come with more play sheets and they are NOT waterproof.  Other than that, a fun toy.  After I got this, I did find it at Target for the same price it's listed here with no s&h charges but still don't regret getting it.	1

B0000E0JDV:sure_position_n_lock_bedrail_-_it's_a_good_product...:carson's_mom	My 3 1/2 year old son finally graduated into his "big boy bed" with our move into our first house.  That meant we needed to make sure he continued to be as safe in this bed as he was in his crib.  We opted for the Sure Position N Lock Bedrail.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars mostly because it really does Lock into its Position and stay there.  The weird thing about it, however, is that the pressure bars "POP!".  You'll get the rail in place on the bed, push down on the pressure bars so that they show 'green' to indicate they're locked... then after a while they'll go "POP!" and begin to inch their way UP into the 'red zone', meaning "unlocked".  It's weird!  It doesn't seem to get to the point where the rail is loose on his bed, but it's a loud noise that, until he was used to it, would wake him out of a dead sleep.  All in all, I DO recommend this bedrail for toddlers moving into big beds.  It's been a great source of safety and roll-out-of-bed prevention and it's given my husband and me much peace of mind at night	1

498384	I was a charter subscriber to this magazine when it started up publication.  It was a breath of fresh air in a stagnant field of almost universally wretched photography magazines.  Over the years things changed.  Columnists died or moved on.  Editorial directions were switched.  Articles that once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers.  When digital photography became dominant in the marketplace, "Outdoor Photographer" was in the vanguard, pushing every gadget and Photoshop manipulation plug-in that popped up.  The magazine became a wasteland of promises of better pictures if you just buy _____ (fill in the blank with whatever the current trend might be).  What I thought was ironic at the time was that the best photographs they printed were being done by photographers using the least sophisticated equipment.  Photographers using film (!?), a lot of large format guys, occasionally some black and white and stuff made with cameras just about any serious hobbist already owned.  But these portfolios began to dwindle from occasional to rare to almost non-existent.	0

I recently have come to find that not only does this coffee maker have all of the defects others have stated, but due to the "leaking" & issues w/ the filter basket overflowing, you may also notice that the water never completely drains-staying at the 2 cup line-causing MOLD & MILLDEW to grow (DESPITE proper cleaning & maintenance).  This is the reason for the "bad tasting coffee" & also the reason for my current various medical conditions...  I am interested in raising awareness so that other consumers avoid the health issues I am being faced with.  PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANY MR. COFFEE/SUNBEAM PRODUCTS...  THIS IS THE EXACT MODEL I OWN, BUT NEARLY EVERY MODEL, HAS THE SAME DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION & consumer complaints...  Check the Better Business Bureau & Consumer Affairs...

If ANYONE has a similar situation with ANY Mr. Coffee brand coffee makers, please contact me ASAP...

For an extra $3 or so I got this lovely turner that gets under pancakes and eggs and also teases my belgium waffles out the waffle maker for me.  Also, the turner part looks plastic, but I guess it's silicone or something because it does not melt.  Also you can wash it in the dishwasher in the hottest heat.  If washing by hand, its easily washable too!  I have both the blue and green, flashy colors so it is easily spottable in my kitchen.	1

B0007X9TK2:scooby_sports!!!!:	This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy.	1

B000056J90:great_set:mom_in_cleveland	I bought this set for use with my second child. It helps to have more bottles around when she needed to go to daycare and I needed to pump. I use the bottles and different nipples to feed her and then use the bottles from this set to pump with. She did not take to the nipples that came with this set--but they are very nice and if she had it would have been perfect. The bottle hold 6 oz so once your baby is taking more than 6 oz you would not be able to use them to feed with. Overall---I am so happy with the Medela bottles and pump!!	1

B00016S2X0:be_very_careful_with_this_sleeper:sox_fan	First, I agree with other reviewers who say that this helps their baby's sleep better.  That I cannot deny.  Our two+ week old little girl seems to love it and seems to sleep for longer stretches on it without waking.  However, the trade off in better sleep is NOT worth the risk.  I woke up last night to find that she had slipped down and her face was right between the bolsters.  She could have easily suffocated!  This is a very common complaint with this product (both here on Amazon's web site as well as on Target's web site where there are many parents who have reporting having the same scary moment that I had).  Some reviews seem say that if you have a real squirmy older baby that that is the true problem with this product.  I have to tell you that that is not quite the case.  Our little two week old is tightly swaddled at night and doesn't move a whole lot - yet she slipped down to a position where she could have suffocated.  The bolsters were very tight to her sides and so that doesn't explain things either.  If you choose to purchase this product, please be very careful with it.  I understand that those of you who have infant with reflux don't really have a choice about this but I recommend that you try it first in the daytime with your infant closely supervised so you can see if they are likely to slip down.  As for us, we may try to keep using it by elevating the bottom a little with a blanket underneath but we are absolutely getting rid of the bolsters.	0

B00006SNZN:not_good_if_you_wear_glasses:	My cheap 10X50 Rugged Exposure brand binoculars give me a better view.  The rubber eye cups did not stay folded back for use with my glasses and I couldn't get my glasses close enough to eleviate the round "binocular effect".  I did a side-by-side comparison with my cheap binocs and liked the cheap ones better - my vision is not that bad either.  Maybe with perfect vision they would work for, but I doubt it	0

69412	This book gives the reader a fascinating and personal look inside not just the foster care system, but why they are very much so needed.  Young Dave's life was very likely saved by being taken from his mother's home and placed into foster care.  But this book makes it clear, that despite this positive change in is life, it certainly didn't mean everything was "happily ever after".  Dave then struggled with issues ranging from not knowing some of the mere basics that other twelve years olds know by that age, ranging from as simple as how to take a proper bath to how to behave with proper manners.  It also gives you a good look at the struggle these hard working foster homes and parents go through.  They deal day in and day out with children coming from troubled homes, and these foster homes are in such high demand that they end up cramped to the brim.  I think many of us, myself included, are unaware of just what a struggle it is for both the foster children and the foster parents, as well as how much we need to support these people.  They are dedicating themselves to a truly needed and wonderful cause.	1

I am 59 years old and have played literally hundreds, if not thousands of video games since the 70's. This game  has it all as far as role-playing games go. One bit of advice about this game is save often save often, save often. Oh and one more thing, be sure to save often	1
B0002F6MRS:bad_quality:eric_a._porcell	I'm really dissapointed with this guitar. I just bought it and after 3 days of being tuned the bridge cracked completely. Sound was nice but for using the guitar only during 3 days, it's non acceptable. I made sure that string were not overstressed and tuned with electronic tuner having just the top 3 sets of strings (D,A,E) tuned an octave apart (The G was tuned in the same octave) to avoid stress on the guitar. But even with that, the bridge cracked. The wood on the bridge is not rosewood but a low quality wood, that was the cause of the damage	0

B0000X63JE:good,_but_slightly_over-hyped!!:christopherj_"chris"	I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include	0
B000BKUZNQ:warning:d._ramos	It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator! I'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind; I'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind.

B00005NBAV:yeah_right:hey_"moe"	Ok, so I am not a big vampire movie fan, so maybe that had something to do with the fact that I thought this movie sucked. But I am always open minded to all sorts of films, so I thought I would give this one a whirl. It started out with some potential, but within the first 20 minutes I knew it was going to be hopeless. I should have just turned the darned thing off. It was so unrealistic (ok, I know it's a vampire movie, so what did I expect) but I just didn't believe that the main character (Kerr) would have done the things he ended up doing thru out the movie. And then the girl (Izabella Miko) who had about 8 lines in the movie; that was just lame and pointless. She must have felt like such a loser telling people, yeah, I'm in this movie "The Forsaken", and I'm in it almost the entire time...but....ahhh....well just call me zombie girl. Anyways, I highly recommend a pass on this one, unless you are a complete vampire fanatic	0
B000BU4CHQ:not_worth_it!:k._sergeant_"kate"	Don't buy this stroller. The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The "restraints" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The "adult drink cup holder" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The "saddle bags" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it	0

One problem with this software is that it has an auto update function that results in "Patch Engine Error," which I've solved through versions 2, 3 and 4. Another problem is with Quicken's servers, resulting in CC-501, CC-502 and CC-899 errors. Translation: Quicken's servers are unable to reliably update your bank account information. Today, in the time it took Pandeep to respond to one of my online chat questions, I was able to migrate a dozen accounts to MSN's free online version of Money, which updated all of my bank accounts easily.

6301967909:i_expected_to_see_ambrose_bierce_walk_onto_the_set_...:jonathan_lapin_"fletcher_rabbit"	while i recently called "ballad of cable hogue" my favorite sam peckinpah movie, this outre take on revenge is undoubtedly his best, and imho one of the best of the 1970s. for those who havent seen it, the setup is the daughter of (presumably) mexican land tycoon has been impregnated by one alfredo garcia; the angry dad offers a huge reward to whomever delivers to him the severed head of alfredo, and down on his luck bum warren oates (think a seedier version of bogart in "sierra madre") is hired by a pair of "entrepeneurs" (gig young and robert webber) to do the dirty work. the irony: alfredo is already dead in a car accident. and that is the setup for where the movie really takes off in a spin of revenge, justice, betrayals, love, &c -- all against the sight and smell of the deteriorating severed head rotting in 100 degree plus heat. oates was always an underappreciated actor, but here he gives his best performance, matched by mexican actress isela vega as his doomed girlfriend. not a movie you want to watch frequently, but it is a masterpiece.	1
B00004THDE:great_binoculars_for_looking_up_at_night:roger_g._martin_jr.	As a novice astronomer I really enjoy the sharp, steady view with these binoculars. The view is fairly steady even with the I.S. off - depending how stable you are of course. My binoculars cost more than my telescope !! And my telescope is a decent one too. But I think they are worth it. You see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see - by far. They are of course great during the day too. Their weight is not much of an issue for me, although each person is different depending on their viewing habits. I think a hard carry case would have been the best but it's not a big deal for my use. I recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance	1

472560	It doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons "not" to read this book, actually read "this" book. There is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. And quite honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in "conjuction" with medical care. Does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely be healed? No where. So in my opinion, one has to have a "sound" mind, and not view the book as a "cure all" for all the ills in life, but rather a positive way to "enhance" your life. It is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. But according to what I gather from the book, you CAN use positive affirmations, and "believe" that you are getting well, to help keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. Studies aside from this book have PROVEN that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering patients, along with their medical care. Your review did not address any of those people that read this book, because the two examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood, too? Anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing their medical problem. Can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? I imagine it can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. Anyway, you might want to actually read the book, instead of making comments of what happened to "so and so" who didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.	1

586706	First point, thankfully this wasn't directed by good 'ole George.  The setting of the game is 4,000 years before the Star Wars: A New Hope, and a few years after the devastating Mandolorian Wars.  This a truly fun Role-Playing Game (RPG) including interesting characters- everone of them with unique histories (including yours), an almost flawless turn-based combat system, a sinister universe dominating villian, ect.  At this point, the graphics aren't the greatest, but are still nothing to scoff at.  There are some bugs with the dialogue and movies, but nothing serious.  The music, produced by the gaming-world famous Jeremy Soule is amazing and completely allows the player to become immersed with gameplay.  Basically, every action (mostly dialogue) has a good (Light Side), Neutral, and bad (Dark Side) outcome.  For some reason, the dark side way of going about things is more fullfilling....  Many movie seen force powers (lightning, force choke) as well as some powers known to Knights of the Old Republic (KOTOR) are included keeping you on your toes while playing.  *Spoiler Alert* Incredilby (it is a small universe) all of the characters you meet that become apart of your party have to do with your past self. *Over*  At two parts of your journey, once in the begining and once more a fourth of the way in, the player gets to choose the class of his/her character.  First time around, what kind of grunt of the Old Republic's are you? and second, what kind of SUPER-ALL-POWERFUL-KICK-A**-BITE-YOUR-HEAD-OFF Jedi are you?	1
B0009F5B7S:this_sling_is_a_must_have_for_us!:informed_mama_"john_3:16"	These slings have been an essential part of being parents. Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so.

Brad Renfro (Bully), Dominique Swain (Face/Off), Keram Malicki-Sanchez (tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer), Emily Bergl (The Rage: Carrie 2), Justin Long (Jeepers Creepers), James King (Bulletproof Monk) and Jordan Bridges (Mona Lisa Smile, son of Jeff Bridges) star as camp counslers who have, well a lot of problems. Peter Stormare (Eight Millimeter) is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp. Emotions, relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way. James King (former model) looks good dipping in that lake..hmm. Renfro and Swain are so wrong for each other, they should be a couple in real life. Bergl is hot to the bone. Bridges is a bastard. Long is a hoot as a nerdy/geek type of characer and Sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others. Stomare is just weird, plain weird and the kids are brats. So if you liked Heathers, because Daniel Waters wrote it, then this is the movie for yo	0
B00032AKBY:pramalat:joyce_m._gandelman	I expected Parmalat brand milk but received a different brand altogether. I also excpected this to have a long shelf life, not just a few months. I thought the product was overpriced for what I received	0
B0008IVRF6:casein:h._tolley_"h_tolley"	Casein is a great, long-lasting protein, perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey.  Casein, in general, is bland (think no fat, no salt, cottage cheese), and harder to mix than whey.  Optimum Nutrition has here a decent casein, that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein I've tried.  The price is ok, but I'd like to see it cheaper (who wouldn't?).  I mix it with whey and use it throughout the day.  I have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor	1
B0001XE070:we_loved_it...while_it_worked-_update_they_replaced_it!:jessica_hazlewood	We bought this on amazon about 5 months ago after a cheaper black & decker one had the heat element buckle after 6 months.  I thought if I upgraded a bit, I could get a bit more milege out of it- like maybe 2 years...but now with only 5 months of usage...suddenly no power.  Totally dead.  It is still under warranty so if the shipping costs to get it to a warranty center aren't too outrageous we'll try that route, other wise, looks like another waste of money.  I have to say that while it did work, we enjoyed it.  It was roomy enough to cook a few cookies or heat up leftovers as needed without heating up the whole big oven, and made great bacon in the warmer- a bonus we weren't expecting.	0
B000F3UAE8:still_good,_but_no_closed_captions/subtitles:shawn_michaels_"the_heartbreak_kid"	The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely.	1
B000FKGRXO:great_product:t._an_"vitadolce"	I love this product. In combination with diet and exercise I have lost about 5 pounds, and I wasn't heavy to begin with (all I wanted to do was tone up). Instead of taking the recommended dosage of 2 capsules twice a day, I am taking 1 twice a day. I figured I'd take it slow before I get too jittery. But it definitely curbs my appetite. I literally eat half of my usual intake. It gives me energy without making me feel like I'm wired and I haven't had any shaking hands. I only had headaches for the first 2 days I took this, but now they are completely gone. I will continue to take this even after I reach my goal weight. It's a great product.	1
124138	This is the first time that I thought a movie was not worth seeing and waited until it hit a premium movie channel. This time I will admit I made a mistake. This movie was fun to watch. It is well written and the interactions of the two main actors show a great chemistry.	1

B000KKWSJ6:best_running_shoes_ever!:tessa_d	I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)	1

B000002TX3:"go_on_and_cry"_-_tracks_are_missing!!!:soulchild'sa'comin'	I'm sure glad I did not purchase this cd.  Back in the 1980's I had very little knowledge about O'Bryan Burnnette, but now that I am 22 and appreciate old school music a whole lot more, I know they made several mistakes while releasing this compilation.  "Soul Trains A Comin" (although not a chart hit) was missing.  I would perfer the original version than the 12 inch version used for Soul Train from seasons 13-"Maria" (a lackluster lp track from his latest lp, Surrender) should have been replaced with the beautiful "Together Always" (from his proper sophmore lp, You & I).  The horrible and silly "Drivin' Force" (also from Surrender) should have been out!  "Lovelite", "You & I" and "I'm Freaky" lp versions should have been on there instead of the 45 versions because they stood out very well!!  "Is This For Real," Right From The Start," and "Love Has Found Its Way." were the other great ballads and jams that were non-singles but were gems as well.  The absense of "Soul Trains A Comin'(original)", "Together Always", and full versions of "You & I", "I'm Freaky", and "Lovelite" really knocked off 3 points from Best of O'Bryan cd and should be made into a redo!!  For those that wasted thier money on this, "go on and cry" because Right Stuff Records done ripped y'all off!!  This underated talented artist (good singer, writer, producer, and instrumentalist) was trying to be the next Prince and Michael Jackson but he was considered more like a 1980s version of Carl Thomas (too soulful for the mainstream).	0
B00069BVGM:dumb_dumb_dumb:s._wheeler	This is the most stupid product you can buy. It makes opening doors even easier. Maybe instead of selling this as a "door knob lock", it may be sold to be useful with people with arthritis. This doesn't even deserve one star	0
B000GEA1IG:great_dog_mattress:t._baysden_"terbay"	Well, I'm sure this is probably a novel use for this product, but we bought this for our great dane to sleep on.  He's giant and old and needed more support that the traditional dog bed, but orthopedic giant dog beds STARTED at over $200.  We got the idea to try a baby crib mattress, and ordered it.  Very soon thereafter I arrived home from work and was puzzled to find no dog blocking my way into the door waiting for a head pat; it seemed the mattress had arrived and he was simply immovable.  He loves it.	1
418462	I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth	0
384083	All I have to say is this game is not for 'EVERYONE'!! you have to be able to READ to play! Last time I checked not everyone can read. I bought this for my 13 year old son...who has autisum. He can master just about every game I get him but he can't read. So, for him this game was not much fun. I ended up playing more than he did and I didn't even enjoy it	0
252192	I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.	1
269327	If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks	0

B000001E3D:ignore_the_u.s._version:b._phelps_"bartlcsw"	Since Sunset Boulevard is one of my favorite films, I bought the London cast album long before the musical came to America.  Patti LaPone is the ultimate Broadway star, having created the role of Evita. Her soaring versions of "As If We Never Said Goodbye", and "With One Look" are unmatched. Her power and vocal range soar! All of Norma's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate Glen Close's lack of, (or nonexistent) singing ability. In fact, this DVD was unavailabe to the American market during the American run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves. Perhaps ALW didn't want the American audience to hear the masterwork of this production.  Kevin Anderson, a brilliant actor, does not have the operatic quality of Alan Cambell in the U.S. cast, but he portrayed Joe Gillis with far more guts and passion.  This is not for the lover's of Oklahoma of Showboat, but for lovers of more contemporary musicals, this one is perfect	1
310250	I made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen. I received a very good offer to subscribe, that I didn't want to turn down.

B000EHNGGY:amateurish:ian_"ian_p"	Even though Amanda is quite attractive, the camera work is bad, the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga DVD a bitter disappointment. There are few close-ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window. A bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better. If you are looking for an accidentally soft focus DVD of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost, this is for you	0
B00004ZAW4:i_gave_it_one_star_only_because_there's_no_lower_rating_...:n._m._linn	Shame on me!  I should have read the reviews before I purchased this piece of garbage.  I had the same experience as others--cumbersome to fill, trouble attaching to the window, then the whole thing crashes to the deck.  An atractive price until you find you're charged more than half the price of the item to have it shipped, not to mention the poor quality design. Couldn't give me another one of these ...	0

B00065Z4FA:not_for_long_term_use,_would_not_buy_again:jennifer_l._hudson	I should have paid more attention to the reviews...I was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn't be used as an everyday or long-term solution. We've been using the crate for LESS THAN three months and already the zipper one one end (that we use all the time) is screwed up and half the time it doesn't open. At least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out, but I'm afraid of the morning when I try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck. (We leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in. When she gets a little older, we will leave her in her crate all day.) We could still use the zippers on the top, but we don't like those since the dog can't get in and out at her leisure.	0

B000FH65DE:a_staple_scent:nikita_jolie	This one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences. It's not too spicy, not sickeningly sweet. It's not trying to do too much. Just effortless. One thing I like about this, you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. I hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. This one has restraint. Staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful, confident woman scent, I gave it 5 stars	1

B000NMZFKK:legends_of_the_dull:ellie_reasoner	More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff	0

323581	Come on America! What ever happened to trendiness. Albiet I got my Pocky from a local Walmart, but geeze! It is so good and has very few sugars for how much chocolate is on each stick.

B000I5UZ1Q:baby_and_i_like_this_swing:elviswoman	I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie.  She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds.

Additionally, you can set the swing up to go from side to side or forward and backward.	1

B000KN7DDE:overall,_an_excellant_product:k._s._murthy	It is user friendly, transparent, and more robust than Trendmicro's or CA's products, both of which slowed my computer and prevented my music websites from working.  For Windows OSes, Onecare is best in my experience.  However, I have not used OneCare's backup feature enough to make  a judgement.  The $49.99 for 3 computers may be okay, but it would be even better if Microsoft offers it for one computer at  1/3 the rate, say at $17/computer per year	1

391917	But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing.

403162	With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood.	0
B00005J75F:the_most_hate-inducing,_racist_film_ever!:frederick_baptist	A French saying goes: "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  It appears that the "historical" epic film of yesteryear is still much like that of today in that "poetic" license is taken to the extreme in passing outright lies and fabrications as truth.  One of the things that really turned my stomach watching this is D W Griffith's emphasis at least twice during the film that he did not intend to offend any race but wanted to show historical events and yet goes on to portray outright falsehoods as truth.	0
B0009VC9Y0:speed_safe_broke,_but_no_big_deal:j_"smiley"	I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.	1

B000C6SP4K:immediately_impressed!:compassghost	After ruining another pair of over-the-head headphones, I decided to check these out.  They are actually on sale at 50% off, and I've just tried mine out.  The audio is very sharp, especially with the base, though it seems to be not as loud as my old pair, I can just increase the volume to compensate.  At $35, this is a GREAT deal.  They feel great.  The band that most headphones have presses down on your head, but not too much.  It also folds down quite nicely, though it looks too brittle to be able to handle too much stress.  Haven't tried out the actual noise-cancellation feature, but if the rest of the headphone quality is consistent, then it will work just as well.  It also comes with a carrying bag that can probably also hold your MP3 player, if you so wished.  However, it easily fits into a jacket pocket.  Great, great, great design and comfort	1

B000JLLXNS:quick_clix_dc-5195_a_waste_of_money:spencer	I have one word for the Argus Quick Clix, Horrible. I bought two of these cameras to give to my daughters for Christmas. The camera lists numerous features and that is what enticed me to buy them. I was looking for an inexpensive camera for general use. This camera takes horrible pictures. All of the photos had a blue tinge to them and were fuzzy. When the flash was used it was so strong that there was nothing but white out of the subject. One very irritating feature is that the camera comes on with the flash off. There is no way to change a setting to let it come on with the flash. You have to go through a series of menus to turn it on and then it takes almost 20 seconds for the flash to get ready to use. As stated when it finally does come on and you take a picture, it is so bright that the picture is useless. I would not recommend this camera to anyone	0
B000AS81N0:no_cotton:e._boscov	I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you	0
B0000AZ101:14k_yellow_gold_three_prong_6mm_trillion_amethyst_stud_earrings_:william_e._faraone	The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	0
B0006U67G0:why_pay_more:best_buyer_"bb"	This is a fantastic product at an incredible price. I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better. It has completely eliminated my lower back pain, the chiropractor never did that. Buy this table	1
B000IB1TVU:beware_of_unbox!!!:meritaten	Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for	0
B0007MVYYC:junk!:j._baker	I bought the 2700 easy share camera and printer dock.  Money thrown away!!  The camera doesn't take quality pictures in my opinion and the printer was junk, also in my opinion. It truly is junk now as I got so frustrated with it, I threw it on the floor and smashed it.  Not kidding! When I first got it,I called Kodak and they told my son( who is knowledgeable in this stuff) how to reset the printer.  We reset it and it worked for awhile.  Then it wouldn't work any more and I did away with it.  No more Kodak for me and my son bought a different brand after he saw how mine worked	0

B0002V2ZDM:best_trouser_socks_for_plus_size_women:laura_chase_"laura_chase"	I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.	1

B000069EXR:helps_baby_sleep_through_the_night..._sizing_information:a._crawford	This product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night, especially since she can't kick off the blankets.

B000FF5DDY:solar_is_awsome,_but_flawed:brett_o._connoley_"nemrosin"	I am in the Army and because of that this watch has it's pluses and minuses.  I travel the world, so the multiple time zones is awsome.  The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchasing a solar powered watch	1
B00004R7AJ:americana_on_the_plains:m,_compulsive_reader	High-energy encapsulation of the American spirit in this tough-tender production.  Done lean and hard-scrabble, as opposed to the lush and green Hollywood version.  Curley really is as wonderful as he sings he is. Aunt Eller, the matriarch, as done by Maureen Lipman is tough, and loving.  Jimmy Johnson, the Welshman, jigs and does rope-tricks.  Shuler Hensley's Jud is repulsive, and vulnerable.  A classic.  For your permanent library.	1

0192806122:good_political_analysis_--_too_breathless...:greg_hoyt	I liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena. However, I found it weak on issues facing companies today in China or that the new business economy has created:  There was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing China in its transition.  The journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me.  I disagree with the simplistic conclusion (among others) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in China	0
B000E850G2:not_endorsed_by_the_original_design_engineer_of_the_vurtego_pro:j._sequeira_"jammer_21"	I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns.  For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I would wait for the next version that the  Vurtego people will offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.	0
160535	Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even "boring" to my friends.  So it isn't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn't the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn't the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn't care who was sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think, "wow I wonder where the story will go next".  And then it doesn't.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a "suspense" movie or as an "art" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware.	0
B00063MTXW:very_good,_but_not_quite_great:s._paterson_"miss_ney_ney"	This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!  So, now I only use it over the upper lid	1

33833	I've been a subscriber for several years now.  I was trying to decide between maxim and stuff.  I chose maxim because the info is very random and entertaining (i.e. how to do doughnuts in your car, ect.)  They do have some photos of actors and such, but many were of people from other countries and just other pretty girls you may have never heard of... I would suggest this magazine	1
B00007KUQO:probe_covers_unavailable_-_product_discontinued?:randal_a._fuller	Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links.	0
B000CR41CY:dip_them_in_chocolate_and_wow_your_friends!:j._ball	These cookies are superb all by themselves. Far superior to "that other sandwich cookie" in every way. But if you really want to tip the scale into complete decadence, melt some Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Chips in your double boiler, and dip these cookies, then remove to a rack to dry. Your friends will all think you got them at some fancy chocolate store, and beg you for more. Keep out of reach of children	1

B000089RUP:great_quality,_very_boring_game.:brian_m._davis	If one good thing can be said about Dread Pirate, it's that the physical game components reek of quality.  The cloth game board, glass jewels, metal coins, wooden dice and pewter game pieces all come together to give an overall sense of realism to the game.  It's a pity, however, that the game itself isn't nearly as exciting as the pieces.	0
B00005YXC1:excellent_-_makes_restuarant_quality_rice!!:kevin_k	Just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket.  It is rice we have prepared numerous times in another (cheaper) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop.  The rice that came out of the Zojirushi was absolutely perfect!  As good as any I have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to China.  I was astounded.  None of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker, just perfect plump, fragrant rice.  The countertop stayed clean as well, didn't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker.  Clean up of the cooker was easy.  Top notch, excellent product.  You can't make better rice than what this thing produces	1
203279	We bought our machine 2 weeks ago. It looks wonderful, nice sturdy, with alot of different features, but we haven't been able to use it. It didn't work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with Ironman's Customer Service Department ever since. They keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up. Evertime we call their 1800 number we're on hold for at least 30 minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day. Well after 2 weeks, we've had it! We're taking it back and never buying another Ironman product again. They're nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won't get anyone out there to fix it? Nothing against the store, they've been great. Just 2 big thumbs down for the manufacturer	0
485239	This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.	0

243465	The previous review is not completely correct. The problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon.com put up for the Canon CPM-E3 Battery Magazine. It is a battery magazine for the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3 and not for the camera battery grip. I think the product itself is a great thing, it lets you switch the whole magazine with 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the Canon Compact Battery Pack CP-E3.	1

And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.	0

She requested this because she wanted have something of mine that she could sleep with it while we are apart. That is how good it is! Enjoy	1

Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange.  I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited.  I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel	0

492500	Once more the irreverent vision of Georges Bernard Shaw, carves in relief with this story about a rich girl who decides to join the Salvation Army.

B0000TIKB2:good_dress_watch.:ecricket	I got this because it was a simple design but still looked good without costing too much.

B0008EZBDO:south_of_france_in_a_bottle:bec_"bec16"	I've never smelled anything like this.  If you've ever been to the Mediterranean coast, you will be instantly transported by this scent.  It goes on strong, lasts long, and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy-citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air - but not the "Yankee Candle Ocean Water" type scent... this is the real thing, like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you!  Rejoice, all women who are tired of sugary-syrupy womens' perfume!  This is it	1
190356	I found this program simple, easy to operate. However, when creating a DVD project I used a narration for my audio.  The narration matched each picture perfectly, when I decided to burn it all of the audio was thrown off.  Do NOT count on any tech support.  They offer an online chat with tech support but do not respond or are not online at all.  You have the option of forking over $35 PER INCIDENT in order to get a real live person on the phone- but it still does not guarantee it will help.  And now, I'm not even able to burn it!!!! I hate this program	0
66798	This is not the kind of magazine you read, at least not cover to cover.  This is for serious shopping, or shopping ideas.  Feel a whole in your wardrobe? Lucky can tell you what to put in it for a variety of price ranges.  That is one of the reasons I really like this magazine it shows different price ranges of a style so you can decide how much you want to spend on the perfect look.  It also gives great website types, which is very helpful when your stuck out in the middle of the continent.  The "everyday girl" advice on mixing and maxing is often lacking, but the magazine makes up for it with pages of clothing, shoes, etc.  Devoted to shopping, pick this up	1

467088	At first, I found this book to be difficult to digest because it appeared to be heading in a direction that was in sacrilegious conflict with my beliefs as a Christian and a catechist in the Catholic Church. Yet a part of me was also highly fascinated and captivated by the story, especially since I work as a mental health professional. As I keep reading, I discovered that it wasn't sacrilegious at all but rather a story of general faith and hope, of the extent a mother would go through to protect her child, and of the intrusive nature of the media. I particularly liked the strength Mariah showed during this conflict, despite her past history of nervous breakdown. And I like the way the character of Ian evolved from a sleazy teleaetheist to a caring and more moral man. The secondary characters were all wonderful, in particular Mariah's mother and the lawyers on both side. I thought the trial was once of the most interesting parts of the story.	1

B00021D252:informercials....too_good_to_be_true!:j._huynh_"youngjeezy"	I've ordered this product a month ago.  I had mild acne, I've used a lot of Benzoyl Peroxide products etc persagel, Clearasil, etc.  One day I saw a commerical for this Murad product, which looked too good to be true.  I've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had "real people" saying the product worked.  I did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  Less than a week, my face broke out even more, I had some cystic acne which I never had before.  It was astonishing, but the company said there was a "purging" state, which I held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again I started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  I am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  It's been 1 month and 3 weeks and I am so disappointed.  I've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and I've cancelled any future products from this company.  DON'T RECOMMEND IT	0

B000J45DOU:highly_recommended_for_pregnant_&_pumping/nursing_mums:a._chaib_"not_your_mainstream_mom"	I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.	1
6303945317:disturbingly_super!:timbus_"timbus_emankcin"	this movie far exceeds its later edition. this edition is disturbing, but excellent. the violence, the gore, everything is heart-pounding	1
522205	Thank heaven for Larry David and Curb Your Enthusiam, or there would be nothing brilliantly entertaining and provocative to watch that wasn't political, except South Park & Reno 911, which are really in a different league altogether	1
B0002VAZ9I:good_soap_for_the_price:rothchilds	a very decent soap for the price and qty delivered.  I have used soaps where the suds will last longer and form with less water, so I give it a 4 rating.  To be fair, any better soap will cost the same amount and will give you about 1/4 the amount, so I can live with re-sudsin	1
B000G1785S:don't_waste_your_money!:d.h.	Sure it has many pretty lights and a slick design. One problem though: it is terrible at SHAVING! I was using my old Braun 6520, and was quite happy with it. Then I saw a good deal for this "new, redesigned, superb, self-cleaning" shaver and decided to upgrade. Bad idea! After shaving with it, it looks like I have a day-old stubble. No matter how much I twist and press it, the "new super system of blades designed by no one other than Gillette" does a bad job.  This morning I actually pulled my old 6520 out, shaved off as much as I could with this "360 Complete" garbage, and then used 6520 to see how much "clean up" it would do. The difference was both very visible and substantial! I am really sorry I bought this and feel duped by their marketing... Don't make the same mistake as me. Buy something else and save your money	0
B0006MXPV8:nice_invention:mark_bernhardt	This griddle is very useful, especially if you bring your grill to the camp site.  The surface cooks evenly and if sufficiently heated does a good job.	1

366206	This memory card reader worked like a charm for me.  We've used both SD and Sony memory sticks in it with absolutely no problems	1
B000BTPTGU:what_a_great_swaddle_item:jw_"jw"	This is an amazing product. I bought one of these along with another swaddle product that did not have the sleepsack feature. believe me, there is no comparison. not only is the Halo product made better, and is more durable and holds the baby better, but it is a 2 in 1 so that you can use it as a sleepsack by itself too. I trust this company because the product is recommended by the SIDS society. I don't have to worry that my baby is going to wriggle out of the swaddle, because he is so secure in it.	1
B0000UNP9S:acuvibe_massager:rita	this is a wonderfull massager, i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one. for $50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself. the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though. so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right	1

592421	The editor's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid Lifestyle magazine, which you'll enjoy only if you're like her -- rich, creepily entitled, self-absorbed, and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining, but not really food or actual cooking itself.	0
B000C7LXOI:uhhh...:linda_williams_"airsoft_ace"	Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G&P,G&G,Ect...	1
B000KNCKP0:poor_quality:episcomdiv_"bbfk2000"	My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace.  Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item.  As they say, "you get what you pay for!	0
149300	First off, I subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years, and enjoyed it. But the "main guy" Robert Kennedy, is someone who offends me both personally and politically. He assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny. For his information, some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well, and are still heavy-set. His comments on heavy-set people are offensive, thoughtless, and sometimes even downright cruel. Nonetheless, the pictures/articles were inspiring to me, and it is a decent fitness magazine	0
536374	I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW	0

B0000TJHQY:especially_delicious_basil_for_winter:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	Dean & Deluca's Basil can add delicious aromas to your crockpot cooking adventures. It is also perfect to add to a pot of steaming vegetables or to sprinkle on fish wrapped in puff pastry. The minute you open a tin of the Dean & Deluca Basil, you can sense the high-quality of the product and the aroma swirls into the air making you eager to try many of their herb and spice products.	1
B000B6CSIU:not_so_nice:lp	The earrings looked so pretty in the picture.  In real life, they look cheap.  They look like plastic, not like crystal.  Very disappointed.	0
B00004D2Y3:good_movie,_bad_dvd:w._j._bumbarger	Just a warning to everyone that buys this version of the DVD, it's fullscreen and doesn't have any special features.  Now if you've seen the scenes that weren't included in the extended VHS, but were for some reason on the cable version, you'd see that they were among some of the funniest in the movie.  I'd really like to see this one get maybe a double DVD release with When Nature Calls, souped up and some of those great missing scenes including Ace singing onstage with Cannibal Corpse (funniest scene in the whole movie I thought), Ace conversing with a few drunks in Ray Finkle's hometown and some others.	0
B00005BYL1:not_pleased:sam-i-am	I bought this as a gift for my 81 year old mother, who is impossible to please.  She needed a new card shuffler, as she wasn't pleased with her plastic, battery operated one.  I must admit, I thoroughly expected to have to return it, since I knew she wouldn't be pleased with it.  As it turns out, I did have to return it, but here's the surprise.  I was very disappointed in its performance too!  We could not get it to shuffle cards, whether they be from a new deck, or an old, worn out, dog eared deck.  Moral of this story -- please don't buy this item, whether you're difficult to please or not	0
B00004YUGL:rosetta_stone_spanish:j._johnson_"j_johnson"	My husband is using the Rosetta Stone Spanish program and loves it	1
249918	As you can see by other reviews above, the Studio series has a history of being buggy.  You also hear a lot of people saying "This package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other 'powerful enough to be worth owning' packages -- if only it were more stable!"	1
B000B63RJE:run_away!:kurt_j._daghita_"code_over_load"	This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.  The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using).  I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews).  I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER	0
B000BFNOT8:great_addition_to_another_less_than_perfect_garmin:r._benitez	Garmin has great ideas that suffer from the company they belong to.  This option is a great thing to add to your 305 if you spin indoors or want to increase the accuracy of the GPS.  NOW if only the software was smart about how and when to use the Sensor ...	1
472427	I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie	0

B000700JAO:practical_protection_for_an_accu-gage:victor_h._agresti_"remodeling-guy"	Since auto tire-guages have the potential to be bumped/dropped/etc., this protective boot is clearly worth two bucks.  It slips on snuggly and doesn't block meter readings or hinder gauge use in any way.  If you own an Accu-Gage, you should get one of these	1
211656	Like the other reviews, I find this game a rip-off of Caesare III. (I didn't know there was a IV! Must look into that.) While the graphics are admirable, the gameplay wasn't challenging at all. It didn't take me any time at all to win, and I'm one of the worst game players ever. OTOH, it's a good afternoon waster if all you want to do is build and perfect your city in open play with no goals. Don't buy it now. Wait until it's cheap, like $9.95 or something.	0
545060	This is the candy our two boys ask for the most. And their friends (and their parents) love them, too.  We gave them out for Halloween and had rave reviews back from neighbors. It's great to be able to give out candy to trick or treaters and to guests that we know won't hurt anyone (no peanuts, no corn, no artificial anything). Just great taste!  Rock on, Yummy Earth.	1

B0001CXS4W:health_enhancing_with_a_clean_refreshing_taste!:snowbrocade	This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.	1
B0000AKADC:bad_product:garfield_burley	I used it one time, placed it on the charger and it never worked again.  Now I face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair.	0
B00063RWTS:love_our_lodge:andi_"andi"	We love to cook and we have all the expensive stuff - we love nothing more than our cast iron and Lodge makes great ones at decent prices.	1
B0002IC8J6:i_can_see_why_the_price_dropped!:absolutely_love_cooking	I had one of the originals...with the vaneer look.  --Ugly yes, but it was actually very sturdy & well made.  Unfortunately, it got lost in a move.	0
12286	This movie was so horrible I don't know where to start. Maybe I could start with the fact the actors were so horrible it was as if the director picked them randomly off the street. Or maybe he just casted his own family...at any rate they were untrained and stale. Secondly, I had a serious issue with this movie not following basic christian principles. If Tyler Perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays, why wouldn't this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...If you're trying to actually sale to a christian audience. Furthermore, I thought the bible said a little something against divorce; like it wasn't permitted unless your spouse commits adultery/fornication. This movie seems to say it's okay to go against the word of God if you're in love. In fact, christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist! I laugh as I think of the scene where Ce-Ce Peniston's character says seductively, "I'm looking for a man with his mind on Jesus" Yet she's dressed like a hooker. Speaking of clothing, why did Ce-Ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene. They go on a date and she's dressed one way, by the time they come home she has on something different; with no logical explanation. And please explain why they had someone's grandfather playing the role of Rico Suave. Maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman's dream. I felt more like telling him about AARP than I did falling in love with him. In addition, the soundtrack, IT-WAS-JUST-ANNOYING. At some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music. I just wanted the maddness to stop! Lastly, It seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate (although some are) However, having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just, well, almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large. Overall, this movie made me want to puke. PASTOR Larry "Flash" Jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity	0
B0002JTUT6:woodland_camo_vintage_paratrooper_fatigues:wendy_eckert	The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product	1
495699	This cord has clip-in sockets.I have been so happy and satisfy with. It can be use any anything to use with. I have the insulator and it's perfect fits under the insulator. I turn it on every night which I have 15 windows. When Christmas comes I will use for other purpose. I'm  a 100% satisify customer !!	1
544991	Beautiful voice, but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd.  I was offended just reading every name on this cd...It is really a shame, what  pretty "vulgar" voice.  If this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears.  You should be ashamed of yourself as an artist, as you have such power, but it is spent on prepetuating hate.  Nina Simone was a angry artist also, but not once did she offend me (caucasian male) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america.  The first song I ever heard of hers "Mississippi Goddam" made me cry, so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice.  There will always be a "racist america" because people are selfish, but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist.  I liked the cd until I heard the lyrics, one less sale adds up after awhile	0

B000225ZZG:too_much_patchouli,_not_enough_cinnamon:ilex_q._"songstress,_piano_technician,_and_espresso_junkie_extraordinairre"	i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume!	0
103951	I love this film, beautifully simple and human. The characters are real; flawed yet somehow you find sympathy for them- just like your own family. I've rented at least fifteen times, and I never get bored of it. It's great any time of year, but fantastic for the holidays	1
517288	These are great! You start out with a clean car, and every week or so you dust it, and wipe it down with one of these, even use the same wipe to wipeoff the brake dust off wheels and pipes. The above reviewer is right about the glass, but I always do that separate anyway. I drive a black muscle car and everybody thinks I spend hours on the car. The only problem.....I can't find 'em anymore	1
B000BFO7M6:the_bottle_is_nice._the_perfume,_not_so_great.:libby_b	I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion's fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn't get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds	0
0425213978:disappointing,_waste_of_time:s._rowland	One tiresome, heavy-handed simile after another; agonizing, descriptive detail that unnecessarily prolongs action; simplistic, trite phrasing and dialogue -- characters constantly express vague but contradictory emotions in the same sentence, an obvious effort by the author to provoke interest or conflict which falls flat; routine characterization; a sentence or two slipped in during a scene or an unexpected circumstance placed at the end of a chapter meant to build plot and suspense read as forced and predictable; proofreading errors; fragmented, poor sentence structure -- this book is amateurish writing all the way around.  I cannot fathom the reasoning for the quality of the professional reviews which this work received.  I cannot understand the lack of proper editing.  I am an avid reader and approached this book with much enthusiasm, so imagine my disappointment when I was ready to put the book down a couple of pages into the Prologue!  In fairness to the author (and with a hopeful attitude), I forced myself through the first 70 or so pages, however with each turning page I found myself reading along just for sport, my mind constantly drifting and more and more incredulous (and annoyed) with this juvenile effort. What could have been a fascinating read due to the intriguing premise is instead a colossal waste of time.	0

B000CBCWSK:it's_a_free_country:k._freudenberg_"freud"	I am a BR5-49 aficionado from the early days at Robert's when the band played for tips and usually played requests until 2am with little or no breaks.  Admittedly, I long for those days as much as I long for stirrups in Major League Baseball.  So I'm nostalgic, "IT'S A FREE COUNTRY."  It is also legal for a band to evolve and morph in any which way it feels.  Yet, whenever I read a review in some fishwrap publication that states that a band has "matured," I can do nothing but cringe.  Here's the flowchart:  Band starts out - Band plays hard - Band gets cult following - Band gets reputation - Band strikes out on road - Band gets contract - Band gets a little more pub. - Band gets contract with bigger label - Band gets new management supplied by label - Band gets "coached" in next recording - Band changes faces along the way - Band changes label again - Band gets new direction from new label - Band fights for identity - Band produces new "mature" album - Band gets lost as cult finds new local acts beginning this process.	0
75608	These guys and this album rocks.  Just because the songs force you to move other parts of your body beside your head, doesn't 'demote' it to pop.  Props to the great use of two bass guitars.  Released amid the misery/grunge rock explosion of the early 90's, this was a great escape into rock that just simply made you feel good again. This album is highly recommended.  Kill Your Television, Grey Cell Green, Cut Up, Throwing Things, Happy, and Until You Find Out are just an awesome experience.  If you can find the Grey Cell Green single release, I highly recommend that for the track entitled 'Trust.'	1

B000KEP1RI:caution_-_new_account_does_not_mean_new_contract:r._martinez	I have a 650 with a cell number that has been with me for over 10 years. Perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price, I thought my fulfilled contract (I am on month to month now) meant I could qualify for a "new account" and keep my number. No such luck. After wasting a few hours dealing with Cingular and then someone in India on behalf of Wirefly, I had to return it. It is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price 75% lower than a loyal 13 year customer! I will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a 700 even though I would prefer the 750	0

B0009CTTVK:best_of_the_best:a._g_primack_"master_of_zen"	I am not a spring chicken, so I get introduced to anime through my daughter. Some of it is fluffy love stories or improbable characters or situations that appear from nowhere to solve the day. Full Metal is none of these. The characters are believable even when they are a talking metal suit of armor. Ed and Al are young boys. Their mother dies. They desparately want her back. They do something forbidden. They pay. And they learn what the costs are. The world is a confusing place. They navigate, sometimes on their own and sometimes with people who they meet along the way. Not everyone is who they seem at the start. Finally they confront the costs of their and other peoples violations of the rules. Through the story there is humor and growth. The story is told from their point of view. They do not give in to the tragedies that surround them and keep fighting for the truth and for each other. I highly recommend this series for young teens and old fogies (that's me). Much better than most things available for teens these days. I rank this up with Dante and Faust as literature about pacts made by people not understanding the full consequences of their actions fighting to restore the balance of their lives.	1

20915	Just lay back and listen. Brian Wilson never misses a note. His voice was one of the natural wonders of sixties pop. His composing and arranging skills are without peer and he even plays some awesome bass (the slow middle eight section on &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;)on this album. These songs are the sound of former teen idols settling into adulthood and feeling  both excited and uncertain. Recorded with a large selection of musicians and sung heartbreakingly well by the Beach Boys themselves, this is a true pop magnum opus. The best tracks are the gorgeous &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder&quot;), the title cut, and the tear inducing &quot;Caroline No&quot;. Instead of trapping you outside his pain and insecurity, Brian Wilson invites you into his world and lays his soul bare with a suite of songs that haven't aged a day since 1966. The more you listen to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;, the more it's beauty envelopes you	1

B000GWJD14:never_buy_this_one.:zhu_ying	I bought this Apple humidifier in early November. It stopped working soon at the first time I used it. I later found out that there was no water exchange unless you shake it or move it so that it might continue to work for a while and then stopped again. You have to repeat the above steps in order to keep it working. I contacted the manufacturer and got replacement. However, the new one has the same problem, and what's worse, it leaks!! I talked to the manufacturer again, but they didn't think there should be such problem and refused to do anything else. Now I have to keep this defected machine and have no idea what to do	0
B00005M06P:very_poor_quality_service_from_amazon:ivan	Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery. I called Amazon, and they sent me a replacement quickly. The thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same *not working* condition. The same problem with the battery. I was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item, as Amazon vendor don't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers. Be aware! Don't waste your time	0
446397	I bought this dvd after reading all the great reviews and I was VERY disappointed. First off, it is outdated and that is annoying with the annoying music- but the background exercisers really bug me too. Not only that, the moves are strange. She does a lot of shoulder work moving back and forth with her feet to the beat of the cheesy music. I found my neck hurt A LOT after that. The leg section would be good if there was another way to position yourself. The ab section too was so old school, I was hoping to find some new exercises.

420494	I have to give Philippa Gregory a big THANK YOU! for approaching this story from a different perspective from The Other Boleyn Girl.  It delves into the lives of those in poverty without straying far from the lavish lifestyles of English royalty and wealth.  Again I was attached to the characters and their struggles while learning much about the time period and historical events.  There were a few very alluring relationships between the narrator and the men she encounters creating a whirlwind of emotions for the reader but in the end, I was very pleased with the romantic outcome of the book.  So if you are deciding whether or not you'd like to read this after having read The Other Boleyn Girl, I greatly encourage you to do so, you won't regret it	1

B000002W65:received_the_wrong_product!:elizabeth_snyder	I ordered the DVD of Damn Yankees to watch on TV for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day I ordered it. I paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the CD of only music! I don't think I will order from Amazon again, it was my first time and probably my last.	0
0787119555:interesting,_but_not_gripping:anon_"ymous"	I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him.   I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.	0

B000CSOZME:not_the_highest_quality,_but_still_a_great_deal:timothy_t._duncan	I bought seven beans for seven dollars, and was a bit unimpressed with the aromatic quality. They didn't have that strong complex aroma right out of the bag that bourbon beans are known for. That is not to say that the inside of the bean isn't aromatic. After all, it's the guts that really count. Even though these beans don't seem to be as aromatic as other beans, this is still a KILLER DEAL!!! I recently purchased one bean from a popular brand "Spice Islands" for seven dollars. An unbelievably aromatic bean, but seven times the cost of these beans!?!?!? I think I'll just buy these and use twice as many as the higher quality beans. I'm still making away like a bandit	1
B0002S079E:grandchild_loved_it!:patricia_vines_"trish"	I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it	1

B000BI3Q20:noticeable_difference_in_days:suz	I really liked this product.  I am a late 30's woman whose skin is basically pretty good.  I have occasional mild breakouts and some blackheads, but even before I bought the Neutrogena microdermabrasion I would receive compliments on how smooth my skin is. But around age 35 I looked in the mirror and realized my skin was getting that middle-age dullness to it.  Unwilling to pay for a professional microdermabrasion, I decided to try the Neutrogena at home system.	1

B00008Z7LY:comfortable_mat:s._strickland	I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable.	1

B00008HBY8:great_for_media:a._floyd	Literally destroys cds, dvds and floppy disks.  I was surprised when it chomped its way through the floppies, metal and all and left nothing but little pieces. As far as paper is concerned, I would use an other kind of shredder such as a confetti type as this one you have to fold the paper so it doesn't always shred in small enough pieces.   If you have media to get rid of, there is no better little shredder than this.  I keep it next to my computer and it doesn't take up much room so it is very handy to use	1
448001	This is a poorly designed remote. I have six devices connected to my HD television set. The software depends on the user assigning positions to the various inputs to the TV and, in my case, routinely activated the wrong device when I used the remote.

At this point the only thing that I use the remote for is to remotely turn on my satellite receiver at a certain time during the day to record to Replay TV (which cannot turn the TV on and off).	0

400159	I love this product.  It is not super sweet like American sweets, but just right.  It tastes like drinking green tea iced tea.  Very refreshing with only one.  These Japanese foods are high on flavor and it makes it so easy to eat just a few.  I am dieting, so I like something I am not prone to over eat.  They do have hydrogenated oils so that is not good, but I hear there is something about possibly getting it out.  Another interesting ingredient was shea great for lotion and a nut butter that tastes good too I know now.  Very good refreshing after meal taste.  One is even satisfiying and I mean one stick. Not one individual pack.  They come in small packs so they are easy to take on the go.  Enjoy	1

B000E1HAIK:vec010bd_jump_starter:r._w._dean	I'm using this product to power a small electric trolling motor that I use as emergency power for my small inflatable sailboat.  For that purpose, it is performing well -- giving me the 30 minute usage per unit that I thought it would.  I would like a better indication of how much charge is left in the battery.  The three lights (low, medium, high) are OK but not as accurate an indicator as I think a meter or more lights would have been.   I like the 12V outlet to power accesories in the boat.  I do not need the DC-to-DC charging option. Charge time has been good.  Maybe this winter I'll keep a charged unit in my vehicle and actually use the unit for its intended purpose.	1

225565	It has been a long time since I read the novel upon which this book is based, but I do clearly remember it making sense.  This movie doesn't even make sense (to quote a chicken I know).  Marlon Brando somnambulizes his way through the film and, instead of coming off as sinister, menacing, and dominating, he makes Dr. Moreau into a joke.  Val Kilmer's portrayal is vacuous and silly.  Is the character supposed to be under the influence?  I guess he wanted it portrayed that way.  The script?  Is there one?  Moreau talks about having almost reached his goal.  Where?  His one "son" and his "daughter" do have some fine traits, but both are also pretty ineffectual.	0

B000K96HBC:don't_buy_it:d._garzone	This bigwheel is so poorly made.  You have to affix the pedals and they do not stay on.  We put duct tape around the rod that holds the pedals on so they would stay.  The seat back has cracked already and we've only owned it one month.  The tassles on the handles don't stay in and the wheels are completely smooth so they offer no traction.  Lastly, there is no breaking mechanism.  Anyone who remembers riding a bigwheel knows that having a break is a must if you like to "skid out"!  Keep looking.	0

I'm getting a little older now and my feet seem to get cold, plus I run outside to do quick things like grab something from my shop, turn on the water for a tree or plant, etc... things that normally require me to slip on some shoes.  These slippers are VERY soft, but have a substantial enough sole to step a few steps outside without worry.  The light color and porous surface do tend to stain easily however, but so far I've managed to wash off the toothpaste drips and such (laugh with me).  Yes I'd recommend them for now and will let you know later how they held up	1

B0000027ED:a_genius_re-imagines_genius:a_reader_and_a_writer	Brilliant, glorious music--all of it, although I agree with those who have come to feel that the Ellington/Strayhorn version of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite,&quot; in particular, is an all-too-often-buried treasure that no Christmas season should be without (and if you can ignore it for the rest of the year, you have more willpower than I).  What happens to Tchaikovsky's marvellous music--and Grieg's, too--in these hands is creative homage of the highest order: the music is re-imagined from the inside, in wholly jazz terms, in a way that simultaneously illuminates and completely reconceives the original.  What Balanchine did for Tchaikovsky and Stravinsky in dance, Ellington here does for Tchaikovsky and Grieg in another realm of music, and leaves us with works that deserve to be every bit as loved and celebrated as their older and better-known prototypes.  And to top it all off, you get Ellington and Strayhorn's own superb &quot;Suite Thursday.&quot;  Listen and rejoice	1

0393974995:truly_one_of_the_best.:	One reviewer claims that this is marred by some of Eliot's unfurtunate preducices. But how come you don't say something like that about O' Henry. We can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. Someone calls hemingway looking forward? If that's looking forward I'de rather look backward. Hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. Most of the people that reviewer named justly loved Eliot. Eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but towards what we have made out of the present. In name of progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. To call Eliot Conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous, the first draft according to one of Eliot's biographers, was absolutly a expression of Relavtism. One critic accused him being a Nihilist.	1

1569472793:tedious,_implausible,_and_wooden:richard_hussong	I forced myself to finish this book, though it was touch and go in several places, just so I could feel able to review it fairly.  It seems I liked it even less than reviewer Ms. Trieste "CF", below, but I am in general agreement with her points.  There are just so many things wrong with this book that even the grating "famous names" don't really stand out for me.  Let's see, where to begin:  the naive political ranting, the unspeakable dialogue, the corny love interest, the wholly implausible technology, the absurd coincidences, the distractingly disjointed structure, the proliferation of minor characters, the talky explanations of the detective's thought processes, the total incompetence and corruption of the police - I can't go on; it's hackneyed and poorly written, and that's all there is to it.	0
B000056HEE:scathing_view_toward_popular_religion:roger_kennedy	I think a lot of people miss the power of this movie.  To me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by Ministries in this country.  Even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous TV Ministries today, the message is still clear.  Those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie.	1

However, the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well.  In fact, two rails arrived completely broken off (opposite sides and at different levels) and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld.  I thought that the broken-off rails were parts to be used in the oven's assembly; otherwise, I would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together.  I would have returned it.	0

My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product	0

415422	I will not try to say that I asserted the painstaking, analytic effort that some would argue is necessary for an appreciation of Heidegger. More than that, I have no interest in doing so. It is largely agreed by the majority of his readers that this book deals with the question of being (existence), and my reading didn't lead me to any other conclusions. So as I said I have no interest in reading this a second time, further, deeper, or slower.	0

32435	This used to be a pretty decent music magazine.  Not the best that was out there, but still decent.  However, Rolling Stone has taken a huge nose-dive in the past ten or so years.  I'm not sure I'd even really call it a music magazine anymore.  It's more a pop-culture magazine that panders to teeny-boppers.  A music magazine's main focus should be music, but RS has over the years started including more and more articles on TV shows, movies, politics, etc and less and less on music...especially less and less on good music.  If you want a magazine on pop-culture go with Entertainment Weekly.  It, at least, has a bit of taste here and there and doesn't spout off about politics.  If I want politics, I'll read the newspaper or watch CNN.  I don't buy music magazines for politics.  I buy them for music.  If you want a good music magazine, this isn't the place to look anymore.	0

B000FBUR8O:not_easy_to_use!:j._charvat	I had great hope for this item after reading reviews, but found that it didn't function as described, and that the three buttons that control it are so close together that my fingers were unable to press them individually...and I have tiny hands.

B0000CCZUW:wonderful_gluten_free_alternative!:s._titus	I have been enjoying this mix for quite some time. It is a great gluten-free way to satisfy chocolate cravings.  Although the brownies can be a bit on the chewy side,I would highly recommend making the cookie recipe shown on the bag.  It makes really great chocolate cookies, definitely the best gluten-free ones that I have come across in a mix so far. I have even passed these off at holiday parties as regular chocolate cookies and my guests loved them.	1
0939251744:how_much_did_coke_pay_for_the_ads?:s._martin	At first glance this is a great book. However, once you've read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration. The author, illustrator, and publisher should be ashamed of themselves. We all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on TV and at the movies, but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children's books as well? This is a clever book and I was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series. The greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind, however	0
B00066LEYE:bad_investment:g._s._cummins_"gary-bike_enthusiast"	I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke.  If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one.  I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson.  Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses.  Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air.  Stay away from this, and other "pedestrian" pumps.  Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill	0
B00081MKY0:baby_universe-_use_at_your_own_risk:m_f	I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business	0
B00008614F:the_best_you_can_get_for_moms_who_nurse.:megan's_mom	I'm the mother of a 3 1/2 month old baby girl. I had intended to only breastfeed for the first year, but it turned out that my daughter had a very difficult time at first with latching on. So much so that she ended up taking in very little milk and her weight dropped nearly a whole pound from her birth weight in the first week. The pediatrician told us we would have to supplement with formula to bring her weight up. I chose the Premium Nurser bottles because they said they were good for switching between breast and bottle feeding. My daughter took well to the bottles, and even started latching on better when I did breast feed. I'm continuing to use formula along with breastfeeding with no nipple confusion problems whatsoever. When people ask me if I breastfeed or bottlefeed my baby, I say "both", and they tell me how lucky I am! These bottles are a life-saver! They're easy to clean (I use the top rack of the dishwasher), and my baby hasn't had any problems with colic. I like the convenience of the disposable bags, too. And my daughter is now starting to "help" hold on to the bottle while I feed her. These are the best	1

Women with terrible haircuts, dirty homes filled with poor taste in furniture, jobs a 16 year old would have - or no jobs at all, awkward behavior, barely able to function socially...UH+GH!  The truth is, there are gay women out there who look great, have beautiful homes, have very progressive and meaningful careers, have talent and are entertaining and sexy.  WHO SAYS this is representative??  Not in MY world it isn't.  I am so sick of these painful displays of us.  Anyone who gave it over 2 stars is childishly defending the genre in general, and not talking about this stinker of a film.	0
B000085EF9:a_charming,_clever_british_comedy:joe_sixpack_--__slipcue.com	Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	1
501874	My initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge, and full of ads.  I also read Vogue, though, and to be honest, W has less ads in it.  W convieniently avoids the snotty air of Harper's Bazaar and Vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in Cosmopolitan, Redbook, and Marie Claire, and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of InStyle.  This magazine has excellent layouts, and from what I've read thus far, excellent-and very different-stories.  As a regular Vogue reader, I'm used to reading about older designers like Coco Chanel, the Versace and Prada lines, and reading about a small smattering of socialites, like Aerin Lauder, Paris Hilton, Jemma Kidd, Victoria Traina.  What is different about W is that it profiles the new and the modern.  An article in the September issue profiled Kate Spade and her new line.  Other articles talked, almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites, meanwhile talking about, in an article aptly titled "A Bag Called It" the trend of statement purses and their proper place.  W is also similar to Vogue that in addition to the good layouts, it has even better photography, there are no Photoshopped to death photos in here, and if they are, this student can't find them.  What I like most about W is its sarcastic wit, something that is lost in most magazines, many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man, worship Teri Hatcher, or read dumbed down articles.	1
B00006B13O:can't_get_grooves_clean:emcee_"lookingforcookware"	I did not buy the whole set. My review is for an 8" fry pan. It was one of those "try it" deals. I do not like the grooves in the pan because after, for instance, frying an egg, the grooves retain food and if you don't use a brush to scrub the grooves you'll find that after it has dried there are going to be bits of food caught in the grooves.

B000A8LQA0:do_not_buy._embarrassing:david_j._toback	These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid.	0
630105573X:most_underrated_spielberg_movie:s._miller_"stm"	This is my favorite Spielberg movie. Most other directors would live off a film like this for the rest of their lives. For Spielberg, this is almost a forgotten movie. Wonderful story about a young English boy (Christian Bale) living in China who gets separated from his parents and ends up in Japanese prison camp during WWII. Filmed in China, it beautifully depicts in full detail a part of WWII that is seldom viewed.	1

I experienced the same trouble as other reviewers, packets showing up hard and useless. When purchased in the store, I have never had one hard or brittle packet. Don't bother purchasing from Amazon, instead head to your local Trader Joe's where you can purchase 100 packets for $5.99. Not the fiber supplement type, but doesn't clump and more per packet.

B0000028TU:a__rather__ordinary__if__pleasant__greatest__hits:ho_chi_minh	This CD was a Big Seller upon it's release in 1992, boasting a Plethora of Big Hits, along with some New Songs.  Looking back through 2005 Eyelids, it's hard to hear why these songs were so Huge....The CD starts off well, with Hits from the Primitive Love Album, but as One keeps listening, He realizes that None of these songs have Passion or Depth, a few catchy Melodies and Pleasant, if Plain Vocals.  The Dance Numbers at least keep You awake, but the Years 1988-92 found Estefan leaning on Ballads, and One was barely distinguishable from another; on top of that, the 4 New Cuts feel like padding, to fill a CD's worth of material for a Christmastime Release...a Couple of Hits are missing, too(i.e., Bad Boys), so to summarize, Nothing truly Bad here, but precious little on Target...	0

299536	Sure I like a mystery- who doesn't? But when you a read a magazine like Hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story. The tales are hard-edged and lacking in style and substance. We seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again Hitchcock Magazine is a disappointment. The value for money is horrible, the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge- Alfred Hitchcock would not be proud	0
216792	"The Island of Lost Maps" is the story of a petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  Posing as a researcher, Bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  Then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  Before being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.	0

B000FGXPRE:get_the_honey_nut__version_instead:athiker	I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though.	0

The plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship. The story line is totally different and therefore some of Porter's original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of Sammy Cahn and James Van Huesen which do not live up to Porter's quality.	0

However, the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don't secure them.

The latter comes on a single disk; the former on about six.  Also, note this is not the same as Microsoft Works - a suite of programs often preloaded on a new computer.

B000ITLPW0:nice_gift_basket_but_inferior_quality_control.:sml	Purchased as a gift to client. The gift basket arrived on time and the recipient commented on how nice the basket was. But one of the cups was chipped. They could not find the chipped piece so we don't know whether or not the break occurred during shipping or not. Either way better care could have been used to insure that the cups are in perfect condition upon arrival. I'm very disappointed especially since this was sent as a gift to an important client. Starbucks coffee and mugs are great corporate gifts but I would choose another company to handle the gift baskets. Will not use them again	0
B0000048YO:triangular:blockhed_"blockhed"	Like everyone says, this is a very strange story.    It seems to be a love-triangle, but there are more angles than three. For about half the film I thought Glenn Ford was meant to be in love with the Ballin Mundson (Ballin Mundson?) character, because he saved Ford's life (what for?), then gave him a job and was good to him. So far, so odd, but relatively simple to understand. When Rita shows up things become extremely complicated: incomprehensible in fact.  Who had run out on who, and why? I think we should have been told. Was it something to do with Rita's earlier line of work?  A lot of blame was being put on Rita, but so far as I could see she wasn't doing much wrong. Well, maybe just a bit of a tease, but so lovely, sweet and tender you'd forgive her anything. Actually, nobody's motivation here was the slightest bit convincing.  Also, as somebody else has said, the plot reads as if someone put together the pieces left on the cutting-room floor after Casablanca. Anyway, two-thirds into the story,  we get a totally alien sub-plot about conquering the world by cornering the tungsten filament market, which we couldn't care less about, as it has  nothing to do with the tensions between the three main players.  This part is boring and even more unconvincing than the original triangle. The sinister Mr Mundson looked good in his part, but it seemed as if he wasn't being allowed to get his teeth into the role.  Glenn Ford has never impressed me as a personality. He never seems to have what it takes: I can't imagine Rita falling for him, nor can I believe he could take out heavies with his puff-ball punches. I can't even believe he'd behave like the nasty little swine he's supposed to be. So why have I watched this movie two or three times, and why will I watch it again? Only one answer: you said it, folks --- Rita Hayworth.	1

However, most of the time, I need to shut off ZoneAlarm in order to access the internet - just like another reviewer.  Defeats the purpose don't you think?

338365	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star.	0

B000000OS7:what_do_you_call_that_noise?:roy_pearl	It's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock. Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky, spastic wit of &quot;White Music&quot;. Come to think of it, not many people could make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than &quot;pop&quot;, and Barry Andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to &quot;This Is Pop&quot;. A few songs later Dylan's &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were anywhere near as smart as &quot;White Music&quot;	1
B000F6NPOW:disapointed_buyer:a._hansen_"workout_girl"	I received the sleepwarmer blanket last week and have been very disapointed--it is just not warm enough!!  Even on the highest setting it doesn't get warm enough initially.  It is fine for keeping warm during the night but I want to be able to turn it down to keep warm and have it pretty hot in the beginning and that is not at all what this does.  It is nice and soft but you can absolutely feel the wires as well.  Not worth the money at all	0
102788	I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.	1

B00006J6WX:bad_product!:m._kaur	Okay - there's something wrong with Brita filters. They don't always fit into the pitchers - when I tilt the pitcher I can hear the filter shifting inside - and yes, I am aligning it properly. It may filter out impurities contained in the tap water, but only to replace them with thick black carbon particles. I've followed all the instructions and replace the filters every second month, but darned if there isn't a problem with every single one! Don't buy this - look for another alternative	0

B000E1336S:your_search_is_over_-_this_one_actually_smells_when_lit.:britney_jackson	know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.	1
B00006AUH9:english_humor_for_americans:still_"hitech_luddite"	English humor is famous for it's eccentricities but with the exception of selected Monty Python you need the English pedigree to really like it.

192375	I've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and I've loved getting this, but it has undergone changes recently and NOT for the better. Specifically, I hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. Whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about, now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly EVERYTHING looks the same. It looked better BEFORE. The writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?), and there are "filler" pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. The strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics, especially the movie and dvd section. Sadly, typically, when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like I'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos I don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this	0

B000056MQY:unnecessary:"coalblacksky@hotmail.com"	This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's &quot;Stronger Than Death&quot; album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of &quot;All For You&quot; and &quot;13 Years Of Grief&quot; sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of &quot;No More Tears&quot; tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. &quot;Like A Bird&quot; is the best song Neil Young never wrote and &quot;Blood In The Well&quot; shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story	0

I bought this and the batteries died.  I sent Saitek an e-mail and they sent me two new ones.  Great, they worked!  Then they died soon after.  Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues.  However, this one's a dud	0
B000BW36TY:she_won_for_a_reason!:mr._movie_"movie"	This is a really great CD. The Candian and American Idol winners are not usually that great, but Melissa is an exception.

B000HT2KVQ:musical_vicodin._prescription_unnecessary!_:jason_"hastaj00"	Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I?  This was obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing), and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year.  I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible to be letdown.	0
B00000DMDS:a_classic_game_with_a_refreshing_new_look.:	The game of memory is a great equalizer because little children are just as apt to remember where they saw the hidden images as older children or adults.  This makes it great game for the whole family to play together.   The images from the &quot;I Spy&quot; book illustrations are bright and  creative.  They don't match exactly- for instance, there might be two  images of cats, but borrowed from different photographs in the I Spy books.   So there is a bit more visual variety to spice things up.  This is a much  more attractive memory game than most, and would make an ideal gift for a  child or family	1

B000BS6HIU:good_fit/no_strap:d._a_shogren	The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before	0
B0002ZD7US:amazing:j._brady	This is just incredible. Many subtle layers of scents, non of them too strong or overpowering, despite the fact that this will stay with you all day long ( no need to respray, in other words, so it's a great value for the price ). I had  never tried a Burberry product before and quite honestly bought this on a whim because I was running low on cologne ( yes, I'm one of those types who has to wear something different every day ) and wanted to try something different. I am happy to say there is really nothing I can compare it too - and that's a good thing, it's not "samey" like so many men's fragrances out today, and not feminine at all. Very nice.	1

B000B8K7SG:long_time_user,_but_dissapointed:jason_h._wilkinson	I have been using Turbo Tax since 1998, I use computers every day, and (as an engineer) I am used to using difficult applications (Pro-E, Mathcad, UG, etc). This years edition of Turbo Tax Deluxe was the worst Turbo tax I have ever seen (& I usually like it very much). I purchased in January and had to update 4 times. One update took 6 hours (some of us live in the boonies and broadband is not an option). In addition, the application brought up menus and selections that were not applicable (farm income at the PA State form). When I tried to delete the entries (at the Federal level as instructed) they would not. My 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ("copy 2" and every time I deleted it, it would reappear on the next pass through. Every time I entered the "State" tab, it acted like I was never there before with a "Start State" button that always lead me through all the same questions (It did retain my answers from prior visits). Where was the "Continue State" button? I also noticed that using the "back" button and then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs to occur, even though the same "foreward" choices were made. Once I backed up to check something & then moving foreward caused my state tax status to jump from +$46 to -$1548!! Upon backing up I saw that some of the check boxes regarding the sale of my home were unchecked. I did not check them, but rather backed up two more screens, then moved foreward again the two screens and the boxes were again checked! One more foreward click and my taxes again returned to +$46. One of the years I liked best was when there was a "checklist" so you could see where you had been and what was already addressed. This years State was definetly worse than the Federal, but even that was a dissapointment. I did complete this years filings & submitted both online, I hope I don't get burned! Turbo Tax!-- Please improve for next year or it may be my last year. You realize that at 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year, and an accountant is looking attractive. If you are on the "inside" you probably know why this is happening...outsourcing code gen to India, not  outsourcing code gen to India, programmer cut-backs, programming application changes, archiving application changes, project management issues, whatever.

However he becomes a threat to the Matriarch of the town by the name of Aunty EmTeeVee (or something like that). Then Mel kicks a lot of butt in the process. This is a dismal tedious movie which is only redeemed by the fact that it was filmed in the Outback Opal Mining Town of Coober Pedy which I visited a few years ago	1

There's an especially helpful discussion on the effects of various popular diets like Atkins', Sugar Busters, and Protein Power -- pluses and minuses of each.	1
B0002L71PO:not_worth_it...:swm248	I've had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart (and I only weigh 100lbs).  I tried everything to fix the problem to no avail.  So considering it only lasted a few months, it really is not worth the money at all.  The price is cheap but so is the quality.  For what it will cost me to replace this one, I could've bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation	0
B000B5XOZC:a_bit_plodding,_but_funny_series_of_reversals:claudia_"celestial_girl"	A woman who lives in an apartment in NYC and can't cook and doesn't have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about. (She writes a very popular domestic advice column.) She succeeds, until a Navy hero wins the opportunity to spend Christmas with her in her house in Connecticut, enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby. Problem is, she doesn't have any of those things. She borrows the house (from a man who wants to marry her), she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house, and she even borrows a baby. The unmaking beings when she tells the Navy man her child is a boy, and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it's really a girl. Then the mother of the baby takes it back, and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one. Then the woman is falling in love with the Navy man (and he with her) while the man from whom she's borrowed the house still believes she's going to marry him, and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding.	0

338612	If you are looking for a dvd that is filled with White Stripes music and interviews, look elsewhere.  The item description says it has over 40 minutes of in-depth interviews, but it fails to mention that only about 10 minutes (if that) of this is actually with the band (and the 10 minutes are scattered throughout the 65 minute dvd).  It has interviews with members of various bands that have played with the White Stripes in the past and others who knew them when they were just beginning.  It is mildly interesting to hear about how the band got their start and other such details, but it is not something I will watch again.

B000077DCZ:beginners_--_forget_about_it:john	If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary).	0

They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest.

This game is a great compliment to mia reading as it reinforces literacy and other subjects like math and problem solving. We haven't played with the art part yet but I still think it's a great value for the other subjects. I'm really impressed how it helps to develop their cognitive skills and patience as one of my girls has a problem with concentration but found through the problem solving activities that she is overcoming these difficulties. Great product. Even my neighbours kids come over to play it!	1

B000HC0LW8:not_as_good_as_quickbooks_windows_experience:timothy_evans_"evansomd.com"	We have used QuickBooks on a PC since the 1990's.  We loved the way Inuit made accounting accessible for people without degrees in accounting.  QuickBooks for Mac is TERRIBLE in comparison.  If you plan to use the payroll features, it is unusable.  QuickBooks Mac payroll redirects you to the internet, where it is handled by PayCycle (an independent company).  Payroll is not integrated at all in the Mac (instead import/export operation). On the PC, it is part of the QuickBooks application.  We could not get job costing to work, and the tax calculations made no sense.  We were paying TONS of money to PayCycle, so fortunately the taxes were filed automatically.  We finally reverted back to QuickBooks for Windows and are MUCH happier with Intuit handling our payroll	0
B00067TA2Q:poor_durability:phyllis_purcell	We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.	0

1572522763:post_-_war_propaganda:freek	This film was probably made not to entertain the audience, but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on Bosnia. But it does so for a small part only, showing the Bosniaks and Serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion. With the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half-folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists. Its attempt to blind the viewer, hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper, is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality, but also through poor cinematografic form. The dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie. Handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss. The handling shows several onlogical moments. And as a concept of &quot;we all suffered and we Serbs did not start the war&quot; it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing. This movie does not entertain at all, and shows the events as unrealistic as any B - movie about Vietnamwar. And about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in Serbia. My rating is absolutely thumb down. Comparing with, for example, No Man's Land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former Yugoslavia. Instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war, You can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie	0

1294	Oh those were the days, when I was in college, reading my first issues and then subscribing.  There were great things to be found in its pages, columns by Brian Crozier, Russell Kirk, Erik von Kuenhelt-Leddhin (sp?).  The great struggle with the Soviet Union was going into a critical stage.

B0004M15FS:all_time_favorite:a._petitto	These little cakes are so good with coffee and a real treat especially when frozen.  They can be a little dry if eaten without a beverage, otherwise, but they are an all time favorite of mine since I was a little girl growing up in Brooklyn, NY.  This company also used to put out little cream filled cakes called Yankee Doodles, but I don't think they are around anymore.  I'm just glad Drake's was kind enough to keep one of them going and I'm glad I found a place where I could order them without bothering my sister in NY all the time.	1
B000ION79Y:a_poorly_done_movie,_not_worthy_of_seagal:s._sasse	I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film	0

The projected image can be rotated and focused, and even without my glasses, I can read it in the dark (and my eyes aren't that good). It will *not* be visible when the room is lit. It is great to be able to read the current time and remote temperature in the middle of the night when you wake up.	1

B0008FUD5Y:clunky,_hard_to_use_&_a_waste_of_$$:m._delehant_"mom_and_therefore_toy_expert!"	I have a BIG Dora fan in my house & this was one of her first Dora dolls (last year). She played with it for the first day or two...its loud, very mechanical, not very appealing. The toy saw a rebirth in use when it was discovered that it she could make Dora dance & terrorize the puppy. The doll only does one dance, regardless of what skirt she has on now. From reading other reviews, if I pushed & held it while she was wearing it she might ballet, but not worth the hassle! Since then, my Dora lover has received various other Dora dolls, so we have a collection that sings, dances, speaks various languages, and the ONLY one she plays with regularly is the Dress Up Adventure Dora - she's more posable, does something other than sing, and you can change her outfits. Perfect for my almost 5 year old	0
B00006JDRW:the_carry_on_collection:book_lover	Many, many years ago when I was a very young woman, I saw my first Carry On movie and went to see every one I could possibly get to.  Then, there were none.  Several years ago, my sister taped a copy of Carry On Cleo for me. I couldn't believe I still roared at the silliness only the Brits can successfully pull off.  It must have been fate that led me to look up "Carry On" on amazon a few months ago.  My heart skipped a beat when The Carry On Collection came up.  I instantly made it mine and have watched most movies several times.  My personal favorites:  Carry On Constable, Carry On Cowboy, and Carry On Cabby.  But they are all good.  I've loaned several movies to a Brit here in the office who has seen all 27-something of the Carry On series and who is now introducing them to his American family.  They love them, too.  If you love double-entendre done to perfection, don't miss this collection	1

I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again	0

B00006IEBI:good_professional_pen:a._r._coats	I've been using this model pen for over 15 years.  I started using this pen when I was in the military, where my job required me to transcribe live, foreign language radio transmissions.  My colleagues and I tried many different brands and models of pens, and for me this pen offered the best performance.  When speed is essential you learn to write small and the Extra Fine point is perfect.  Over the years I've noticed some problems with this pen, but nothing bad enough to make me choose another pen.  After beginning to use a new pen, if you leave it tip up for a long time (several months) it stops working.  Also, it is necessary to use a lighter touch with this pen. If you press too hard the tip will bend and if it bends too much the pen will be useless, so using this pen in a rough environment, i.e. trying to write while in a vehicle that is driving off-road, is not recommended.	1

B0003054XA:it_is_best_!!:polkadotty	My first and last beverage review.  I am gob smacked by this coffee.  What's that complex flavor?  I don't know but I've never had better and I've tried a lot of brands, gourmet and not so.  Smooth, nutty, winey, woodsy, whatever who cares I love it.  Maybe it's all that caffeine racing through my veins (I'm on my third cup) but I'm about ready to dance and break into song.  A polka would be nice.  Plus the fact that it's dedicated to a cat is extremely sweet.  And they practice social and environmental responsibility with their growers.  Way to go Seattle.	1
189458	Thank you for sharing Laci and your story with me.  This book is superbly written and shares with the reader a Mother's love for her daughter and angst over her murder.  How tragic to lose Laci.  How disgusting & heartwrenching what you had to  endure since Laci went "missing".	1
73384	After falling in love with Gourmet's yellow cookbook, I subscribed to Gourmet, hoping for the same great classic recipes and commonsense commentary.  Wow, what a disappointment.  I have just received my second issue and, as another reviewer said, it is about 90% ads for high-end luxury goods like jewelry and cars.  The 6-page "Special Advertisement Section" stops being so special when there are 20 of them in one issue! What happened, Ruth Reichl?  The few recipes that one can find are unattractive and/or too difficult for even weekend cooking.	0

BTW, I am using Belkin KVM cables.	0
B000EDGQVA:very_poor_product.:peter_domanski	As soon as I bought it I realized it doesn't hold the phone too well. Few days later my concerns proved them selves, every time I made a rapid movement or tried to run with it (even very carefully) the phone would unclamp itself from the holster and slam into the ground. Every time I was lucky to realize as soon as I droped it, untill today when after coming home from shoping I realized my z520a is no longer with me. There goes a $200 phone, lost because of a stupid $10 holster.  Do not buy this product, if you realy need a holster go with something like Sonyericsson's "ICE-26" that secures the phone with an extra flap on top so it dosn't slip out of the holster. As for me I gatta get me a new phone, shame I had the Z520 cell phone for about 4 months now and I really liked it	0

B00023K85C:lovely_but_a_bit_"flatter"_than_i_expected_them_to_be:shelly_v	I ordered these earrings thinking they'd be as round as the picture seems to imply.  They're really nice but honestly, they're not as round as they look in the image, which I found a tad disappointing at first.  They're not totally flat or anything like that but the drops look a bit "flatter" in person than they do in the picture.  I'm not blaming Amazon or Silver Insanity for it since they've done nothing wrong.  Products can look different in pictures than in person due to things like light and camera angles.  I just want to give notice to people who buy these earrings.  And yes, they are a substantial piece of jewelry as the previous reviews imply, but not so big that they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy.  They're very nice.	1

First package 'disappeared' at UPS.  When they shipped the first machine, it was evidently damaged and returned back to Amazon by UPS.

B000FBZQ1M:the_best_granola,_nay,_the_best_cereal..._ever.:the.	I first tried this granola when they had it at Costco, and since then, I was hooked. I was never a huge fan of granola to begin with. I usually liked the taste, but a lot of granolas were very hard and crunchy, even when eaten with milk. A lot of them were also either too sweet or not sweet enough. So when I tried this granola, it immediately blew away all my preconcieved notions involving granola.	1
B0000087QO:"millions_of_young_guys_once_had_a_love_and_it_was_a_gas":timothy_t._ward	Back when Blondie was being hailed as the biggest new-wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike, there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed Blondie as "bubblegum pop," and one group that would never have staying power. But I think it's been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh. Parallel Lines helped establish Blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success. This album is also the first where Debbie Harry's voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet, vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next. The album made punk, pop, and disco shake hands, which was a method unheard of in 1978. Songs like "Hanging on the Telephone," "Picture This," "Pretty Baby," and "Sunday Girl," have become irresitable pop gems, while "I Know But I Don't Know," and "Fade Away & Radiate," featuring a terrific guitar lick by Robert Fripp, are punk-driven classics. Last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in "One Way or Another," and "Heart of Glass." And how has Debbie Harry played out as lead singer after all these years? As Rolling Stone stated when this album was ranked #140 on their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "Madonna was surely watching."	1
B000M8PHLC:good,_but_specifically_for_700w!:robert_lewis_"silverleaf"	Overall I'm happy with the skin. It fits the Treo 700 very closely. This was custom formed for every curve, bump, and button on the Treo. My one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the 700w and 700p. I should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it. The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes. Well, the skin has images on the button covers for the 700w, not the 700p. Not a huge deal, just a slight annoyance. I'm going to see if there's a way to remove these somehow	1
42575	As someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier, organic way of life, I decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter.  Many did not strike my fancy.  For example, I found Organic Style Magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste, while Mind, Body, and Spirit Fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all.  Natural Health, however, falls somewhere in between, covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet, natural remedies, beauty, and food/recipes.  As someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy, I appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer.	1

I get asthma from wheat flour, so I've spent the last 8 years searching for the perfect flour.  I've been using this for years now, I love this stuff.  I use it for cookies, cakes, crepes, pancakes, waffles*, madalines, yorkshire pudding, flouring meats for crispy frying, thickening soups and sauces, etc etc.  The only thing that it hasn't worked for is bisquits.  I think because this flour needs a binding agent, such as eggs or Xantham Gum.  With just the butter the dough after baking falls apart.  flakey and yummy, but a total mess!	1

7711	This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, "stock" phrases, and "hanging" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my "seeking/hunting" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold	1
B000LQI2S0:cant_live_(sleep)_without_it!:s._brum	My mother in law thought it was reduculous to spend more that twenty bucks on one of these because she got one that has ocean sounds... birds.. ect.

This is the only sound we need!	1

B000GKL0YO:good_stroller_for_the_price:emily_martin	We like this stroller.  It seems to be pretty durable, and its weight and portability (shoulder strap) make it ideal for trips, especially in airports.  My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall (6'4"), but it is fine for me (5'3").  We like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline, but still sit up enough to watch what's going on.  He can hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet, so the various levels of the reclining back are nice.  Overall, a good stroller for the price	1

B0009OLSZ8:finally,_a_potty_that_works.:elliott's_mom	This is the third potty I've purchased for my son. The first one was made by Parents, and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it. The second was First Years Elmo 3-in-1, and the cup pinched his behind in 3 places leaving cuts. This one is great. Although my son was hesitant to go on it at first (which I attribute to his experience with the Elmo potty), he fits nicely on it. The other potties were too narrow from front to back, and I had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard. The seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom; and easy clean up. It's low enough to the ground that his legs fit too. The back and arm supports fit well also. It's a solid construction and good buy.	1
499857	Let's be honest...  a "kit lens" that adds approximately $70 to the overall price of a camera body is not supposed to be Canon L-series quality.  Sure, you can find a better quality lens, but not for $70 you can't!	1
B0009OVJ2U:memory_foam_remembers_to_be_squished_flat!:s._garcia_"court_reporter_mommy"	I was so disappointed in this product.  I bought the ad hook, line, and sinker, thinking that the memory foam was a great idea, that it would give me bilateral-plantar-fascitis-suffering feet some long-awaited relief.  After about 2 hrs of wear, the foam is completely flat, which leaves the formerly snuggly slippers sloshing around on your feet and you flapping about as if walking on cardboard. SAVE YOUR MONEY!  These are awful	0
388495	When I first heard there was an American version of L'Uomo Vouge I was really excited.  I thought "finally an American men's fashion magazine that'll be edgy, risky, creative & original!"  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This magazine is virtually indistinguishable from lackluster Men's magazines GQ, Esquire & Details.  European men's fashion magazines are works of art with cutting edge photography, bold reporting & beautiful advertising.  You won't find any of this in Men's Vouge.  The editors of this magazine have greatly insulted the intelligence of American readers.  If I could I'd give this magazine a negative 5	0

183362	Early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the New Republic as you explore their base, with no force powers. But events make a turn for the worse and you go to Luke and request for your lightsaber back. Then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark Jedi/killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game. With amazing graphics and increddible duels, this game is simply magnificent. Plus the multiplayer is awesome (especially when you play CTF and give the other team a boat load of Storm Troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so Stormtroopers makes the game a game you'll never want to trade in! Plus the duels are fun to play again and again. I would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult.  All in all a great game that any StarWars fan must own, any shooter fan really has to have, and if you like both, oooh you need it really bad	1
B000KFUK9Q:i_love_my_blackberry!!!!!!:heisy_"babygirl"	I just recently bought the Blackberry Pearl and I love the device. Its stylish, beautiful, small, and it has some awsome features. However, since i bought it from Amazon, Cingular took forever just to approve me and give me a new number. So I constantly had to call amazon and ask them about my order. Then I receive the phone almost a week later than the day I placed my order and as I follow the instructions my phone didn't want to work. So the representatives told me there was something wrong with my SIM card... when it wasn't. Luckily I called Cingular and a very HELPFUL representative helped me set up my account and ACTUALLY the service when Amazon told me there was something wrong with my SIM card LOL. Overall, Amazon should be more careful how they describe their phone activation process because it wasn't easy. But whatever I love shopping @ Amazon and I truly love my phone and I bet you will love it too. :)!!	1

B000062XG2:this_movie_is_for_people_who_love_books:m._fisher	This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?	1
B00021D31U:heavy_and_greasy:smiley	I used this product for a couple of months with no visible result. In addition it's quite greasy and since it's not made to be used on the face, we can understand that. But that makes it very hard to use along with sunscreen and whatever makeup one chooses.	0

143385	I was so excited to see this game come out- I loved the Godfather, and From Russia with Love, and the hype surrounding this game was incredible.  The actual game, however, was incredibly disappointing.  The driving controls, especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather, are AWFUL.  I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong, but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to.  Most of the missions involve driving, under a specific time limit, and with these awful controls, I gave up early- way too frustrating.  The musical play list that you get to control was fun, but I would have liked more free-roaming like in the Godfather.  I was also looking forward to hearing everyone's voices that were in the opening credits- Dale Earnhardt Jr???  But since I have almost totally given up on it now, I guess I won't get to hear their voice acting talent.  Does anyone know if they plan to re-release this on the xbox 360?  Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then.  This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to	0

B0000ACOXK:sent_it_back:sybil_a._bissell_"sybil_a._bissell"	Purchased for my daughter, an English teacher, Scrabble lover. She said she'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the Franklin she'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game. She said it would end up on a shelf in her house. She'd rather have a paperback Scrabble Dictionary. I returned the Franklin. She didn't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play Scrabble in class	0
2992	This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't	0
B00006L0D8:hate_it!:	When I was 9 I loved this magazine. It seemed so gown-up to be reading this when my friends were still playing dolls. Now when I read it all I find is trash. The magazine dosen't have one useful article in it. Unlike Seventeen or Cosmogirl! there are no real life stories or health articles just trash about stars. All the quizzes are the same thing. They repeat and repeat and repeat. And about the stars. Puh-leeze! I don't care if Hilary Duff is dating Joel or not, nor do I want to know if Ashlee Simson dies her hair herself or goes to a salon. I don't reccomend this magazine to anyone. If you have nothing to do than go ahead and read it, but you won't enjoy it if you've ever read a real magazine like Seventeen or Ellegirl	0
418460	I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.	1
B00068O764:new,_brighter,_smoother,_softer_skin_awaits_you.....:elizebeth_neumann	Calling this a peel doesnt seem quite right. When I think of the word peel I imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask. Or I think of something that is harsh or abrasive. While this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do.	1
B0007VTUB2:worked_great_then_dead:chelsea_linthicum	I loved my 4.1mp Sony Cypershot I got for Christmas in 2005. Then a few days after Christmas in 2006 the screen was getting these fuzzy lines in it. If I would tap the camera they would go away. But then a few days later I was taking pictures and the camera just stopped working. It would turn on but then shut off. I had this problem before with low batteries but I changed them and it still didn't work. It would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. So many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. SO SAD CAMERA DEA	0
B0001BW0RO:great_table:_compact_and_lightweight_yet_durable:a._longo	Despite what the other reviewer has said, this table is great. I delpoyed to Iraq with this table folded up nicely in my duffle bag with no problems. The table is lightweight, and stirdy as long as you set it up correctly. I use it for my laptop indoors, but outdoors it works great as well (provided a hurricane isn't trying to blow it around) Overall, it's a great table that's compact and easy to set up and break down. My only complaint is that the plastic tabletop slats are thin plastic and if you have any heavy items sitting in the middle of the table it will bow a little unless you place the items directly on top of the support beams. I'd buy another if I had the need for one, and everyone in Iraq has complimented me on it because they're stuck trying to find ironing boards or water boxes to set their laptops on.	1

489142	I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year.	0

The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!

As Darryl Hannah's naked preview to "Splash", she can be found splashing around in clear blue Ionian waters with her boyfriend (played by handsome Peter Gallagher) and his new French, female lover who lives and works in Greece and becomes part of their existing relationship. (Yes, clearly liberal European values here, as all three of them also splash around in olive oil, champagne and the villa waterbed!)	1

6304642946:still_a_rookie:	Richard Pryor is my all-time favorite stand-up comedian.  I consider him the best in the business.  But his performance in  &quot;Live and Smokin&quot; shows he's still just a rookie.  He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material   is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;Here and Now&quot;	0
309158	After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers	0
B0007ZF4U4:cute_but_low_quality:pebanoi	The gloves looked great online but in actually, the quality of the product was not what I imagined.  The gloves lacked padding on the inner hand and palm.  Instead, it had a thin sheet of nylon.  The closure was not secure enough so I was able to slip my hand out even with it fastened on.  On the bright side, the gloves were pretty and I had no problems returning the product back to Amazon.com	0
176816	I just finished HL2 on the Xbox and thought some of my observations might be helpful to other prospective buyers. My review is primarily concerned with my struggle between getting HL2 for PC or Xbox. I bought HL, HL Opposing Force and HL Blue Shift for the PC when they came out and thoroughly enjoyed them. Due to the HL2 Xbox price and the horror stories I'd read about having to be online to use the PC version of HL2, I decided to go for the Xbox version. Did I make the right choice?	1
B000J40G8I:everyone_is_human:andrew_koepke	This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.  Without giving anything away, this episode shows growth in 3 of characters as human beings.  Additionally, it has some inventive guest characters.  Finally, it presents some moral and ethical questions	1

187575	Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range	1

575168	This magazine is just one more reason why women think that men are immature, stupid, and boring.  The magazine does nothing but highlight and impress upon the superficial tendancies of men and in its so-called news coverage gives short details of events and people that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of good taste.  Don't bother	0
418464	The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks. Not all cell phones.  Know your phone and your aquisition before giving a bad review.  Great product	1
B000E9VPX8:seems_to_be_working:ann_greve	These bands were recommended by our son's summer camp and we were quite skeptical about them.  But they seem to be working very well and are comfortable to wear.  Our son likes them much better than the sprays and smelly lotions that we used to use and never really worked.  Before using these bands, his legs and arms were covered with bites.  We are very pleased with them and highly recommend them to others	1
B000LVAUQ2:disappointing_for_crocs:s._l._eaton_"historyfan29"	I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house	0

B000MKMXJ4:the_most_wonderful_product_ever!!!!:c._griffith	I was pretty wary of buying this because of the price, but it really is worth it. The can has lasted me almost a year, and it's not even empty! It's wonderful! I have very oily, acne prone skin with rosacea, and this stuff makes me look like I have a flawless, beautiful complexion. And I'm not exaggerating. It feels like I'm not wearing makeup. I just can't say enough about it. This is the one thing that I couldn't live without. You need to try it!!!	1
B000E48IOM:tastes_great!:dee	I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them	1
434688	I've had this magazine for the past year and have used several of the tips, activities, posters, etc.  However, I have also gotten endless emails from Mailbox promoting products and asking me to renew way in advance.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  For the last three or four weeks, they've been calling me on the telephone every day.  This continues though I asked them to stop.  The few good ideas in each $6 issue are nowhere near worth the trouble of dealing with this harassment	0
B00000EWFU:joyful_sounds,_not_slicked_up_for_american_ears:eric_pfeiffer_"musicmad"	This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing	1

437448	Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.	0

B000FVU4A0:i_hope_i_don't_have_to_return_this_one.:m._naganand_"got_coffee?"	i've had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest.  Replaced it with a $20 MR. Coffee 4 cup from Walmart, which eventually, let water out the front, the back, the side, etc... creating a puddle just like the leaky braun.  Threw that out and went to a 12 cup Hamilton Beach that I had received as a gift.  What a POS... It had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also, the crap leaked as well, and when I lifted it, water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor.  After reading reviews on the Net and countless hours of searching for a good price, i was ready to buy the BUNN stainless steel.  I almost bought the Bodum electric Santos until I read that for some users, the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature.	1
B0006ZN4Z2:orgasmic:s._goldberg_"gourmet_snob"	These are the best berries I've ever tasted!  I thought for sure they were sweetened, but they're not.  The berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them.  Additionally, the slices are whole, with very little breakage in the can.  The value you get is pretty great, considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries.  At $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad, and you can have these year-round, even when strawberries aren't in season	1

B000GPSZ42:this_program_sucks_on_the_pocket_pc._buy_iguidance_instead:s._mohsin_"deshoom"	I bought this program because I wanted to use it on the pocket pc (DELL Axim X50v).  The program is very confusing to use.  It took some time to load on the PPC first, then you have to load the maps.  I tried to load the map of the whole state and it wasn't working. The map would come up and the gps reciever would pick up where I was, but when I would write an address of a street that exists, it would say "SEARCH DONE, NO MATCH FOUND."  I called the Delorme support many times, they helped me go through the application, but I feel that this application wont give me directions that I want off of the PPC.	0

B00007BKUO:cheaply_made_and_hard_to_put_together...:colleen	Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 & 9 year old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the "bounce". The more your child  weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money	0
B0009VPFHI:great_taste_and_cute_tin:a._lee	I got this as a recommendation from a friend and I found this to taste really wonderful. It comes in a cute small tin and a small measuring spoon.

45747	I can't get enough of Okami! I've beaten it and am started on a second play-though. Any action-RPG game fan has to at least try this game! The title basically says it all. It is a typically Japanese play on words, since, depending on how you translate it, "Okami" can mean either "wolf" or "king of the gods". For those people to whom that is not enough information to really understand the game, here are the basics:	1

She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out "Whodunnit" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives	1
B00005AAXE:best_dashboard_cd:mr._gregory_griffin_"gregory"	My personal favorite dashboard cd.  Every other one of their cds have maybe a few good songs that I like, but the places you have come to fear the most has pretty much a solid tack lis	1
B0009K5UOC:olga_does_it_again!:hallie_engel	This is a lovely, lovely bra.  It supports, lifts, and minimizes, creating a flattering shape underneath clothing.  The wide straps are gentle on the shoulders, leaving no ugly marks after long periods of wear.  The back doesn't ride up, and the three hooks serve as a strong anchor.  The plunging lace neckline is invisible even under a tight t-shirt, and dare I say it, looks pretty sexy.  Yes, you can be well supported and attractive- bless ye, St. Olga	1
B00074T4EC:high_quality:some_guy_"some_guy"	Very high quality/durability. This glove works well as it should. Only complaint (splitting hairs here) is that it gets pretty hot pretty fast, and your hand will sweat. If you are an extreme sweater, you may want to sacrifice the quality construction of this glove for one that is more well ventilated.	1
B0009JKGTM:a_tried_and_true_classic:jen_sb_"rabble_rouser"	Fiestaware ROCKS!  The turquoise place setting is beautiful...It is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com...Fiestaware is functional, calssic and fun- I love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this.  I highly recommend mixing and matching Fiestaware. I mix up colors that you wouldn't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	1

525133	I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.	0
B000077DCZ:very_good_for_beginners:c._litherland	This was given to my son who is going to be living in China this summer and presently knows no Chinese.  He's worked hard with this program and at least appears to be getting the tonal quality correct which is key in this language.  A microphone is a must with this program.

B0008GJQY2:excellent_product!:jess	My hair stylist first introduced me to this product a few years ago and I've used it ever since. It makes your hair really soft and shiny and even smells good.

B0009I6RFK:poor_quality,_but_dominos_are_still_dominos:j._fike	The truck gets clogged up often, it is extremely difficult for our kids to load and they almost always require an adult to load.

B000063XV7:the_twizzler_is_great.:	I bought my girls, ages 7 and 4, this product earlier this spring. It was easy to assemble, but finding the right height at which to hang it was a fairly time consuming process.  It has been up for 4 months now and has seen daily use. When our play group meets here, the kids line up to have a turn, over and over again.  I would recommend this for children who are reasonably coordinated and who have enough upper body strength to hold themselves up by their hands.  A very durable product and a fun physical activity	1

He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy	0
B000JD57DS:best_phone_case_i_have_ever_owned:kezzer_one_"john"	I bought this case for my LG Chocolate and it is perfect.  The belt clip is very strong, making accidental unclipping rare. The pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts.  The front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets.  The bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the Chocolate's "End" button.  This allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case.  The only dislike I have is the name "Cellnet" embossed on the front flap, but this is not really a big deal.  I would recommend this case to anyone who owns a Chocolate	1
B000H42PQG:can't_beat_the_price!!!!!!!!:kimberly_m._severance_"kim"	I bought this for my 3yr old son, he loves to sing and make music.  The size of the guitar is perfect for him.

I have arthritis and my sister got the litter maid, but that ended up having to be scooped on a regular basis which was hard on me.  I actually enjoy working with this.  The only drawback is sometimes smaller clumps of litter can get stuck below the drawer, but using really good litter, and not too much of it stops that.  I told my sister she should replace her own litter maid with this	1

B00004XT0D:?!:eric_belcastro	I really don't want to be mean, but I find this album very shallow.  Classical Indian music is a very complex, subtle and beautiful thing.  Comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience, but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple-minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy-washy "world music" cliches.  I don't find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting.  And this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything, I have delved deep into the avante guard, minimalism, "new music", eastern and western music theory, microtonal, etc. I would recomend jsut being a non-westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing.  However if your mainstay is jungle/drum&bass, then this would be a step up for you, so go for it, it is worth the pruchase in that case	0
B000NNDZK6:best_phone_by_cnet:andrei_ciura	yes, it's a tie with the Sony Cybershot K790a for the best multimedia phone so far on the market (at least until the iPhone will show up, then the game is on again). i am still contemplating whether to renew my tmobile contract for 2 more years and get this phone for $100 or drop my previous one and get a new contract..	1

B000ALCJRQ:couldn't_compare_to_the_chi:r._storms	I have very thick, very coarse, wavy hair. When my two year old CHI straightening iron broke, I needed to replace it quickly!  Locally the only iron I could find was the T3 Tourmaline iron, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It cost more than the CHI, was sold at a fancy salon, and could even be used on damp hair.  Surely it would be a good replacement.	0
B0009OAFU2:gets_the_job_done:s2kman	This model was given to me as a gift almost two years ago.  I bought another off of Amazon because the recharge cord had a short in it, and I figured I could use a second one to keep in my travel bag.  I'd have to say I'm pretty pleased with the trimmer.  I like the fact that the guard slides up and down to the appropriate setting instead of me having to keep up with 4 or 5 individual plastic guards that have to be changed out when I want to change the trimming depth.  I use it a few times a week, and it seems that it can go for months without needing a charge.  The little vacuum that sucks the trimmings into the little holding area is not the strongest....It's catches probably 70% of what I trim.  You'll want to be sure you're standing over a sink or towel when using it.  Well worth the $30 I spent for this grooming tool	1
B000F5GKJA:rubbish!!!:austin_"aust"	Chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again. FFTMC and BTS were lush and beautiful productions. NIcks latest attempts have been pathetic...from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint...even his older 'pop' remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he's doing these days...no, we're not saying recycle the older productions, but instead it's a matter of putting the effort and 'originality' in the profuctions...a signature if you will...and hey, it doesn't have to pigeon hole you if done with class...yes, how the mighty have fallen...	0
B0000CEOOG:fiesta!:anna_marie_grover	Perfect size bowls for fruit and maybe a side dish for those of you who don't like their food all running together on your plate.

There are no new sequences, just remixes of the Shakti sequences.  Since you can rearrange all the Shakti sequences on your own, Solar Flow is superfluous.  I don't feel a lot of shanti being swindled into purchasing the same thing twice.  A little disclosure please!	0
369827	I ordered this game based on reviews alone.  It's great!  Will not disappoint.  The only flaw is that some evidence is very specific, even when something else can be objected.  Other than that a great game.  Hope to see a sequel	1
B0001CU1C4:1st_edition_was_better:charles_d._storrs	The 1st version of this game was a fun and exiting game for my family. but we soon got bored of the same video over and over.

B000FWAHVA:a_very_different_mascara-i_love_it!!!:sammy_madison	I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it".  Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind	1
B00006L1B7:don't_miss_this_one:s._annetta	This is one of the best home dcor magazines around today, and by far the best in the Australian market.  Vogue Living is always a great read, and is always full of beautiful and inspiring photographs.  It regularly shows some of the most beautiful homes in Australia, and around the world.  So, if you're interested in Australian style, or just love looking at inspirational interiors, then Vogue Living is for you.  I never throw a copy away	1
B000JGCQGQ:what_about_the_missing_episodes:sebastiano_"scc"	Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do..	0
B0001XDU2Q:great_cleanser,_but_try_the_algae_cleanser_first.:mrpuddles	This is a great cleaner, but I'd suggest getting the Anthony Algae cleanser first.  This glycolic facial cleaner does prep your face for a good shave, but overdries.  It is not suggested for those who have dry skin or acne problems	1
B00083HIRC:i_love!!!_this_toy:	This toy is so cool! I use it all the time with my friend Erica.You could text message each other and it even takes pictures .My parents bought it for me at christmas . They were happy because they did not have to pay a phone bill or for minutes! This toy is so cool ! Now i do not have to beg my parents for a real cell phone!!! I highly recomend for any one who is reading this to get this toy!	1
B0000A0RS3:maternity_shorts_:robyn_m._lowenstein_"robyn"	just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them.	0
B000F9LRYO:digital_recorder_for_your_ipod:d._lange_"musician,_music_educator"	The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.	1
B000J0T6Q0:good_case_if_you_don't_wear_it_on_your_belt:paul_ko_"gadgetor"	Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.	0
B000F6SLM8:excellent!:effingham_hoofnickel_"bandman160"	This snack is superb in several ways.  First it is very good tasting.  The flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie.  Nutritionally, it has quite a bit of protein, very very low in simple carbohydrates (or sugars) and is high in fiber.	1
B00006HO3O:piece_of_garbage:sameer_matta_"sameer"	This item is an all around piece of garbage. After about 3 months of light use, it is stuck in 45 rpm mode. I sometimes use my thumb to slow down the player to 33 rpm mode. Don't buy this piece of garbage, unless you like owning garbage, in which case this is right your alley, the Garbage Alley. I wouldn't even give this to a bum, because I would feel bad about it.	0

B00067X4PK:newest_model_fixes_prior_problems:timefortea	"I ordered three penagain pens for gifts since I liked one I recently bought at Postal Annex. It seems the pen from Amazon has a NEWER and BETTER clip design and a BETTER ink cartridge -- fixing the problems people have complained about in earlier posts of cap clip wearing out and poor ink flow. After years of keyboarding and some carpal tunnel issues, this pen works superbly for me. Love it!	1
B000EQDKIO:amazing_for_dry/damaged_hair:megan_orr_"megan"	I love this product.  It has healed my brittle hair after being bleached one too many times.  I use it every day and it not only heals and conditions my hair but it holds my style in place.	1
B000BGI5CS:freakin'_awesome:aaron_roath_"professional_nerd"	This is something that I have wanted for a very long time.  When I first starting seeing the Bowflex on those terrible TV Infomercials, I thought, "Wow, what a piece of garbage."  Later on, while serving in the US Air Force over seas, my squadron had managed to tactically acquire one.  Along with the rest of our daily regiment of physical training, a few of us would spend half an hour or so each on this odd looking apparatus.  It quickly became obvious that this was, in fact, not a piece of garbage.  Just as the few of us using it were showing some impressive results and starting to convince the rest of the squadron of its worth, we were deployed to various points of interest throughout the Middle East.  When we returned, the Bowflex was gone and we were all very upset about it.	1
B0009JQROU:raves_for_hp:lisa_higgins_"bearloverb4u"	I bought this for my mother...she loves it! Its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view.  The print quality is excellent.  I got more (merchandise and quality) with this HP brand than I would had with any other brand.  The price was excellent too.  Good job Hewlett Packard for making me a "smart" person	1
B000M8PHLC:just_what_i_expected!:n._kirtley	The silicone protective covering for the Treo was exactly what I wanted and just what I expected it to be.  It fits my Treo 650 perfectly and I couldn't be happier.  I am going to buy another in a different color	1

B00004SUID:excellent_inexpensive_stemware:landscape_w._shipwreck	I've been using Spiegelau wine glasses for several years, and they are excellent. The bordeaux glass is great for bordeaux or any merlot or cabernet sauvignon based wine. These glasses are designed to enhance the bouquet of those types of wine. (They're also not bad for Rhones, though I prefer the Reidel Vinum syrah glass.)	1
B0002FOBJY:terrific_music_stand:history_buff	I bought this stand because I wanted the bigger lip for both my music books and my violin bow to rest on.  It works perfectly.  Very sturdy, very easy to adjust.	1

B0000541TL:urban_legends,_the_worst_movie...:garrett_yarbrough	I really enjoyed the first urban legends movie, but this one I was not impress by at all.  I wish I would have taken these reviews more seriously that I read before buying this dvd.  This was an awful cheapo urban legends movie.  Theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was.  I see now theres a third urban legends movie out, im not sure if that ones good or bad, like this one.  If you have a couple of bucks to blow, go ahead and get this one.  If you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie, look else where.	0
B000EGWNGY:overpriced_--underprotected:cjg_"cjgnyc"	Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not.	0
B000F2JIVA:good_value:b._sueyoshi_"animationcrazy"	It's not the best grill in the world, but for the price it does the job well enough.  It cooks unevenly.  The front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center.	1
B000LRN2CK:a_barbie_remote_control!:e._osorio_"doubletroublesmama"	We finally bought these Barbie Magic of the Rainbow dolls for our 4-year-old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired. At first, they were very excited to play with them. Positives: The doll is durable. It encourages participants to follow instructions. Negatives: I notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the DVD "hears" the instructions.	0
5094	I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product	0
B0000A0AIS:best_purchase_when_rounding_out_the_survival_kit:escape_from_taurine_"c.j."	After setting booby traps for Zombies, I like to whip out my Bushnell Waterproof scope and wait for the oncoming herds to trample on in.  This scope is just great because it cuts down on glare and is also waterproof.  It is good to have some foreward advancement of options when dealing with the zombies so when you are set up this scope can give you good range in spotting them on your trail!!	1
524304	My husband is Icelandic, and unfortunately this book was NO help at all... It's perfectly fine for the traveller, but in trying to live everyday life, conversing with new family members forget it. I would have liked to have seen a more comprehensive grammatical section, something that was laid out in something easy to look at and understand. If you are quite serious about learning this language I would honestly recommend saving the 20 bucks and buying the bit more expensive Colloquial Icelandic.  For me at least, it's quite easier to understand, has complete grammatical charts in the back, as well as a fairly decent dictionary...  Again, if you are only learning for business trips and such, then this would be a good option... For those of us actually moving there, her book is not so good..	0

B0000X610K:standby_loser:thomas_m._frier_"redleg66"	Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.	0
B000BMEYFO:i_love_this_car_seat,_and_it_works_great_in_our_car!:erin_m._wilson_"olivia's_mommy"	I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn, and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews.  And we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl.  I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car, but it was a BREEZE.  I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes.  My car has the LATCH system, and it has worked great.  My daughter loves being in her car seat, and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it.  I was surprised to read the other reviews, since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat.  I would highly recommend this seat to any parent	1
B0000DK6II:noisy!:d'artagnan_"the_maverick"	A nice idea that doesn't provide adequate audio quality in my experience. The unit would pick up "noise" from the operation of my CD player, resulting in a background squealing that was especially audible between tracks. In addition, on trips I had to frequently flip through the various frequency settings to avoid conflicts with radio stations	0
B0001YR20G:getting_impatient:james_e._straut	the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it	0
0935619003:best_cookbook_i've_used!__(i'm_a_true_cajun!):	Cajun Cuisine is, without a doubt, the best Cajun cookbook that I've ever used.  I was born and reared in Southern Louisiana, and the recipes detailed within closely mirror the exact techniques, seasonings, and spices  that I had learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens, and  how I was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting camp.  You  CANNOT go wrong with this book!                                    Jacque	1

Shawn Michaels: This no-talent hack is a washed up skank whose career sank.

B000AA879Q:good_software_and_fun,_too:bumsted	I have not spent tons of time working with the program yet, but have done enough to know that the learning curve is reasonable if you are somewhat publishing program literate.

B000HCQKTG:great_phone..:oscar	this phone has all the feature that i wanted. The camera takes really good picture.  Better than all the phone i've seen so far.  The xenon flash really helps taking night pictures.  I use to own the w800i and this one takes way better pictures.  It has auto-focus and other several fucntion that i haven't used yet.  The mp3 player is also very useful.  I love how u can just drag and drop mp3 files to the phone.  It also very easy to navigate through the phone functions.  My computer had no problem recognizing the phone once the drivers were loaded.  it's just like plugging in a flash drive.  The screen is very bright and clear.  The screen resolution is decent.  It's very easy to customize also.  I dl program online to customize the theme.  The battery lasted a lot longer than i expected. Usually last around 3-4 days.	1

B000CD6DII:don't_buy_unless_looks_dont_matter:kent	So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again	0
B0006J31X8:ridiculous_looking!:kelly_a._tanner	I bought these for my dad for Christmas and they did not fit his head, they didn't even fit mine and I have an average size head. Another thing, they did not look cool at all, they were ridiculous looking, nothing like the Photoshopped pictures	0

6301163788:karate_kid_for_adults:j._urban_"u2fan4ever76"	I remember the first time I saw the movie on TBS in the U.S. As usual, I started watching half-way into it and I was amazed by an unknown actor/star (Van Damme) who captivated my interest with some of the most awe-inspiring martial arts moves I'd have ever seen at the time. As a young teenager, this movie was very inspiring (to get involved in martial arts).	1
B00007ELER:one_of_the_sickest_movies_ever:ashutosh_jogalekar_"(joglekar)"	I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie.	0
580753	I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website	1
B000JD0FQ2:snssung_d807_doesn't_fit_well:paula_jackson_"mom2layna"	I bought this for my new Samsung slider phone (which I love) but this case is to snug for it.

1560259795:pure_fiction:amanda_m._aronson_"i_got_it"	Not even worth finishing this book!  This author does not know enough to even write this book!  I have personal connections with Blackwater and I know not one of the employees is even close to what he makes them out to be.  It is a one sided story not based on facts, which it what most writers do, but purely fiction!  The only few misfortunes Blackwater has had is what he bases his book on, not the postive stories that I hear about everyday.  Don't waste your money	0

B0001MRGKE:book_light:a._simms_"mom_of_2"	I bought this Lightwedge for my daughter who is 7. I found out that after I put her to bed, she could not go to sleep right away. She would use a flashlight to do little reading. Well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light. It shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes. My only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes. I ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks. They should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes. But it does do the job	1
B000052XPB:fast_acting_-_natrual_scent!!!:m._holmes	This stuff works wonders for my son's sensitive bum... and FAST!  We usually see results in just one application - usually by the next changing the irritaion is GONE or nearly so.  It also has a very natural/herbal scent which further outweighs other barrier creams.  It may seem a little pricey on a per ounce comparison, but I've found that I don't need to use as much, which makes that argument mute	1
0790734621:read_the_book_instead:becky_"looks_like_i_picked_the_wrong_week_to_quit_sniffing_glue"	"The World According to Garp" is on my top 5 list of favorite books of all time.  It's one of those rare books that makes you laugh out loud, but still really feel the emotion of the characters, and the story really sticks with you.  (I made a joke about an Ellen Jamesian just the other day, lol ~ yes, it was a dumb joke that no one else got, but, that's how it goes sometimes :)  I was introduced to the book in college, well after the book and the movie were released, but I had never heard of either one.  I read the book in just a couple of days ~ I couldn't put it down, and I chatted it up with everyone who would listen.  I've re-read it several times since then, and i still think it's terrific.  Naturally, when i found out there was already a movie . . . I was thrilled!  I ordered it right away . . . but i wish i'd never wasted my money.  On it's own, the movie might be alirght.  But when you're invested in the book, when you know the characters, Robin Williams just isn't Garp.  I love Robin Williams, he's a great comedian, that's not a question.  I just think that the casting for this part was way off base.  and if you can't believe the main character, the rest of it's crap.   If you've never read the book, I highly recommend it!!	0
B00023JUCO:attractive_item;_lousy_accompaniments.:warlock_one	I ordered this jewelry piece with the gift box and card.  The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on.  The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down.  Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script.  I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store.  I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos.  I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the "frills"- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it	1

B0007G8RJI:a_great_comfortable_pump.:raven_miller	This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box.  It looks great with a skirt or slacks.   My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy.  I have the shoe in black.  If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available	1
B000FCA0P8:dazzle_products:deborah_j._langford	I've had dazzle products in the past. Usually a very good product, This DVD Recorder is just not very reliable. I would recommmend spending a little more and getting one of the higher end dazzle products	0
B00005WV4J:outstanding__book!:clear_thinker	Has there ever been anyone like Richard Nixon? For sheer resiliency,he stands alone in American history. No one won bigger than Richard Nixon.  And no one lost bigger than Richard Nixon. And then won again. And then lost. And won again. He just kept punching and planning and working, to eventually become one of the dominant figures of the 20th Century.	1

565427	It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.	1

0684803062:excellent_resource:	This book is a very good resource for parents of underachievers, former underachievers, and anyone who wants to understand the success of their child. Having read other reviews by readers discounting this book and discounting human psychology itself, I was compelled to write my own review. No one blames parents, especially Dr. Rathvon they do the best they can with what they've got; mental resources specifically.

B00004S300:terribly_disappointed!!!!__curse_words!!!!:rhonda_g._crow	I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.	0

603294	This was a gamble since it isn't cheap and the results promised are no different from any other supplement ad campaign.  I only tried Muscle Milk because I read up on it after seeing it endorsed by an NFL athelete during an ESPN interview. I started using it about 2 months ago and have been consistant with the servings daily. Two months later my strength has increased, my mass has increased and my body fat has noticeably diminished. My workout routine and diet was always the same before starting on MM but the results since using MM have made an impact, there is nothing else I can attribute it to. The fact that it also tastes great is a nice bonus but given the definite results of MM I would still use it if it tastes like battery acid. Do not fool yourself, it is loaded with fat. It relies on you to workout steadily and maintian a clean diet for you to realize it's true benefit. You will not get sculpted by using MM without commitment, you will only get fatter. But if you are committed and use MM as suggested it will most certainly produce a change in your appearance.	1

B00005Y6Y4:atrocious_travesty_of_a_minor_dostoevsky_work:inframan	This is the worst ripoff of a major literary work I have ever seen. It takes colossal gall (to say nothing of immense bad taste) to take the bare bones of a Dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave Dostoevsky's own personal travails as narrative interstices. All done with no flair for nor flavor of the original.	0

I downloaded it just now and entered the new questions regarding the hybrid and was told I had a credit of $3,100.  However, it never added this number to my total tax credits.

137695	Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects.	1

B000IO4MV6:well_worth_it.:tony_wong_"usopsama"	Before seeing it with my own eyes, I was a little skeptical of the huge buttons. After wearing it, I felt they were hardly noticable.

The pockets on either side are so huge that you can practically store a couple of cell phones in there	1

Though I have not tried it using Windows Media 10 yet. I recommend at least buying the Archos Docking Adapter Kit (if you do not plan on using the Archos to record programs). It allows you to charge the unit without the computer and also allows you to connect it directly to your digital camera to transfer photos.	1

0393312836:a_thoughtful_exploration_of_human_nature_and_freedom_of_choice.:monika_"equestrienne_23"	Unlike most dystopian novels, which tend to focus on what may happen to government in the future, "A Clockwork Orange" focuses on the nature of the individual in the future. Our protagonist is Alex, only 15 years old but already a habitual criminal, roving the streets with his band of friends, taking advantage of every opportunity to wreak havoc on the world around him. The boys have no qualms about attacking the helpless. In fact, the more helpless the victim, it seems, the more pleasure the boys take in the act. The most interesting and disturbing aspect is that the boys manage to maintain a strange sort of innocence even as they commit the most heinous and violent crimes. They aren't doing any of this out of malice toward their targets; in fact, it seems to matter very little who they pick as a victim. They are creating mayhem just because it's fun for them.	1

519165	I am a fan of Arena Football.  I enjoy watching it because it is exciting, but this game doesn't live up to the real game.  The game is very similiar to NFL Blitz except NFL Blitz is better.  What makes Unleashed worse is  there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass.  The most action  comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each  other up.  If you are thinking of buying this game, rent it first to see if  it is really worth the money	1
B000B1VU7A:perfect_pick_me_up!:p._castellana	I have loved this product for so many years, but haven't found it for more than ten.  I flew to Spain and the Evian was an absolute necessity!  It's just the right amount of cool water as opposed to splashing water on your face out of a faucet.  It is very refreshing, and also brightens fading makeup.	1
154973	This is the best diet product ever!  I tried them all and "SKINNY WATER?" is the easiest and cheapest diet idea ever.  The product taste great and it really removes any desire to eat too much.  I drink just 3 bottles a day and so far the pounds just melt away.  I lost 15 lbs. in 20 days.  Great taste, it works great, and it's so inexpensive.  Great job to who ever came up with the idea of drinking water and losing weight.  The owners should hire me to do commercials for them	0

446385	The first version of Easy CD Creator I used was CD Creator 4 basic. It was okay, pretty much what it said it was: basic. I got the upgrade to that from an Ebay auction and it worked pretty good. Later due to lack of support by the manufacturer for new CDRW drives in good old version 4, I upgraded to CD Creator 5 Platinum (The version being sold here.) This too worked pretty good - for a little while. Then the operation was moved over from Adaptec to Roxio, and from that point onward, things have been more thorny than rosy.	0
B000JNP0D0:in_praise_of_bouncy_seats:sahm-i-am	Now that I've caved to the power of pink (it only took three girls for me to finally give in), this turns out to be very cute and was the second cheapest I could find.  Quality seems fine (two weeks post purchase) and who doesn't love a tool that keeps the kiddo safe and calm while one does dishes or makes dinner for the rest of the brood...?  For the first babe, we were given a different seat that aimed to be an improvement over the classic and very simple bouncy seat, but had so many functions it was basically useless.  This is a case, though, where the basics are the best.  In looking around for a new one, saw many for $100; if you can stomach the not-as-posh aesthetic, this seems like a great value for a seat that will only used for a few months, anyway	1
389627	The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.	1

I would not recommend this razor	0
385651	Not Only Black + White is a great Australian magazine, and of top quality.  I used to buy it in bookstores here in New Zealand, but they don't seem to be available here anymore.  I am not subscribing to it, but I'd keep getting them if they were available in bookshops where I live.  I emailed the publisher twice about this, but I didn't get any response.  Aside from that, this is a great mag (yes, it has fine art nude pictorials as well as lots more) and one that you would hang on to like a "coffee table" book rather than treat like a typical magazine.  It has a thicker cover and pages than normal magazines too.  For a magazine, you could almost rate it a 5, but nothing beats a proper book (no advertising, etc), so I rate this a 4.  Aside from the photography, it also makes a good reference for page layout and typographical ideas as well, for anyone into desktop publishing	1
422322	All of us have a dark side.  Unfortunately AUTO FOCUS focuses on this small subset of actor Bob Crane's life and expands it out of proportion.  In doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of Crane's life and career as window dressing.  Even the screenplay is, at best, an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of Bob Crane and John H. Carpernter  -- since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice-accused murder suspect.	0

B0000897EG:poor_casting,_predictable_story:a._vegan	Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl	0

I had previously only used unpadded gloves, and the padding in the palm seemed a little thick at first.  The padding does make it more difficult to get a solid grip in some exercise machines that also have large rubber grips on them (lat pulldown bars, for example), but that's the trade off for excellent support and protection when using the gloves on machines with uncovered metal grips.	1

This is NOT covered under your warranty. My camer has been in the repair shop for 3 weeks now and since the camera is so new there is no parts available yet. So I am sitting here with no camera, which is really bothersome since I Love taking pictures. I figured I would spend more for a nice quality camera and have no worries but who knew this would happen! So I highly recommend this camera but you MUST be VERY VERY careful with it!	0

The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran	0
B00022WA5Y:bought_two_--_both_died_on_me:e._r._vines	This hair dryer did dry my hair quickly. BUT, it quit working after a month. I exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later.	0
B0006NIW0G:this_stuff_smells_great!:computer_chick	I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more	1
131788	Dave Alvin's sublime new CD is a cadre of songs written by Californians either born and/or who grew up in this land. The lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises. It is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state. Dave Alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said "infiltrates your brain like a shot of Jack Daniels."	1
B000E1DR28:not_a_very_good_cheesecake_taste...:linda	This Jello cheesecake mix is not nearly as tasty as their Sugar-Free Banana Cream mix (that one tastes like *real* banana cream!).  This mix does not have the flavour of cheesecake, and also has a vague chemically taste.	0

B000308F9U:in_the_garbage_it_goes.:t._gilbert	The self cleaning concept was the reason I bought this razor. The razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad. After owning the razor for two months I noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after I had just refilled the fluid. After a closer inspection I found out that the fluid had leaked out all over, and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn't metal or plastic. I thought maybe I had done something to cause the problem so I refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process. Immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together. It is now headed to the landfill. The trimmer does not work well either	0
B0002E51RQ:play_like_a_pro_without_the_price:tc_george	This is a relatively affordable harmonica; it has a good feel- the holes are well spaced.

B000E4ARC8:you_may_not_be_able_to_stop_eating_this!:kdg_"econkate"	Wow - this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label: "Warning - Highly Addictive."

570392	Wow - that's all I can say. All the positive reviews really piqued my interest on this 'game'. Just got it a few days ago, and am SO IMPRESSED with all that's packed into it!!! It also teaches proper form for a ton of different toning and stretching excercises. This is going to become a regular part of my workout regimen. People of all fitness levels can enjoy this. This technology (interactive virtual trainers/serious home workouts) has got to be the wave of the future!!	1

B000JZ96XI:great_compact_case_for_the_pearl:andrew_s._newton	I used the Seidio rubberized case before this. It is thinner and the Pearl is barely noticed in a pocket. This case is about 1/2 inch wider and thicker, but it protects the phone on all sides except the top. The phone slips in and out effortlessly. It looks great, and the magnet puts it to sleep, which is nice. Even though it is a bit more bulky I can't go back to the Seidio because of the protection and looks. I just use a screen protector, but many use Best Skins Ever with it no problem. It's also pretty cheap ($15). Less than the Seidio and other pouches out there.	1
B00004WGML:poor_jack_in_the_box:	I am very unhappy with this product.  The handle is hard to turn, and it takes too long for the clown to pop up.  When the clown does pop up it smells like a forst fire inside of the toy.  Over all I would not recomend it	0
228364	I got this camera for my 17th birthday last summer, and it's great. As much as I'd love to have a Canon Powershot, it's a bit out of my price range. All the people who think that using the LCD screen runs out the batteries after &quot;2-4 pictures&quot; are lying to you. I bought rechargable batteries from radioshack, and I've taken up to 400 picture without the batteries needing to be changed. This is a good camera with good quality in good lighting. In dark or overcast situations, it can look a bit grainy, but that's easily photoshopped. I recommend that when uploading, plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter, because uploading sucks all battery power right out. I recommend this for someone who hasn't owned a digital camera before, or for someone that wants good quality at a not-so-crazy price	1
418457	I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	0
B0002E4N70:easy_to_use,_i_reach_for_these_first:t._j._turner	I've been using these for a couple of months and every nasty, gloppy mess I throw in it, including shortening, butter, cream cheese, sour cream and others have slid right out and cleaned up perfectly fine. I spend less time cleaning up then I would have with glass as more is pushed out. I haven't had any problems with them sticking and have yet to find a complaint with one and have gone so far as to aquire a 1 cup version. They both sit out and are never put away as my glass measuring cups are	1
B00004RAME:upgraded_after_15_years:m._maria	Amazon service and Weber quality!  Replaced a few parts on my Weber grill to extend its life.

My Weber grill is up for more than another 15 years of great grilling	1
B000FTLN02:definitely_improves_close-ups:tahir_j._naim	This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy	1
0471445770:this_book_is_lacking_:s._bischoff	I do not recomend this book because the author gives poor explanations. In chapter 5, he explains steady state error for unity feed back HORRIBLY. He says the value of c(t) must be infinite or nonzero, but doesnt bother to show why. This book needs more work making concepts clearer and making less assumptions.	0
532464	Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.	1
0070342075:the_examples_are_dated_but_great_background_material:david_b._horvath	As the name implies, this is about the elements of programming style. The examples are a bit dated (old languages, not C/C++/Java/the-next-great-language). But this isn't a *language* programming book, it is about how to write good programs in any language	1
0761131787:if_i_followed_this_i_would_feel_deprived:rachel	While I think the basics of the book are good, I don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option.  I did much better on the South Beach Diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.  Fat is what makes us feel satisfied.  After years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me I could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived.  An omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary.  Secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat.  I just noticed this week that Cool Whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients.  This can't be better for you than actual cream.  I also prefer the book "French Woman Don't Get Fat", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season.  The pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle.  I feel that the G.I Diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before.  I think this book is  about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated.  It certainly can help get people on the right track, but I think there are better books available.	0

But, he only has to worry about four particular, and sometimes peculiar, rooms. Each room is a story involving ted, directed by four different directors. Call it a collaboration of different comedic talents. So, let's go through them, one by one.	1
198023	"Splash" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie.	1

B0001WW2GC:not_so_sturdy_-_it_fell_apart:jb_from_california	This thing basically self destructed the first week.  The handle pieces wouldn't stay together and when I pushed down on the handle to tighten the pieces together the base fell apart.  Not worth the money!  I was very disappointed	0
B000J0T6Q0:a_little_bulky,_but_does_it_protects_the_phone:thomas	I recently purchased the black metal case for my 8525, and have had a few problems w/it.  First the belt clip is kind of small and broke when I tried to clip it to my belt.  Second the aluminum case isn't the sturdiest, so now it's sort of bent (referring to the hinge, I guess I've been really rough on my phone), but I just bend it back to where it's supposed to be (referring to the hinge).  But the case does what it's supposed to do...my phone looks and performs just as the day I got it.  When I informed the vendor that the belt clip broke I just wanted a new clip, instead I recieved a full refund, so that was a pleasant suprise.  I actually liked it so much I bought my wife one when she got her phone	1
B000069IL6:ms_works_7.0:	I had to upgrade to MS Works 7.0 due to Y2K issues. I am not nearly as satisfied with MS Wortks 7.0 as I was with MS Works 4.5. I am now searching for a replacement	0
B00069ZUYG:very_weak_vacuum.:hooty_kooter_"goob"	This sealer does not use a piston pump like most other sealers use.  It removes the air with a fan.  There is air left in the bag, it doesn't create a vacuum.  The bags are not ribbed and you have to fit them over a hose under the lid.  The bags are folded on a roll and you have to seal three sides to create a bag.  I was also dissappointed in the weight of the bags.  They are thinner than Ziploc bags.  You cannot use canisters with this one	0

B000GP5HP2:crazy_sick_pumps!:manuel_sanchez_"manny"	The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror. I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2 months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly recommended	1
B00062WIUC:i_love_the_alligator_on_the_lid:donald_campbell	Pre-seasoned would be easier but twice the price too.  To avoid a smoke filled house you can season on the grill but make sure you can control the temp, too much heat and you cook all the seasoning off.  As far as performance it does everything a big heavy pot is supposed to do.  The basket is funtional for deep frying but not steaming.  Nice piece of cookware	1
B0009UBSFC:simpler_is_better:sno	We have the Graco Ultra Clear monitor and it has worked really well for us for over 3 years.  With a new baby on the way, we thought we'd upgrade to the new technology.  Oops.  It turns out that the range on the new monitor was about half that of the Ultra Clear (couldn't even make it to the other side of the house), and the reception was quite poor.  And the annoying beeping was the clincher.  I sent it back today and bought another $40 Ultra Clear.  Oh, and I tried the Fisher Price Private Connection also, and had the same issues..	0

239219	So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!"  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.	1
B0009PRVGM:poor_merchandise:kevin_f._dolan_"yogi_k"	This towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low--one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric (like dust-bunnies) formed on it too.

B000FGJVF4:no_problems_on_an_imac:corrivo	I haven't had any problems using this DVD/CD burner over Firewire on a G4 iMac running Mac OSX Tiger. In fact, setting the drive up was easier than what was recommended in the manual; it was truly plug-and-play.	1
B0000AR6XD:not_good_for_lower_backs._:scmom	I bought this for my lower back. I am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time. It is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other.	0
B000002TW4:one_of_my_faves:e._karasik	Five stars may be excessive if you judge this CD alongside the greatest classics, but when compared to similar CDs within the singer-songwriter folk-rock genre, this beautifully simple and powerful collection really shines.  I find myself coming back to this CD more often than to many better-known classics because it has a freshness and originality that sustain interest.  The writing, while occasionally a bit awkward, is consistently interesting, honest and moving.  The themes of introspection, nostalgia,  regret, and defiance are presented in a searingly personal manner.  The song "If I Were a Man" is a rich celeration of the wonders women bring to relationships and the world; "Child of Steel" plucks the heartstrings with an achingly wistful delicacy; and "Take my Body" is a strong lament about the objectification of women.  I especially love the pared-down guitar arrangements; the simplicity really works with Ms. Cash's strong vocals and makes me wish some of my other favorite vocalists would occasionally just get back to basic guitar accompaniments.  I've seen Ms. Cash perform live and, while she has other hits that may be more popular, this collection reveals her unique brilliance	1
B000AANS7M:hilariously_funny_movie:terry_l._clark	I would recommend this Mel Brooks movie if you're in the mood to see slapstick comedy with many popular comedic faces.  You'll come away repeating some of the catch phrases and dialog.  I first saw it when it came out and still laugh when I see it.  Mel Brooks is a genius	1
B0006ABOAE:even_easier-_and_better-_than_i_thought:mlm	I wanted a dual coffee/espresso maker thinking I would mostly drink regular coffee with the occasional latte indulgence, but I was totally surprised how easy it is to use, and now it's lattes every day. Also, there was almost no learning curve-- my first cup (surprisingly, from what I've read elsewhere) was near perfect, and apparently it wasn't a fluke.	1
509842	I purchased this remote control to make watching DVD's on the PS2 easier.  I had problems getting it to work consistantly right out of the box.

B000FWAWVA:figures_don't_lie,_but_liars_figure:jason_tovey_"java_boy"	Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.

B00006408L:great_idea,_falls_short:	The idea of a nice warm wipe is great, but the product falls short in perfomance.  The warmer is designed for a non-popup type of wipe box. (If you use pop up wipes, just the part sticking out of the box gets warm, and the rest is cold.  If you use the other type of wipe box, it works ok as long as you always keep the wipe box full, which isn't always realistic for a moms and dads.  I am returning mine to the store.  :	0

391233	This has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor, without managing to be overwhelming.  I cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness, though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach.  That being said, whatever ends up getting you interested in this product, whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger, this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish, desk, etc.  My only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time, because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly	1

350834	From a pure image quality standpoint, this lens will not please the pixel peepers.  On the wide end of the zoom, which I personally use more often than the telephoto end, this lens is not very sharp, and it suffers from fairly bad distortion.  Worse than that, for me, are the chromatic abberations; this lens is quite prone to significant CA when shot at the wide end, which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness.  Given the price of this lens, one should expect a higher level of optical performance.	1

360310	This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date. Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear. The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use. Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light. They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price. I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	1
B0000TN7N8:no_good_:subu	i bought this humidifier reading the reviews here. but when i actually used for a few days, i found that it provided no relief from dryness while sleeping or during the day. it pretty much did nothing except make the room hotter. i would not recommend this to anyone	0
B00023CWP6:igniter_doesnt_fail_-_ss_box_does:thomas_rascon	I have had to replace the igniter twice in almost 15 years. The igniter was actually still quite good. It is very well made as are most Weber products. The stainless steel gas box is what eventually fails due to rusting (yep stainless steel will rust especially if subjected to heat).	1
B000BKGVYI:perfect_nano_case:larry_tate_"bymore"	With all the reviews about how easy the Nano scratches, I left the protective film on until I found the right case the next day at CC (they had just received them that day), sorry Amazon but the Nano did come from you.  Anyway the case is certainly up to the standard of the Nano itself.  It comes with a peel off protective strip that fits over the screen itself.  I have noticed the click wheel was a little slow to respond with the shipping film on it, but since when this case is open the click wheel is directly accessible, it works great.  It fits snugly in this case, yet is easy to remove though removal is not necessary to charge or update. The case has a felt inner lining which seems protect it and may provide some shock protection in case of falls. I have used it daily for 2 weeks with no scratches at all.  The belt clip is sturdy and secure.  The magnetic snap for closing it works great. The case can be closed with headphones attached, but of course to make adjustments it has to be opened which is easily done while on the belt clip as it unfolds to allow easy access. This case is as cool as the Nano itself and I would very highly recommend it. I hope Belkin makes the same case for the new IPOD	1
B0002AAMYC:these_pills_are_garbage!_pure_nonsense!:l._rowe	These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com.	0
559315	DVD newcomer "Fort Apache" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio.

B00008XET7:good_idea_canon_ole_bud:will_jacques	I bought a Canon Powershot A70. They say your best camera is the one you use most, and man I use it. I'm a high schooler, so I dont have much money, but with the A70, I can attach this adapter (LA-DC52C) to my camera, and I can have more photographic freedom with lenses, for alot less money. YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ADAPTER FIRST. Then any lense which fits (most), can be used... GOOD IDEA CANON!!!	1
0440225450:the_author_started_repeating_himself:fabiola_queiroz_"fabiola"	After reading all the author's books so far, i realized he is repeating himself. In all his books (including the ones which Myron Bolitar isn't present) there are the same elements in the plot: disappeared person who might or not be dead, mobster guys who might or not be involved in the plot, the hero gets beaten by mosbter guys and is always saved "in the last minute", someone wealthy and with lots has interest in the plot but no one knows for sure. As the plots became being built upon the same structure, the suprise is getting less and less after each book.  Being someone who started liking mistery books after reading all Agatha Christie's ones, and because each book of hers is completely diferent from the other, i look for the same originality in other mistery books.	0

Eveything just seemed ot come together and to me it just makes complete sense and I feel that this book is entirely true.   It would be great to see the world come together in world peace if they only knew the truth.  I knew the government covered stuff up but I had no idea to the extent they would goto to keep their undreground society such a secret and ruthless and would stop at nothing.  He doesn't say it straight out but the way it is described protrays this secret rogue group to be the illumnati with unlimited funding to carry out their evil intentions.  Greatest book I ever rea	1

B00097BYFY:warning:_do_not_buy!_terrible_video!:p._jackson_"miss_amazon"	This camera/Mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder is way to good to be true! I brought one because it was cute and looked perfect for mini movies. But I was sadly mistaken... This camera just takes cheap pictures and videos. The only thing that actully worked properly was the voice recorder that I had no need for. After about 3 days of trying to make it work a little better I gave up and sold it on eBay for the same price as I brought it for. It's a great idea... but it just isn't a good camera but if you want a voice recorder this is pretty nice. The Mp3 player isn't all that wonderful either. It doesn't work with iTunes. Or easy work with Windows. Hope this helps... I wish I would have read this before I brought this camera	0

B0007VDN6K:excellent_item_for_the_price_..:anupam_rastogi	This is a good collection of tools that you should have if you want to do minor watch repairs at home.  I had 5-6 watches lying around and I could not use them coz they ran out of battery.  Was able to open all of them with tools in this kit.  It doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how.  The quality of products is pretty good too .. at least nothing broke during fixing 5-6 watches yet.	1

580525	obviously, the music featured here is of high-quality.  hardly sign of the times transcendent, but nonetheless very exciting (as was typical of prince's 2002 tour).  unfortunately the director does his/her upmost to ruin everything for you with sub-bootleg grainy picture quality and warped sound, hamfisted camera angle switches, bizarre washed-out colors, some horribly cheesy effects and cuts.  for a band featuring nothing but incredibly dextrous musicians who play with an enormous level of detail and complexity, it's a shame the director clearly hasn't the faintest idea how to shoot a concert let alone one featuring musicians of this caliber.  hey prince, just so you know....your DIY "NPGMC" approach is only impressive if with it you can match what you'd been able to do had you still had the financial might of a major behind you.  if it looks this amateurish then you just look, well...amateurish.  and your talents are not worthy of anything even close to amateur-level presentation.  the bootleggers you despise so much put far greater care into the stuff they put out than you obviously could be bothered to do with this.   i mean really, you re-shot sign of the times in its entirety at paisley park after the rotterdam/antwerp footage was not up to par: i find it hard to believe that original footage was any worse than this.	0

577917	This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him	0

It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected more from Richard J. Foster	0

B000A3I4JQ:according_to_this_device,_i'm_dead.:portypal	As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79.  In the afternoon it was 188 over 155.  Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death.  At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78.  It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock.  I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon	0

You get the impression that you are getting a deal on this magazine, but you are not because you don't get the bonus CD-ROM.

The circle that is supposed to line up with the ipod's doesn't.  The plasic part covering the ipod is awkward and doesn't align either so you can't press the play button.  So, since the ipod doesn't fit in the case overall, this product is useless.  pls save your time and money and consider another ipod case	0
B00004CP3L:amusing,_clever,_a_bit_sad:c._o._deriemer	I much prefer irony to tragedy, and after Blue I was not sure what to look forward to with White. I wound up liking White a lot. Movies about "the human condition" are, for me, almost invariably obvious. While this movie does quite a bit of exploring about how a man reacts to love and the withdrawing of love, impotence and the power of performance, revenge and a circling back to love, I thought it was handled with such off-hand, dead-pan humor as to be a very sweet film. In a way, it struck me as an amuse-bouche, one of those unexpected treats that a first-rate chef will surprise a good customer with at the start of a meal or sometimes in between courses. The movie has that quality of freshness and unexpectedness.	1
1557255059:the_emperor_has_no_clothes?:play_fair	The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.	0

14536	I bought this gadget with the intent of monitoring my daily steps to get an idea of where I was currently to establish some sort of baseline so that I could get a reality check on my activity levels.  I opened the box, read the easy directions, set up my personal step measurement (just measure off the distance of your 10 steps), and clipped it on my pants and forgot about it for the day.  I was surprised to find out that a corpse could probably move around more during the day than me! Over the next 6 days, (this pedometer keeps track of 7 days of steps for you); I literally stepped up my game and went from 756 steps with NO aerobic exercise on day 1, to 7,880 steps with 30 minutes of nonstop aerobic exercise on day 3! Every day has been getting easier to achieve the 10,000 "normal" steps, and increasing the aerobic steps too (which are tracked separately). I can press the mode button, check out how many miles my steps translate to, kilocalories burned, aerobic steps, and compare it with the past 7 days as well. It has turned out to be even more fun than what I originally bought it for. I actually feel better, and the fun part is that I am trying to beat my own personal record from the previous day! This has been an eye-opening experience for me, and I keep this on or in my pocket all the time now, just to make sure I keep a mindful eye on my steps and aerobic activity for the day	1

None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big "thumbs down". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!	0

A couple of good, hard yanks by your child and this device fails. This might me a good product for infants and toddlers, but if your child is over 2 years old, try something else like the Lock Release Fridge Latch by Safety 1st (but be aware that even though these are by far superior, you'll still have to place about 3 of these Safety 1st latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them.

B000IZ78A2:fantastic!:amazonbie	I really like this protective cover.  It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend	1

One or two songs, like the Banana Splits, Speed Racer, and Scooby-Doo were fun. Most however, were harsh, and too fast for the parents and youngest guy.	0
7054	One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep. II's battle system is annoying and ponderous because "even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies." This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is "I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently."	1

0710309457:flowers,_colour_and_love:richard_hardiman	A wonderful wonderful book.Although the book was written some 150 year ago, Mary Eliza Rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in Palestine in the 1850's as if it was occurring today. She writes from her  heart with honesty,integrity and a clear mind. And although written at a  time of Victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or  judgement. From her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage  the Holy Land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and  change. For anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly  wonderful and personal experience to read this book	1

B0002C81BQ:beautiful_but_tough_to_work:teastaigh_"teastaigh"	Lovely jewelry, great price, but the clasp is pretty tough to work. This is not the necklace for anyone with stiff fingers. I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person	1

1558214046:stick_with_the_sociology,_leave_out_the_editorial:	From a sociological perspective, Hustlers, Beats , and others serves what it set out to do, explore the sociological aspects of billiards in America and the culture that has accompained it through time. However with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. Te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . Is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.As a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. All in all, quite disapointing as I found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting. I was left with a feeling of  disappointment when I finished this book, as it completely crushed many of  the idealization and ideologies and norms that are associated to theculture  of billiards. Stick with the sociology, cut the editoria	0

Please...anyone who had anything to do with this, don't continue in the film industry.  If it was possible to assign negative stars, I would do so for this awful experience.  Run away	0
B00006IU73:lots_of_variety!:crimzap	This music is undefinable ultimately. Oh yes, one can say parts sound like hard rock or progressive. One can say many things about it. For me, this, along with "Up the Downstairs" are probably their two best and they are both as different as night and day. I've become a collector of PT's stuff and like most of it very much indeed. Check out some of the side projects of the members in the band--like Blackfield and No-Man. They are worth good listenings too. But, you know, this wouldn't be a bad album to start your PT experience with. No, not at all	1

B0000X63JE:its_just_ok..._please_shop_around_for_something_else!!!!!:c._williams	Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs.	0
206298	This CD Is garbage. Juvenile should go hang him self after putting out this album. He was alright when he first came out but now he sucks the big one. If I was you dont listen to the retards who tell you "this is a good comeback album" . Instead of wasting you cah on this crap i recommend Welcome Back by Mase. That is a good comeback album. The only thing that makes the album even worth noting is the beats of Mannie Fresh. Juvenile just was a waste of those excellent beats. A shame they couldn't go to Ja rule, whose CD sucked with his beats. He has the vocal and writing talent but his beats blow	0

445712	"The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope	0

I suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings.  To end my agonies with the unit, I took it to the garbage dump.  The unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable.  When it worked, it worked well.  I believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito	0

Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it.

Several reviews have spoken about the  table splitting.  I ordered mine from my local hardware store and when I picked it up, I asked about finishing it.  The hardware folks (and this is a really good store) gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table.  Bottom line: take some time and finish this product.  Your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily.	1

Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?

B000B4SVME:love_this_highchair:marisa_tenaglia_"mltc01"	As most of the other reviewers, I live in a small townhome.  This chair is wonderful.  It takes up very little space and is so easy to clean.  I remove the straps and throw them in the wash and they come out so clean.  The rest of the chair is very easy to wipe clean and the tray just gets put in the dishwasher.  Despite carrots, prunes, etc. being mashed into it, the tray hasn't stained at all.  I recommend this chair to all my pregnant friends	1

I love the 5-star line & have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife. I'd recomend trying the 4-star & pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line(same blades, different handles). I'd definately replace if lost/stolen. After using proper tools there's no way you can go back to cheap knives. I'd love to see a 12" version of this knife w/a wider blade	1
B0007CQ6KO:a_little_shaky_but_necessary:rilezmum_"rilezmum"	I bought these extensions because I had to have them so that the co-sleeper would fit properly next to my bed.  However, when added the sleeper didn't seem as steady or stable on the floor.  There was a lot more sway in the sleeper with the extensions than without them.  While not a big issue because the sleeper was attached to my bed, I expected something a little more solid or sturdy.	1
B0000643Q6:best_watch_i've_ever_owned.:f.faulkner_"f.f."	The watch is extremely reliable. I've had it three years and it's never lost time and is running on the original battery. I wear it every day so it takes a lot of abuse. It's simple design is elegant enough for me to wear to work or out for a casual evening, but casual enough for me to wear on weekends. The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.  My Skagen is also easy to read the time. I just love it more than I can say. I own numerous watches, many from Switzerland. But the Skagen is the KING of my lifetime watch collection. Simplicity as its very BEST	1

B000BF0XWE:functional_and_value_for_money:mr._andrew_j._smith_"gringo_smeeth"	Due to my employment I travel extencively, this time piece has in the short time I have owned it forefilled all the requirements I require of a functional time piece at a very competetive price. I would recommend Pulsar as a manufacture to any body reqiring quality and style. At this moment in time I have 4 Pulsar time pieces that I use on a regular basis, 3 are working /daily use sports watches and I have a dress watch for when I am entertaining / partying. None of these watches have ever let me down, I have them regularly, serviced and new seals every time the batteries are changed, regular diving and swimming trips have never caused any problems. My one slight critisium would be the digital read out on this model is a little pale and could do with slightly altering the contrast, however it remains an excellent time piece - Highly recommende	1

I love the incline step...you can really feel the difference.  You can also increase the intensity or you can do it less intense as well. It gives you great variety with the height of the step, weights, incline, etc.  THIS IS AN AWESOME WORKOUT...I LOVE EVERY DVD!!  Very challenging and I'm am very happy I bought this.  The step is wonderful and very sturdy!  This is the only step you'll ever need...for all your Firm workouts!	1
B0007P4BGM:great_gift:sarah	My boyfriend got me this watch for Valentine's Day and it is gorgeous!  The face is very small as other reviewers have indicated, so if the recipient likes smaller face watches (as I do), this is a great gift.  It looks more like a bracelet than a watch; good for small wrists.  Elegant-looking & classy.  I love it!	1
6305772592:pointless:michael_butts	Eric Maibus and Scott Bairstow have become fine young actors, and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal, pointless, lurid and sadistic movie.  Dee Wallace Stone should be ashamed for participating.  Maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult, with no conscience, morals, or regard for anyone but himself; Bairstow plays the usual &quot;misunderstood&quot; teen who looks to the group for acceptance.  The script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence; enough is enough.  If this is the way teens talk, then steer me clear, folks.  There is no heart or soul in this movie, and no reason to rent or buy.  NO STARS.  C'MON AMAZON, WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE US THE 0 STARS OPTIONS??	0

161611	Do NOT buy this product.  It is incredibly slow, by far the slowest USB drive out of the dozen or so that I've used.  It handles small numbers of large files rather well but it immediately chokes whenever faced with a large quantity of small files.  I attempted to copy ~50MB (1500 files, 800 directories) to the disk and it took almost 30 minutes to complete the copy!  That's roughly 27K/second.  Deleting the files was painful as well, taking at least 15 minutes to delete everything.  For kicks, I popped in an old 128 MB Kingston drive and was able to copy the same set of files to it in under 30 seconds and the delete took under 15 seconds.  Bottom line is don't be fooled by the drive's small physical size, large capacity and price point: it simply doesn't perform	0

B000GSL1GS:cheap_quality_and_does_not_hold_large_watches_well.:bill_"bill"	The description states that it holds large watches.

One night I was flippin through the channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off. Sometimes that happens with "Digital Cable", but it usually it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering Morris.	0

Also, rice syrup won't give you the 'spike' and 'crash' of conventional sugar, and in fact supplies a steady stream of energy	1
323143	When Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Burroughs set out in their writing, they had no idea what it would create - a whole movement.  This film, including  interviews taken when Ginsberg and Burroughs were alive, assembles clips  from media, film, and personal account to show the beginnings of the beats  up to the passing-away of Ginsberg and Burroughs.  With a large assembly of  other beat writers and the poets they influenced (Carroll and Bukowski), it  is an extensive study to a misunderstood movement.  It is interesting to  see the Beat propaganda of the sixties, how negative and mocking the media  treated the sense of a &quot;cool&quot; movement; they painted a false  portrait.  This film is for lovers of Beat or people genuinely interested.   However, if you do not like documentaries, you won't like this one.  Also,  I was disappointed to see Depp, Hopper, and Turturro reciting long pieces  of work when the actual writers could have performed it.  Honestly, I  skipped these parts.  I wanted to see Ginsburg doing &quot;Howl.&quot;   Another disappointment is the DVD version, which was slapped together on  the fly.  I envisioned additional clips and useful information (let's face  it, you can put TONS on a DVD), but only had 2 or 3 screens of names  credited for making the movie and the trailer (in this case, not exciting).   However, with all disappointments aside, this film is good for a few  viewings.  It conveys a better picture of the Beats than other films have  before and enjoyed alot of the material	1

YOU'RE SUPPOSE TO SEE SOME HUGE CHANGES WITHIN A MONTH TO 45 DAYS, AND NOT ONE DAMN THING HAS HAPPENED!!!!!!!!!

B0006I8I28:hairy_problem:ben_g._baltes	These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair	1

245065	This book captures the human spirit, at both its best and its worst.  Schwarz-Bart is a masterful author in his telling of the tale of Ernie Levy, from birth and on.  He also, shows us the readers the cruelty of nature that was the Nazi movement.  It is unfortunate that so many people had to suffer so much through history as did the Jewish people.  It is one might say not a fair trade for normal life to be a Just Man, although without them humanity would crumble, as future readers will find out their importance.  And if there really are Just Men in our world...we really owe them a great deal of thanks for taking the pains of the world on their shoulders	1
B00009WCEJ:very_easy_to_use,_but_interference_bars_ruin_picture:	Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars.  One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA.  I am returning this product	0
B0000E0JDV:broke_within_weeks:joanna_purgason	We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept	0
B0007ZSN9S:chocolates_for_true_chocolate_connoisseurs:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	If it is possible to fall madly in love with a box of chocolates, then the assortment is the perfect place to start such an adventure. These chocolate are named after Leonidas Kestekidis, who definitely knew how to create chocolates for the true chocolate connoisseur.	1
B00017L1VY:if_movie_theatre_butter_is_what_you're_looking_for,_this_is_all_you_need.:a._hanson	This Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping is perfect if you're looking to make popcorn that tastes like what you get at the movie theatre.  It is a very large bottle, however, so you better like popcorn a lot if you're thinking about purchasing this product.	1
B00097DFRE:the_best_invention_since_a_blow-dryer!:shannon	These are the coolest things ever made. I have been searching for a product like this forever and I could only find what used to be called &quot;lingerie helpers&quot; from the 50's or 60's (I think) which didn't quite do the job.  No more buying those &quot;speciality&quot; bras that cost a bundle or those racerbacks that didn't quite fit right. I just put these on my favorite bra and don't even know it is there.  Now there is no excuse for me to ever see anyones bright pink bra straps peeking out from their shirts. I am just jealous that the woman who invented it is going to make millions and I am not!!!	1
B000EDUV2A:worst_product:jorge_ramirez_"pirana316"	I bought one outside Amazon, and charged it 15 hours.  My mini Maglite had more power. The battery never worked. Don't waste your money. Better pay a little more, but for something that works	0
B000BNGI5C:in_stock?_not_true!:b._french	Don't expect to receive this by Christmas even though it says "in stock". I ordered this on Dec. 14th and just received word today, the 20th, that it is not expected to ship until the end of January, early February. So if you need it for a specific occasion, don't count on it getting there in time	1
548441	Great concept, but bad design. Both of my children have had one for a year. Due to the discomfort, they never use it! It needs to recline back further and the plastic is slippery making it hard to sit without slipping around	0
B0009I8KUK:ok..but_not_great:g._adams	While I like the functions this offers, the screen is a bit hard to read when riding.  Also, the instructions aren't very easy to follow.  For example, it is displaying in kilometers per hour but the instructions don't say how to convert to miles/hour. I would probably not buy this again	0

267000	VCI's budget DVD starts out well enough for the obscure thriller Lady Ice, with nice letterboxed credits foreshadowing interesting widescreen photography to come. Unfortunately, as soon as the credits end, the aspect ratio changes to full screen and the rest of the film is presented in one of the worst pan and scan jobs I've ever seen on DVD. Pass on this one from VCI, and hopefully down the line there will be a new widescreen transfer so we can see how the film is supposed to look after the credits.	0
362281	MechAssault is a great game for anyone who wants to be able to  destroy everything in his path, and school armys with one huge battle machine. Destroying other Mechs and tanks as well. But when you finish the main game and have all of the mechs, then you would throw it aside not play it again? No. Not if you have Xbox Live. In Live you can play Capture The Flag, download new Mechs, and play with hundreds of players just like you, and you will always come back for more. If you don't have Xbox Live or a system link, that your wasting your money.	1
585067	I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed!	0
B000E0OFCK:fascinating_listen:idiot_standing_in_a_hurricane_"kate"	I felt compelled to write a review having read another written by someone who gave it one out of five stars.  I felt it a grossly misleading and inaccurate review, so here I am...	1
315734	All the great reviews written previously say it all - Anne of Green Gables the movie is a timeless classic of the classic novel. I've been watching this movie since I've been a child, and I still watch it as an adult. A movie like this doesn't need "special features" for it to be attractive as a DVD(Although the commentary is great!). Just the fact that no matter how long I keep this and how often I watch this movie, it won't change like VHS does.	1
B000075SNH:hilarious_comedy_for_"middle_ages":m._swieczkowski_"comedy_lover"	This movie is perfect for people in their 40ies and/or 50ies. It just hits the bullseye. Lean back and enjoy the ride	1
B00021HBGS:cute_tub_toys...no_complaints...:t._byler	These are really cute and a great alternative to the standard "Numbers and Letters" version of these foam tub toys. My 2 and 3-year old sons enjoy playing with them. No complaints here	1
B000HE7M3M:excellent_product!:t._klempay	INport, excellent job, I love the product and would highly recommend it to anyone.  I've had several hundred LPs sitting in boxes in the basement for years and now I'm rediscovering that music all over again as I transfer the LPs to the digital age.	1
B000FGEE7E:you_get_what_you_pay_for:anslevelz_"gadget_gizmo"	The watch winder is very quiet and inexpensive.  However, the quality is suspect - one side stopped rotating after a week.  You probably get what you pay for. Too much hassle and does not make economic sense to ship back and incur international shipping charges	0
B000BAT2TE:junk!:bill_hansen_"bill"	Don't waste your time and money!! EXTREMELY poor product support! 60 day return policy which they exploit by trying to solve your problems and delaying past the 60 day limit, then you're stuck with worthless software.	0
B00091PP8M:good_deal:dana	This purchase came with 3 stackable racks - I thought it was only one rack. It stores very easily in a compact space and works well. I don't know if it rusts since I have only wiped the tray with a cloth after using it	1
6304437242:sir_gielgud_steals_the_show.:oldzapatos	As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball "My Man Godfrey" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies.	1
B0007Q3K72:very_nice_hydration_pack!:m._leach_"mike"	One thing I really like is that there was no plastic or rubber taste on the first use.  It holds enough for long bike ride and was cold all the way to the end of the ride.  It feels good on your back too.  It helps in this Florida heat.	1

B000225ZVA:isn't_it_romantic?:joanna_daneman	If you love roses, this is a romantic bath luxury, with seven rose buds for your bathing delight. For a candlelit bath with romance, let it dissolve unencumbered. For scent but no mess, put it in a mesh bag first, because little flower bits will be all over the tub. At least it has no glitter. The scent is not particularly strong, but it is full of a natural rose scent that smells wonderful	1
B000227PLS:excellent_design:p._hong	I bought this bag as a replacement for another roller bag for my 17" laptop and was surprised at how compact the design is and how weight conscious it is.  The storage capacity and location for such things as chargers and cords in the space where the roller frame is makes this thinner than my previous bag.  I also appreciate the smaller zippered pocket on top for things like plane tickets and things that you need quick access to.  As an engineer, I must say the design is well worth the price and certainly is a practical way to carry a larger laptop	1
B0000VJG6S:out_of_time:shakespear	If you like Denzel Washington, I think this is one of his best movies yet.  He is sexy, and so is his co-stars.  The movie delivers great action, suspense and surprises at the end.	1
B0007O25UC:wonderful!:s._kosack	I have no idea how our parents had us with out these!  They are the best invention!  My son likes to play with plates, so I can feed him anything he wants on the table directly with out worrying about what else he may be eating.  I have a toddler and a 9 mo old.  NEITHER of them have been able to remove these things.  And beleive me, they've tried.  So I dont know what that other review was talking about.  They're inexpensive, easy to use, and clean.	1
B0001XDOYK:useless!:renee_jacobs_"momto2sweeties"	The monitor was terrible!  It would only pick up our baby's voice when she was screaming.  It had a metallic sound to it and the different volume settings did not seem to make any difference.  It is going back to the store and I am looking for something else.  I wish I would have checked ratings first!  Choose something else	0
B00030EPJE:great_playhouse!:lucienne_poff_"suuuki"	Based on the other reviews, this grandmother decided to buy this particular playhouse for my grandson's first birthday present! I am not the least bit disappointed. Colorful, action packed activities everywhere, sturdy, easy to assemble, cold weather friendly and perfect for the little boys in your life! There are a lot of girlie playhouses, but this one is the answer for boys.	1
B000N8OFIW:easy-to-use_digital_technology:amy_j_"amy_j"	Better than a photo album for showing off a series of pictures.

B0006ZHMXM:nothing_to_write_home_about_!:james_mullen_white_iv_"james_white_'flatpick_lover"	The Jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish. After one hour of use the Jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. So don't say you weren't warned.	0
B00081RT5A:disappointed!:new_grandmom	I was happy to see this type of product available, but was not happy when I received it.  It seems like a flimsy piece of plastic, and the "magnets" looked like they were painted on, a gold-tone, and the paint looked like it was chipping off.  The base of the item is separate from the top of the item, which seems to be attached with springs?  It did run, but was very loud, like it was working too hard.  There is a note not to use it more than 20 minutes, which I'm not sure is because of a potential adverse affect with the user, or because the unit might overheat.  There were some spelling errors on the outside of the box (a few places said "reflexology" and a few places said "relexology")-- but maybe that just bothers me?  I think it is also important to note that the buyer pays shipping, and if returned -- also pays RETURN shipping charges; and when combined, nearly equals the original cost of the item.  ;o(	0

6303082742:garbage:hitechkoolaid	Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining	0
6304989210:good_movie:	There are tons of women in prison films out there.  There are so many that often times they seem almost repetitive.  However, this film was very unique because it provided a great mix of comedy and action.  Pam Grier as  a tough revolutionary provided all the action as she ploted to free the  mistreated women from prison.  The comedy mostly came from the sexually  deprived women, who were full of one-liners and crazy notions.  But of  course the movie still contained all the things that make a good prison  explotation film....lots of nudity...violence...bad laguage and did I  mention lots of nudity. It's worth seeing!  If you like it also check out  THE BIG DOLL HOUSE	1

B0000Y3FB2:a_ripoff!:k._schillinger_"radiowire"	It only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is NOT the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. Using this "extractor" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. Those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation	0

Some folks might be hesistant to spend over $100 for a radio ... trust me - it is well worth it.  My girlfriend's parents have had an older version of this radio for over 30 years - still sounds great	1
B0001MQHZY:grill_pad:albert_morgan	This item is not as functional as I thought.  I miscalculated the size which is not big enough for my purpose.  Also, the brittle like surface is cracking and peeling off. I was going to exchange or return the item but the packaging was discarded too soon	0
B000G7P5FM:incredible_bites_of_goodness!:midmigurl	I love these chips...they have a taste that gets better the more you chew them and they give you plenty of fiber and soy protein.  I wish they weren't as high in fat as they are, but they're good for a once in awhile indulgence	1
B00011SLTA:victorinox_swiss_army_knives_in_general:james_m._sittnick_"cutler,_cutlery_dealer"	They are made so well, operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package.  The other review about them just doesn't hold water.  You can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem.  The keyring has to be on one end or the other,  but it is really not a hindrance	1
255568	Ladies Home Journal has several features that readers will like. One of the most popular is "Can This Marriage Be Saved" featuring a couple that is having marital problems presenting both their sides and then a counselor's advise. Other columns include "How They Met", "Animal Affairs", and "Raising a Family". Each month there is an article featuring a family that acquired a house through Habitat. A nice feature is a column presenting a man's perspective called "Heart of a Husband". There are also articles on beauty, health, travel, and parenting. There are plenty of recipes and craft and decorating ideas. Each issue also includes a couple of celebrity interviews.	1
527015	No, this game isn't perfect - you'll be annoyed by the dialogue (luckily you can fast forward through it) and the cut scenes (unfortunately you CAN'T fast forward through those).  BUT it's filled with tons of things to solve, and if you get stuck, you can have the game solve it for you.  This game will keep you busy for a while...but fair warning, it's CORNY	1
B000EUJJNK:zax_mixing_bowl_set:k._caldwell	I received my bowls today and was very disappointed.  How bowls this size can be referred to as "mixing" bowls I cannot fathom.  Neither do I know what could be mixed in bowls so small.  The second from the largest bowl is about the size of a normal cereal bowl. The bowls nest so the largest bowl holds the "cereal" bowl and the next to the smallest bowl nests in the cereal bowl.  The smallest bowl is a joke.  I doubt it would hold an extra large egg without running over.  The material is nice...melamine... and colorful but those are the only positive statements I can make	0

B000B8NFHQ:quickbooks_premier_2006_is_easy_but_powerful:charles_p._vigeant	I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.

I used to be very organized (and still am at work), but with the birth of my daughter almost a year and a half ago that has all gone down hill around the house.  I came away with some really good tips for organization.  Not to mention some good tips on how to get rid of ants and various other insects and rodents.  Great book for any mom who feels their house needs a little boost in the organization department	1
B00029KOVO:a_strange_mix_of_relaxing_and_invigorating.:s._c._watson	The scent of this tea brewing is a real wake-me-up.  Cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and orange peel are some of the very redolant flavors.  The cinnamon is so strong that it gives a slight burning  feeling in the mouth--one of my favorite things about this tea.  I'm not a huge tea drinker, but I really enjoy this in winter.  It's great for mulling things as well--apples, pears, and wine.  My only complaint is that it is not 100% reliant on chopped ingredients and there are some flavors added.  But it's still incredibly good and nice for a thoughtful morning or evening.  Makes me miss Seattle, WA and Pike Place Market	1
217503	John Michael Mongomery is back with a big bang.  This album is one of the best to come out this year. It's better than that of Travis Tritt, Alan Jackson, and Kenny Chesney.  The song I wanna be there is one of the most touching songs since Alan's Where Were you.  He mixes the soulful ballads, with his country rockers, and sweet love songs.  THis is vinatage JMM and should be bought by any true country music fan	1

B00005BUZB:your_child's_safety_isn't_worth_saving_a_few_dollars:stephanie_mooney_"reednowensmommy"	We purchased 2 of these seats to give to the grandparents for when my son came to visit them. Right out of the box, the seat pad wouldn't stay on the seat and slides around during use. I figured I could live with that since it was just a cheap seat anyway.

B00032ORCC:best_acne_gel:l._feldman	I have tried many different products and this one is the best. I rely on it for many years already and it always works faster than anything else I have tried. Four Stars because it leaves a thin barely but visible film on the skin where you apply it. You can gently blend it with a facial brush after it dries so then its no problem. Especially if under makeup	1

B0007KQWGE:aggravating:caj_"caj280"	This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works.  It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works.  The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink.  I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time.  Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap.  I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine.  This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!!	0

67543	I say almost due to the fact that Aperture gives them a good run for the money. You know those photography magazines with about 10 pages of pictures and articles and the rest is advertising? This is not it! If you enjoy a magazine that delivers informative photographing techniques, get this one! If you are interested in seeing the work of other photographer's, get this magazine! If you want a hot collectible, GET THIS MAGAZINE!!! Yes there are ads in here, but not a ton of them. For you guys (and girls) out there who love to see the occasional beautiful star photographed, get this magazine. One of the aspects of this magazine that I like, is the fact that the photo layouts are sometimes full page, unlike some magazines where you have to get out a magnifying glass to view the photos. And this one IS a hot collectible, though the French version of it is an even hotter collectible. Whether it's nature,  special effects, or provocative photography, this one is a superb magazine. In short, this one is a must get for the photography fan	1
B000245WCU:so-so_for_some_things,_completely_unacceptable_for_others:ronald_king	If you're just mixing non-gas-forming drink mixes, this thing works acceptably well, but if you're mixing something like "Ionic Fizz" magnesium drink that fizzes up a bit, it's not very useful because it just doesn't form a very good seal, no matter how tightly you close it. As another reviewer mentioned, it's very easy to cross-thread the lid.  Thicker threads and deeper threads would probably help.	0
B000LPXYRU:almost_$20.00_and_another_sleepless_night_later...........:p._guard-younce_"sleepless_in_st._charles"	Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money	0

B000B0MYV2:nice_watch-great_price:k._mcdaniel	I purchased this watch on Amazon after looking at the same watch in JC Penny and Dillards for almost $200.00 more. It's a nice casual watch, I wear mine to work as a nurse and its very durable and attractive. The mother of pearl face is a pale pink so it doesn't clash when wearing other colors. For the price, Seiko watches are great, mine usually last about 10 years of frequent wear getting wet regularly.	1
B000AX22ZI:the_eyes_and_nose_are_not_asian...:tikallover	While the doll is beautiful, I don't think she is a good representation of Chinese people because if you look at the picture of a close up of her face, you can see that her eyes are big and round just like a European. Her nose also is upturned.	0

B00021RFY6:poor_engineered_coffee_grinder:r._goehle_"angry_coffee_man"	Makes good coffee but grinder lid breaks very often and has to be replaced. Since the lid is costly to replaced we bought a separate Krups grinder. Cusinart does't answer e-mails about the problem. Look at the number of recondition makers for sale and draw your own conclusions	0
B00001R3G0:nice...but....:marcs	I prefer the live versions of these pieces. Its nice to get more material from that period but you can hear the strain that was going on at the time of this final album by this line-up. I was at the concert for live record and think that they (the pieces that are on this CD) really come alive when being performed live	1
0786282975:small_steps:	If you want to read a book that's exciting, happy, and mind-blowing you should read Small Steps. From the author that brought you Holes, Louis Sachar, is at his best. This book is sort like a sequel to Holes. The main character, Armpit, is stuck in a situation which he can not handle. He is in the heat in Austin, Texas and I think it is making him do crazy illegal things. At first he did not know what he was doing was wrong, but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail. I think that this book is good for any reader 11 and above. Both boys and girls would enjoy this book. I think they should make a movie out of the book; it would get outstanding remarks. This is one out of few books that I could read over and over again.	1
B000BM8RT8:why_there's_no_cig_lighter_adapter:catherine_harmon_"95_4runner"	This little machine is capable of pulling so much current, that it would blow most fuses for Cigarette lighters, which is why the adapter isn't included. It needs to be clipped directly to the battery, and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes.	1
B000199YRU:just_doesen't_hold_up:loose_cannon_"raconteur"	I have had three of these during my two year contract, I am trying to baby the last one enough until the end of the two years.  Each has had the problem of powering down and re-booting without warning.  The are billed as "Mil-spec" this or that, but unless you keep it inside a purse, get ready for many trips to the Sprint store.  Motorola used to be THE name in communications, but after this and my friend's problems with the Razr's, I'm headed to Nokia	0

6302560012:amahl_revisited:ernest_ragogini_"eragogini"	It is unfortunate that the only video presentation of Amahl is so generously flawed in stagecraft and sound production. It is not necessary to enumerate specifics here since some were cited in Ms. Lynch's review. True, Ms. Stratas' voice was often subjugated by the orchestra, but there were also  moments when her diction was less than perfect, during times which the orchestra had, gratefully, been relegated to a less prominent decibel level.  Here, sound production staff  must share blame.  Menotti knew what he was writing. A brilliant orchestrator, he etched clearly, the differences between orchestral dialogue and accompaniment figures. Staging, at times, appears to have little to do with the music. When one thinks of Menotti and opera (almost synonymous), the marriage of music AND theatre is considered a perfect union. Sadly, Menotti's obvious musical intentions were overlooked. It is heartening to read that a new video of this opera may be produced. I would disagree with Ms. Lynch that it is a good introduction to this operatic work. The beginning, the introduction makes the strongest impression.  It is lasting.  This is one indelibility I would not welcome	0

B0009UBSFC:look_elsewhere...:j._dolata	I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain:	0
B000066PGS:better_to_pay_for_the_name_brand_this_time:m._carstens_"m.c.b."	These batteries last a long time. Cheaper batteries won't hold a charge after repeated use/charging. I have AA Energizer batteries and after a year they still hold a charge with out any problems.	1
B000CE9IAM:turbotax_made_my_day:lori_smart_"amazon_queen"	I've been using TurboTax since 1999. We run two small companies and my background is in accounting. Hence, I have a VERY hard time giving someone else my bookkeeping and taxes to do, since I really have a hard time letting go of the control! (I've really got to get over that!!) Each year, it seems that TurboTax does nothing but improve! I typically delay until the last minute and cram it all in on April 14, and if it wasn't for the simplicity fo this software, I'd be filing extentions every year. Really, gathering all your stuff together is the hardest part. This software does everything else for you.	1

209060	I couldn't believe what a hard time I had trying to find a small, hardback, unlined notebook with book-like binding! I'll admit that I bought this product because it was the only one I could find that fulfilled these requirements. But I am extremely pleased with the overall quality of this notebook. I am using it to record my favorite quotes and it is perfect for that purpose thus far. The only downfalls I can say may stem from the fact that I am writing in it with a fountain pen. The ink tends to "vein out" a bit if you will and I can't write on both sides of the paper because the ink is too dark. Otherwise I love the appearance of both the cover and the paper. I can't speak for how it handles for sketching. I also like the small pocket on the inside of the back cover. With shipping it is a bit pricey, but definitely a great product	1
B0006U67GK:massage_table:g._bouchard_"pinab"	Excellent product.  Great for home use as it folds up and slides right under the bed.  The height is adjustable and it breaks down and stores quickly. Very good quality materials for the price.  I have had my eye on one in the in-flight magazine when I travel but I saved a lot of money buying it here especially since they included free shipping	1
B0001WKG06:correct_mix_of_french_herbs:roddey_reid	Besides being a very good deal for the price, this item thankfully does not contain lavender, which is not commonly used in French cuisine but is used rather to freshen clothes chests. However, the classic mix of herbes de Provence for cooking usually contains one additional herb: marjoram	1
B0000041VV:wonderful_christmas_cd:jordan_t.	Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD	1
519089	This game is a joke!  It is immpossible for a child to get past level 3.  It took my husband about 20 tries to get past it, and he is a pro at video games.  (he beat mech 2 for x-box and halo2 the third time he played them.)  Don't buy this game for your kids until you rent it and let them try it out.  It is was a waste of money my kids won't even play it.  It should be rated N for Nobody	0

B00008W71M:narrow_fit:	While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow.  Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not.  I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	0
B00000IUX6:great_for_dogs_too!!!!!:murphy	My 2.5 year old Border Collie just loves the tunnel and we train with it a few times per week.  Since the agility tunnels for dogs are a bit pricey, I decided to try this more affordable kid's tunnel instead. It's not as heavy and robust as the official agility tunnels, but it has been serving me great for just about a year - there's just some minor wearing around the rings and small toe nail runs in it - but it's still very usable.	1
B0001WAYZS:great_product_at_super_low_price:s._kochel_"sam_k"	I can't not imagine having a great machete, and it's easy for me to imagine many things I would want one for. This one is cheap, not very big, and of good-enough quality and the kukri style is great for cutting brush, chopping, and would be fine of fighting too, if you had too. Truly, unless you have more money you want to spend on a machete, or really don't need one because you never leave your house out of fear and don't play Jumanji or perhaps you have no arms...this machete is for you!	1

B00077AA7O:absolutely_stunning_clock!:c._larche	This is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it's hung on the wall. The fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home. The atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed. I put the battery in it and that's it. It took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time, but it's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception  . I highly recommend this clock. It is more than I expected	1

B000HC0BJG:good_features,_but_for_one_serious_flaw_...:d._pinelle_"home_theater_enthusiast"	I bought this receiver to use as a preamp in my system.  I based my decision on information as stated on the Pioneer web site, and the attractive price compared to some of the other options I considered.	0
151510	This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.	0

558860	They just don't have movies like this anymore.  This is not a movie that makes Charlie Sheen or Tom Berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen.  This is amovie to show you the reality of war and experiences that happened to people in the past.	1
B0000C9ZBW:awesome_and_stylish:murali	Everyone loves this watch.  I wear it for work, and it's sleek enough to look sharp.  Women constantly compliment me on how it looks.	1
B000FPWEF4:if_i_could_give_zero_stars_it_would_be_more_appropriate:d._gerzon	After researching a few options on the market I tried Kaspersky Internet Security Suite 6.0. I needed only anti-virus but since the rebates made the whole suite cost the same as anti-virus alone I decided to give it a try. Man, I was really disappointed. Out of 7 programs only 2 started and have been working properly: anti-virus and proactive defense. The suite was trying to start other 5 programs and was requesting to reboot laptop constantly. After trying all I could I decided to call or email for help. And this is where I got my surprise - none of the contact information led me to any LIVE person. I emailed to all addresses available on the net and in the program. I called all US numbers I could - they even don't have a live representative here. If you try to call a number for US and Canada you will reach one of those accept all calls and leave your numbers with wait all you can for response time. I filled out two bug reports directly from the program with the same result.	0
349795	Valkyrie Profile is a cult classic.  No matter how you look at it.  It was one of those games you either loved or hated.  Obviously enough people loved it enough for Square-Enix to re-release the original on the PSP and make a second one on the Playstation 2.  The end result is a great game that should satisfy fans of the original.	1

B000J38WXU:heat_sox_do_not_work:lisa_b._"goodshopper"	I never write reviews, but I had to make my comments on these socks. I bought them to keep my feet warm at me desk at work.  I put them on and turned the switch to high.  They DO NOT EVEN GET WARM at all...I thought it was broken, but realized it was both socks that didn't get warm. These are a total rip off and I am going to try and send them back.	0
49371	Mcmurtrys new album really disappoints.  I am a longtime fan and found the subject matter of the new album slipping out of character with James past work (as well as somewhat inappropriate and overly cynical).  While Mcmurtry has had past hits that either hearken back to childhood extravaganza (See the Elephant) or that provide an echo to the way we Americans spend our time (Holiday), his attempts on Childish things came across as an unfortunate mix of trite and depressing.  In past attempts Mcmurtry was able to find the nuances of the positive and the negative of Americana, yet all the remains in the stinging lyrics of this album is the over-used and overheard downside. The thoughtfulness evaporated on this work.	0
B00006LCVJ:way_too_kiddy:shanti_r._"effervescent_adolescent"	I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!! There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens	0

B00000F7RW:enough:owen_wilson_"owen"	I thought this was an excellent movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I just couldn't stop watching it. It has an excellent plot that I think a lot of people can understand. It gives you an idea of what goes on when a husband becomes violent with his wife and starts to abuse her	1
504345	I just read Dirk's "spolier" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh?  Demonic, fallen angles? What?  Did we watch the same movie?  If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area  was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear.	1

B0002234XQ:well_all_right:alain_robert	While it is certainly fun to watch just to see the performers,this HISTORY OF ROCK simply doesn't jell as a whole.By trying to explain the evolution of the music,the pleasure gets lost along the way.If you are a rock connaisseur,you won't learn many new things if you watch this.What you should do is take it as a starter point and then go further with documents who gets deeper with one particular field(ex:MOTOWN or BRITISH INVASION).As it is,it tries to cover too much ground at once and still manages to forget a few artists like EMERSON,LAKE AND PALMER and KING CRIMSON among others.It costs me $80 dollars (CANADIAN money)for this 5 dvd set, which is too much for what it's worth.Rent it and enjoy the clips	1
B000KI32Q6:works_great:j._dehning	Works great, keeps me from spilling on myself, especially when I have ice in there. Doesn't slip, fits just right. Easy to get in and out. The bottle top screws right over it.  I can toss it in the silverware spot in my dishwasher to wash.	1
B000086150:4_months_and_waiting:"cstelzer3"	I ordered this product June 21st and am now told i should receive it by Oct 28th.   I wouldn't waste my time ordering this product from Amazon	0
B000BYCC1K:ok,_but_not_all_that_it_was_cracked_up_to_be:amanda_maishman	the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new "channel" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one	0
B000H28RZG:don't_use_with_ms_office_2007:j._d._ray	I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.	0

B00004CJB5:brooding_portrayal_of_heroine_in_bronte's_book:janice_harrison_"janice"	I have the VHS tape of JANE EYRE, starring Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles. Felt both characters were well-cast, with the quiet and sensitive Fontaine as Jane Eyre, and the brooding, inscrutable Orson Welles as her employer, Mr. Edward Rochester. The black-and-white movie is more suitable for this genre, in my opinion, than the color version, as it depicts more accurately the brooding and eerie qualities of Thornfield Hall, the Rochester residence where his mad wife (of whom Jane knows nothing) is shut up in one of the towers in an unused part of the house with her "keeper" Grace Poole.  I felt the acting as well as the cinematic quality of this movie accurately reflect the atmosphere that Charlotte Bronte was trying to portray in her novel.	1
B000GB0O0O:a_total_bust:jennifer_duncan	The volume control on this is totally lame.  I can't get it quite enough to put on the crib for bedtime.  Also, the sound quality is poor in general.  I suppose it's OK for just playing in the room, but definitely not for bed.  You can probably get something with better sound quality for a comprable price	0
B000068CO7:get_something_else:aggie_angst	I worked hard on a VCD project for work using Photo Explosion. I didn't think it was that easy to use, but it was okay until I got ready to burn.  Got a little error message that said something along the lines of "You don't have Nero burners!" No kidding, but there are four other burn programs on my computer. Nothing but Nero would do.  NOWHERE on the box are you informed of this.  It says, and I quote, "Burn CD slideshows you can watch on tv!" Needing more software is never mentioned. As far as I'm concerned, this product makes fraudulent claims.  I will never buy another one of their products	0

B0000VYDJS:can't_do_without_mine:teresa_blinkenberg_"4boys4mom"	I love this clock.  I won it as an incentive through my Creative Memories sales.  I love that it is always set to the accurate time.

B0009XH6ZA:well_worth_the_price:richard_park_"rick_in_la"	I bought this model 7 years ago for over $100 and it is still running strong although I only use it to clip a small family dog.  Nevertheless, forget the cheap vibrating 'magnetic motor' clippers - not enough power and the buzzing bothers the animal.  This clipper uses a superior rotating motor that is more powerful and provides a consistent cutting action.  In fact, with the right (replaceable) blade, you could use this to cut kids hair as well.  It stays cool, unlike the magnetic motor design.  Use with Oster Kool Lube and you  will never have problems getting a clean cut.  It uses blades by Oster so there is a lot of versatility possible	1
B000056JND:great_bottle:kirsten	I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily	1

B000GOYZKG:horrid_film:j._d._meckel_"bassman720"	This is still to this day one of the most aweful films i ever saw. I took a girl ona  date for this movie and wow, what a mistake. The movie has no real plot and just gets worse as you watch it more.	0
B00006W2U0:i_was_duped!!!!!!:candi_mcdaniel_"classic_movie_lover"	I think they should place a disclaimer at the top advising would be buyers that Rosemary Clooney does not perform on this CD.

B000JIH7NG:sweet:	I am the leader of a team called POINT 0 I got this gun about a week ago it rocks my socks. It shoots about 300fps or maybe a little more. The scope is ok and the laser pointing thing isnt to hot but it gives you an estamite at night. It holds 21 pellets and doesnt go out very fast the cocking thing is at the top. But do not use this in a war with automatics you wont compare unless your sniping. I am the leader of point 0 and this gun rocks	1
B000LVE9IC:misleading_description:vgeek	I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.	0

B0009VK9TW:great_water_-_lousy_fit:cheerytoes	I've changed out shower heads all by my little lonesome uncountable times over the years. I cannot get this attached without it leaking at the connection to the pipe and what appears to be a leak where the housing screws on on the unit itself. That said, I still have reasonable water pressure and here's the amazing thing, my relatively coarse hair is no longer coarse without putting any number of silicone products on it. Who knew that for all my life, it was the water, not my hair. My skin is not as dried out...if I could work out the little glitches, it would be perfect. I own the counter top unit in the kitchen and it's fab for the price!	1

B000MKHQG4:wonderful!!!!:c._a._pronovost	We tried littermaid and still use it in our motor home, but we absolutly LOVE the cat genie for our 2 spoiled and large cats. We would not only buy it again, we're getting one for my sister for her birthday, and recomending it to everyone we know with cats. We've been using it for the past 5 months and it has clogged twice. [an easy clean-up and fix]  Much less hassle than the litter maid and no smell or dealing with overflowing cartridges. [ or my DH's attempts to 'modify' the littermaid so it will hold more, or use bags or boxes, etc... which never work and make a smelly MESS!!] Every now and then the 'soap box' will jiggle loose and might need a tap to re-seat it, but you get a beep to warn you.	1

The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot	0

B0000UM0P8:makes_me_laugh_when_i_see_the_box!:joshua_glowzinski_"gman"	I will make this short.  Aykroyd, Candy two men who are hilarious together is of course hilarious.  The story is about a man who loves his family and is a middle class man going on vaction.  His relatives decide to join him without letting him know.  The relatives are totally diffren't from the family they join and seeing them mingle is a riot.  I say get this movie because everyone I know who has seen it all say the same thing  "I love that movie, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.	1
333719	I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.	0

B0006G0KR6:good_blades,_nice_feel:j._shinn	I was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price.

B0001ZWWSM:excellent_skin_care_product_for_your_eye_area:cinephiliac	When I was a little girl, I would watch my Mother take her makeup off at her dressing table.  Cold cream and soft cloth tissues.  A gentle misting of water and then another dabbing with cloth.  Then night cream, eye cream ("dab on gently, never rub"), a special lotion for her throat and collarbone area.  She would impart her beauty secrets to me while I sat transfixed.  Although I was convinced that she was the most beautiful woman in the world, I was surprised that with all these lotions and oils, she didn't' slide right out of bed at night.  "Exercise, Sweetheart.  Drink lots of water.  Never go to sleep in your makeup--no matter how tired you are.  Never wash your face with regular soap.  Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize.  Your skin has to last you a lifetime and nothing gives away a woman's age like uncared for skin."  While I am not sure where I would even find 'cold cream' today, I follow the vast majority of her regimen.  The two items that I use for under my eyes are Avon's Repair Eye Serum and Hydrofirming Bio6 Eye Cream.  The cream plumps up and firms the delicate tissue around the eye, and the serum smoothes and moisturizes the skin.	1
B0006ITPOS:sherwood_rd-6500_surround_sound_receiver:john_l._macarthur	I needed a replacement Receiver for a fairly modest home theater system. I wanted a bare bones 5.1 system (no 6.1, 7.1, 1kw audio power, satellite radio capable, etc.)  I only use the Receiver as an audio switch and let the TV handle video source selection.  Reviewers of the Sherwood RD-6500 liked the audio but thought the set-up a little confusing.  Being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me.  The price was certainly right, about the cheapest thing around (at [...]).  I bought the unit and have been completely satisfied.  I would have given it five stars but heck, nobody's perfect.  I had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality (full disclosure:  my ears are 79 years old).  The unit has one optical digital, one coax digital and several A/V inputs.  The remote lets you pick Video 1-3, CD, Tuner and Aux inputs.  You tell the system which audio source to use for each of these, one time and it remembers.  I liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present.  I was surprised to find how many premium HD movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in HD either.  I also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them.  On the negative side I, like other reviewers, bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub-woofer is required	1
B00007CWFG:better_than_original_carafe:j._smith	After the handle broke off the carafe that came with our Krups AromaControl (after about 2 years of use, perhaps several times a week), I found this one and ordered it.  My belief is that cleaning the original carafe in a dishwasher is what caused the handle to come off, however I am perturbed that I had to go to the trouble of replacing it.	1
B0006BAJK4:my_new_favorite_baby_gift:lisa_bennett	I bought this for my second son who is a year old.  I love it.  It's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag.  After he eats, I take it to the restroom and it rinses right off.  I've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well (and saves my floors!).  I recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this!!	1
B000G3E228:no_hot_import_toys!!!:barbara_russell_"soft_like_air"	Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys. That is my main point. It took a very long time to get to me (8 days) and when it did, it was broken. Not that it was shattered or it was jammed. It just didn't work. The piston seemed to be fine, the motor seemed to be connected, the gearbox seemed to be in tact, the batter (although a little hard to install) was charged, and the trigger was connected to the gear box. I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund. No. I e-mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks. Nothing! I got no response, no notification, nothing. I continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site! HIT is the worst company to buy from ever! From what i see and know, this gun seems to be quite the MPEG! I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately, I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back: telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren't allowed to exchange my product. BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!! Trust me. This is a good gun. Fast, accurate, good looking. Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive, having to find its broke, waiting for them to e-mail you back, and then have to live with a broken, useless piece of potential Airsoft gun. So trust me, don't buy from Hot Import Toys	0
B000KK4GUU:nice_suprise.:s.wall_"spooky"	I bought this for my wife as a "throw in" with more expensive items because it was so cheap.I actualy forgot I even ordered it until it came in. I was pleasantly surprised when she modeled it for me. Unlike a lot of stuff it looks exactly like the picture. She is a size small and it fit perfect. This not something most would wear out however as its insanly short which is great for me. The only thing that could improve this piece is a matching thong which is hard to find in lime green so maybe black would be a better choice if your trying to match things up	1

B0002OERUI:very_disappointed_in_this_one!:s._william_murray	I purchased, through work, the PowerShot S70 in July of 2005.  I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!	0
B000BXJ0F2:have_scooter_will_travel:happy_spike	Our very busy toddler (17 months old) is having a good time with this scooter.  It is very well made especially for the reasonable price.  The wheels do not scratch our wood floors, unlike some of her other toys.  She is our third and we have had our fair share of similar toys.  This one is one of the better ones.  The only down side is that it could be a little lower to the ground.  She is above average height and can just reach the floor well enough to push with her feet.  Our older girls were petitie and this would have been too big for them at the recommended age of 18 months.  Once they are in their twos, our girls have preferred trikes, so I'm also not sure how long this will last as a 'favorite', but it can definately be 'handed -down' or given to friends as it is going to last for years	1
B00007GVNM:extremelydisappointed:allison_i._marcoz	I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat.	0

B000EHQXAA:disappointed:lisa_a._phillips	I ordered the Smack and Yack:Disney Cars Sally, Lightning and Ramone for Christmas.  The only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was Ramone.  Sally and Lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour,  they wouldn't work at all.  I ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on Christmas.  I hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases	0

B00009XO9C:poor_quality_item:kcross57	I purchased this item for my son's birthday.  Not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it.  Also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly.  After a couple of  days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min. successful flight.    On the second day, after 15 mins of recharging the battery, the battery case and wires melted.  Have contacted company for a refund.	0

B000HI2MQA:great_design,_easy_to_use:ceabiscuit	It took no time to figure out how to use this seat.  My daughter meets the minimum height and weight requirements, so I am moving here from a 5 point harness Britax to this booster in a second car.  The seat is easy to install and remove, and also easy to stowe in the trunk when not in use by simply pulling the rear latch and folding.  I can definately see using it for travel on planes, as it is easy to fold and light enough to carry.  My daughter also likes the fold out cup holders for water.  They are sturdy and easy to tuck back in when storing or carrying the seat.  Highly recommended.	1

(the first 730's speaker grill came off, and i tried to glue it back on myself.  A word to the wise, don't use too much glue.)  So, I went to Nextel to get my new i760 after researching it on the internet.  I didn't need a camera phone, since I have a digital camera that takes awesome pictures.  One bad thing is that since I changed my phone back in April, I couldn't sign back up for two years and get the $150.  I could only sign up for a year, and I had to pay $275.  I don't understand that.	1

It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it.

B00004R9VW:snap,_crackle_and_pop:nomde_plume_"book_maven"	We replaced an old, larger and broken Sunbeam "Bug Snapper" with this unit.  This is lighter and easier to handle.  We're in Southern Arizona, so our bug season is just starting.  The unit works great, but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds . . . kind of gruesome.  If you're dealing with night-flying insects this is the solution	1

70332	This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.

B000N7M99U:good_idea,_bad_execution:t._salge_"still_thirsty"	I agree with the other reviewers that the idea for this product was going in the right direction, but took a bad turn somewhere. I get lightheaded trying to suck hard enough on the straw for it to register, and even when it does it is consistently 8 to 10 ounces off the mark of what I've actually consumed. And if you're really thirsty, forget it - you'll pass out before ever getting enough fluid to quench your thirst. At $30, it's a hefty price to pay when it's much simpler to just refill a 20-ounce plastic bottle 3 times a day. Sorry to say I'll be returning my HydraCoach	0
B000EUJD3Q:what_upgrade?___my_device_works_fine:wildaseel_forestmoon_"nita"	I've owned this pocket pc for a week now with very little problems.  I don't know anything about an upgrade but so far I haven't had any major problems with it.  When I left it in the car and then came home it wouldn't turn on.  I noticed it was very warm but as soon as I did a soft reset the device turned on.  The soft reset doesn't make you lose all your data.  I just had to reset the date.  I've had to do this a couple of times so far.	1

B000EC5OVO:a_wonderful_way_to_keep_track:susanna_hutcheson_"see_http://www.powerwriting.com"	I don't keep regular hours. So I don't want a book that goes from say 8 to 6 or whatever. This great Moleskine lets you track time the way you work. You can plan your week and make lots of notes on the right hand side. I love Moleskine. I write a lot with a fountain pen and the Moleskine paper is great for fountain pens. It's the finest paper you can buy. And this is a nice, buttery soft leather book. It's not too small or too large. I keep mine on my desk but often take it from room to room as needed. Or in the car. You can't go wrong with this book. And you never go wrong with Moleskine. It's always worth the extra cost	1
135641	bought a global knife a few years ago  then bought the water/ ceramic sharpening device. cannot keep this knife sharp. it sits in my block with a bunch of cheap 4 star henckels. I use the cheap sabatiers ($9 for the set and the block)	0
B0002JBHKG:safari_is_the_best!!!!:ruthie_"golflady103"	I love to wear Safari.  Several times a week someone will ask what kind of perfume I am wearing and comment how nice it smells.  I will continue to wear it until I can no longer get it.  Someone said it is discontinued.  Does anyone know?	1
15310	From using only two cordless controllers; this one and the XBox 360's controller, I like this one a LOT more. It's comfortable, small enough to not be too big, and just the right weight as to not be too light. I couldn't ask for a better controller- unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one, then I'd find myself that much more pleased :) Buy this one, there isn't a better wireless controller out there	1
B0000645RH:a_good_cat_doorbell_and_cableguy_catcher:technology_guy	I admit it -- sometimes I just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in. The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived.	1

B000FFRZ26:nothing_comes_close...:jennifer_l._cleveland_"longnights_books"	I bought this for my husband's birthday b/c I watched him fumble each morning with the numerous lemons that are out there. Carafes that leak, coffeemakers that don't keep the right temperature, etc...	1
180337	I bought this for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  Not only did he think it was great but also his 7 and 9 year old sisters.  There are so many games that there was something for all of them. We took the toy with us to Grandma's and even the older cousins found it very fun and entertaining.	1
B000ABAYMS:great_taste_and_good_nutrition:h._silvers	I am diabetic and I have been losing about 10 lbs per month for 6 months eating these bars as a between meal source of protein.  They satisfy my taste for something sweet and are filling.	1
B000AYIPFS:inflexible_&_uncustomizable_:a._fleming	We are very disappointed in this product because it provides almost no options to customize the spreadsheet.  We cannot rename catagories that are not applicable to us (i.e., child care), and we cannot create new categories that are specific to our needs.  What's even more limiting and disppointing is that you cannot create a different tab for each month to use for comparison, which makes us wonder what value we gain from having a single month of finances captured.  Finally, the bar graphs for summary comparisons are shaded the same color of the background which makes it very difficult to read	0
B000DZSC0C:i_cannot_sleep_without_it!:kelin_lopez	This pillow is the best! After sleeping with it the first night, I new I couldn't be without it.  My husband bought it for me and I am so thankful.  I left it at my mother's house one night and I could not sleep, I keep waking up.  The night after getting it back I slept like a baby again.  If you are having trouble sleeping you have to buy this!  Its very soft, and you can take the cover off to wash it	1

B0000DK6II:very_poor:d._ewing	FM transmitters of this size don't last forever. That is a fact I accept but I had hoped it would last longer than 2 weeks. I bought my first one from Target before a road trip in a uhaul without a cd player. The sound was marginal at best and by the end of the three day drive to Oregon it was extremely noisy. I plugged it in to my computer to transmit some streaming stations and it had trouble hitting the receiver (direct line of sight) no more than 40 feet away. Two more days and it crackled its last and died. I exchanged the transmitter at Target for a new one and a week and a half later I was returning that one as well. Spend a few extra bucks, save yourself the hassle and get a Belkin.	0
B000I1VEWO:do_no_buy_it:lance	It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible.  People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.	0

I couldn't get it to turn on, then after 8 minutes or so if it did turn on I couldn't get it to turn off.  It needs major redesigning.  I like the concept and it was comfortable but that's about all.  Barbara Baxte	0
538259	I have this Monster component cable and its proprietary optical cable (about $65 for both) and can say that it's the best connection you can find for your old XBOX. However, I can't really recommend them due to their high prices. If you can find the Microsoft HD pack, get that as it's much cheaper and accepts a generic optical cable. The only reason I bought this setup was because of their length (10 feet) which can go from one side of my entertainment center (where the xbox is) to the other side (where the stereo receiver is	1

348067	Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author	0

571082	As I read this book, When Madeline Was Young, I felt as though I was lost, wandering through a forest, searching for something - a beautiful butterfly, a perfect flower, a mystical cottage.  But there's nothing there.  It's just a forest full of a confusing tangle of leaves and vines and nothing mystical at all. And that's how this book is written.  It is a tangle of thoughts and words, spread from the first page to the last.  Nothing special at all.	0
B0006SJLNS:you_have_to_try_this_tea!:paul_a._spangler	The best experience for this tea is at the actual Pike Place Market where they brew it so you can sample it in their charming little store past the flying fish and florist.  It is also really great to have any other time in your life and to share with everyone you meet.  Since every grocery store doesn't stock this wonderful tea you will have to order it and stock your kitchen/office/cabin/whatever with it and enjoy	1
B0007LEG2K:it_pays_for_itself_with_one_use:william_j._niemi_"musician,_teacher,_engineer"	There are more expensive units out there and they might be appropriate for you if you need more information.  But this one is perfect for what I need.	1
B00005QJE0:jasmine,_peacocks,_bluebells:e._a._lovitt_"starmoth"	This bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who don't have two full-time gardeners on staff, or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells, or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against.  My Regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble New England farms, rather than building follies or planting mazes, or having their grounds landscaped by Capability Brown.	1
B000056OUX:balcony_safety_for_your_toddler:w._campbell_"leecinva"	Product shipped quickly and was well packaged. Each loop or hole on the edge has an individual string that you have to tread. Would have been better if the strings were attached to the netting. Overall, the product works very well and gave us the protection for our child we were looking for. Our 22 month old tested it contiually by pushing hard and running into it and there were no problems	1
1581125666:just_plain_awful.:e._carter_"catlover"	With someone like this teaching you a failing grade is the likely outcome.  Why Dunn feels it neccessary to quote from one of Shakespeare's most ridiculus plays and behave as if he is possessed is beyond me.  It's not funny or necessary and the problem is that the book is full of it - literally.	0
B00006408L:too_good_to_be_true:anna	I purchased this item after hearing comments that a unit that heats from top down works better.  I was highly disappointed with this unit as it does not heat the entire wipe, wipes must always be filled to the top and the wipe cools down too quickly.  Unfortunately I don't have the original box therefore cannot return the item.  I am now going to purchase a warmer that is sold from One Step Ahead that also heats wipes from top down but is not something that attaches to a wipe box.  Through friends I have heard this other unit works great and have been reassured that I won't be disappointed.  Hopefully BabiesRUs will sell this other item in the future	0

B00068O764:are_you_all_salespeople?_did_nothing_for_me!:student	This didn't do anything for me. Is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect? I am returning it. I'm really surprised others had such great results, because I tried it twice and left it on for double the time, and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream. It does have more than baking soda and H2O2- also contains catalase, some stearic acid, and some vitamin C. Of course, your skin already has its own catalase.	0

B00092M354:works_beautifully:cathy_"hair_freak"	I am a big fan of 2" curling irons, but they can be difficult to find.  My last one (different brand) wore out a couple years ago and I had a hard time finding a replacement until now.	1

B000E123IM:so_simple_and_delicious!:n._schmidt_"shopalotta"	This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store	1
B0009XH6V4:33805_micro_turbo_1600w_hair_dryer:carolyn	Compared to the Conair 1,600W I have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high-pitched when I first turned it on, but you may have a high-pitched blow dryer now--compared to my old Conair--and won't notice a difference. It doesn't have a cold air feature, which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair; or like me, in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable. These two drawbacks, especially having only the hot at high or low setting, is why I give it four out of five, instead of five out of five star rating.	1
B000ODZC9C:perfect_for_a_7_year_old:christopher_s._b._jam	Bought it for daughter's Christmas gift. She loves it. Cool color. Adjustable height is useful for her short height. She is very proud with it. Bigger wheels gives a bit more stability	1
B0007RAZ5G:great_gluten-fee_rice_crackers:jackie_meade_"gluten-free_girl"	My [...] was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers. When she had to go gluten-free, we searched for some adequate substitute.  While they are not cheddar goldfish crackers, they are very tasty and satisfying.	1
B000AXU1VA:not_as_cool_as_i_thought_it'd_be...:kitchen_mom	I used an avocado smaller than the tool, so I had to uncomfortably squeeze the tool until it'd fit.  Then it kind of smooshed my avocado into slices that were not attractive, while leaving a layer of unused avocado in the shell.	0

B0006NDCLU:not_worth_the_money:jane	This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow  the dozen or so chambers up.  The instructions were terrible.  You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next.  The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all.  My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again	0

557405	Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable.	1

B000GE1QBM:decent_mapping,_poor_feature_reliability_and_customer_service:j._perkins_"jp"	This unit satisfies in its GPS functionality, but is problematic elsewhere.  When I decided to purchase a GPS, I decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone (Motorola RAZR V3).  The bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes, even though the 6000T would still show the unit and phone as connected.  Customer service was no help.... it seems their script only includes the instructions "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).	0

B000A3T35A:defective_and_nothing_but_trouble!:jessa	I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.

The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!	0

B0002XP884:thule_lb58_58"_load_bars_(1pr):christopher_w._delong	The Thule load bars that I actually received were only 50 inches long, and I needed the 58 inch load bars, so I really couldn't do anything with them.  It specifically said right in the title that they were the 58 inch bars, but they were not.  I even wrote amazon  back to try and right the situation, but no one contacted me, so I had to sell the bars on ebay and buy another pair that were the right length	0

B00005B0BL:not_worth_a_whole_star:richard_e._woods_"sparksrick"	One star is the lowest rating I can give this system and it's frankly not worth even that. Problems start with the design. You have to take out eight tiny little screws to insert the backup batteries or plug in a sensor cable into the nifty looking "solar powered" sender unit, which has to be placed somewhere in full sunlight for it to function at all. Once you've mounted the unit on your roof, you have to remove those pesky little screws on the roof, in the freezing wind usually, several times a winter. Or wait for Spring and nice weather when you don't need to know if you can expect black ice on your early morning drive to work.	0
B00021FHQ4:these_things_are_huge!:vanessa_koeritz_"vanessa"	I bought this for my bf for a christmas gift.  He likes to bbq on a little propane grill. I guess I should have read the measurements of the tools. They are more suited for a huge grill. But its better than them being tiny. Good quality build. Might want to buy a nicer package to put them in if giving as a gift.	1

B000EZXYT0:in_for_a_chill:s._adams	I recieved this as a gift and have always loved other products by Philosophy.  This is GREAT for a hot, sticky day and you want to jump in the shower, exfoliate, and cool off.  The first time I used it, I have to admit I was freezing after my shower!  It has a very strong cooling effect that lasts on the skin for at least an hour. The smell is very natural, not artificial like a few other of Philosophy's 3in1.  It's a combo of mint and wintergreen..  I would compare it to their Candy Cane scent.  I've been using it reguarly after workouts & it's great!!  A nice cool down	1
B00005B1YG:history_as_it_happened...:michael_h._moore_"m2"	I love this old documentary...Capt Clark Gable does an excellent job narrating it, the color footage is a rare treat, and it gives an excellent insight into the day-to-day lives of those from the greatest generation.  It is a real tribute to all the men who flew bombers in WWII and we need to remember their service and sacrifices.  They fought a tougher war and sustained much greater losses than we have in Iraq or Afghanistan, plus they were gone for much longer periods and didn't have the technology such as email or video teleconferencing to keep in touch with their loved ones.  We need to remember them, as we are losing them quickly and soon they may all be gone.  But their legacy remains, and it is films like this one that preserves it	1

164566	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.  It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.  I take it with me everywhere,literally, it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable. There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.	1

With this release, Morissette has done a complete makeover of her look with a serious haircut and sporting a look of casual glamour like she's aspiring to take Hollywood by strom but isn't 100% sure. Maybe the new look and image might have worked if Morissette's makeover in sound was good enough to go with it-but it's not. This CD starts out good with the opening cut "Eight Easy Steps," a fast-paced rockin' tune with Alanis at the wheel of leadership but also ready to bust her own chops at the same moment. "Out is Through" follows and also stands out, but then So-Called Chaos begins to turn problematic by not having an edge. And Morissette should never have brought John Shanks or Tim Thorney(or both)on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks. "Doth I Protest Too Much" is without a doubt the worst song Alanis has ever recorded. The title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes overshadowed by Morissette's lyrics(yes, not her best work)when she refers to heartburn, headaches, and breached contracts as primary results of a chaotic lifestyle. The tracks continue with "All of Me," and "This Grudge," both rather dull, while the closing track "Everything" was a weak choice for the first single. Morissette has always been a progressive artist, but So-Called Chaos doesn't measure up to any of its predecessors, and may leave many fans longing to see the girl with the jagged heart still spinning with her free-flowing locks firmly in place.	0
0195110323:where_social_justice_may_be_impossible:a._g._plumb_"greg_plumb"	I will start this review by noting two things. I greatly appreciated Nussbaum's 'Upheavals of Thought', and I am uncomfortable with the way sex sits in the society I live in. (But, then, I recognise things in myself that - for good or bad - change my perspective from that of the society I am embedded in.) But Wedekind's play 'Springtime Awakening' should raise alarm bells for most of us.	1
B0007RPW2C:unreliable;_customer_"service"_a_joke:seattle_consumer_"i_buy_a_lot"	Unreliable pile of 'you-know-what'.  Worked fine for about 2 months then refused to power up.  Fresh batteries, no go.  Called customer "service".  Outsourced call center to India; rep followed generic script telling me to: 1) use lithium-ion batteries, and 2) press "power + NAV" simultaneously.  As suspected, bogus advice.  Fresh batteries metered out to 1.62 volts each / 4.84 volts total.  Yes, I tried lithium-ion batteries anyway.  Still no-go.  Am still waiting for Magellan/Thales to respond.  Am still owner of unreliable GPS.  Still have about $400 invested in unit plus software and maps.  Still kicking myself for buying a Magellan product.  Don't do it.  Really -- don't do it	0

B0006UHE8U:teaching_math_and_having_fun:froniga	This product was highly recommended by a school teacher in the UK as a great teaching tool.  It was well received as a gift by the children and their parents. An excellent math teaching tool that the children love.  It is portable, user friendly and has something for those on many different levels, so much so that one father, an engineer, loves to play the game by himself when travelling and is equally enjoyable to his 7 year old son, as well as a game that they can play together.  Math Whiz is a tool that creates a friendly math experience which can be used for many years as the upgrading levels will remain a challenge	1
B00004R9W6:a_whole_lotta_money_for_very_little_product:	Don't let the size of the box fool you.    Even though this item comes packaged in a good-sized box, this product is barely one inch by two inches.  It's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it.    Although it does seem to attract flies for a few days, it doesn't seem to last for very long at all.   It's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic!  In my opinion, it's just not worth it	0

Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files!	0
B000EALK8W:terrible:amy	i hate this phone.  i moved to miami and cannot get reception anywhere. it  cuts me off the minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside to talk.  i had to get a land line for the first time in over 5 years because i cannot use it in my apartment, so i am wasting tons of money on a land line with overpriced long distance rates.  but here's the thing:  other people on verizon using a different brand phone like LG have absolutely no problem!  they actually get a couple bars of reception, whereas i always have one or none at all.  i returned the phone and all they could do was give me another just like it... with all the same problems.  i actually had over 30 dropped calls in one month.  i am now stuck with it for the next 2 years unless i want to purchase another one for full price.  on top of that, people are right when they say the battery life is ridiculous.  unless you never talk on it, the battery wears out in a hurry.  and the volume buttons on the side are very hard to use when talking.  i usually end up putting it on speaker phone by accident.  i am trying to decide which is the lesser of two evils.. chucking this one in the drawer and purchasing a different one, or wasting money on a land line.  whatever you do, don't get suckered in by it's cute pink color, because underneath it's pretty exterior it's junk	0

B000GEFGTK:affordable_luxury:natalie_mommy_of_5	this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall	1

570314	I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud	0
0747576378:must_read:maximillian_"max"	I first picked up this book because i've always been interested in what young writers have to say. But i have to admit, even i was a little surprised. This story mind the mythicism, is a real representation of what young children's minds sometimes go through. That idea of a person you fabricated, gaining more reality than necessary. Congrats to Ms. Oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about.	1
B0000C9ZB8:watch:denise_e._pranger_"denise"	I loved the watch when I first received it.

99596	I have subscribed to this magazine for almost a year now and I have become very skeptical of much of its advice.  This advice seems to be heavily influenced by its paying advertisers e.g. the US Dairy Industry (there is always at least one of those annoying "got milk" ads) and not surprisingly, every issue there are several articles in the magazine that hype the supposed benefits of a diet high in dairy products (e.g. milk and cheese).  However having read many books on nutrition, it has become very clear to me that that the majority of current research shows that a diet high in dairy products can actually be very damaging to your health - for instance read the The China Study by Colin Campbell, an extremely comprehensive nutritional study that sheds a great deal of light on the US dairy industry and its shady methods of influencing the public's perception of the healthfulness of its products.  It is well known that there are many better ways of getting calcium etc into your diet than by dairy but this magazine is unfortunately blinded by its advertisers' paychecks.  The magazine also appears to be very similar to Prevention magazine which I also have subscribed to and I would make the same criticism of.  My advice is to stick to reliable sources on health like the excellent "Berkeley Wellness Letter" that are not supported or influenced by the advertisements of drugs companies or powerful industry groups like the US Dairy Industry	0
B0007XTN9E:more_like_mighty_wimpy_loader_and_misleading:gary_gnuu_"gary_gnuu"	On the shelf or on line, this trucks shovel appears to lock into position above the rig but it doesnt. It took me nearly 10 minutes to remove strapping anchored to this truck within the packaging. My son spent a minute playing with this truck only to move on to his other toys. Yeah, the shovel portion drags on the floor and will NOT lock into position above the rig. This truck can hardly be moved through the carpet much less in sand. I grew up with Tonka trucks and this was obviously designed by some young suit that was babysat by the television and playstation. If your looking for a durable fun truck for your child, move on as this truck wont get the smile your looking for.	0

B00004XP3L:cooperating_with_the_times:ali_winston	While Photek was (and still is) reknowned for his minimalist approach to breakbeats and electronic sound, his approach changes significantly on &quot;Solaris.&quot; Starting off with the first three tracks, his beats still retain some of the stattacco nature of his earlier work (especially on &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;), but sound more full, more resonant. The tracks where he wanders into the realm of House were quite repeditive, and despite Robert Owen's wonderful efforts (first time I've heard him), they were lacking. The best track on the album, and one of the best Photek works is definitely &quot;Infinity.&quot; The rumbling bass really cuts right to the core, and reminds me a little of Source Direct. The trip-hop efforts are good for his first attempt at such music, but the more ethereal &quot;Halogen&quot; left an impression. A wash of sound that previously Parkes would be itching to rip apart with a snare roll, it comes off much better for the lack of any true form. Not a great album, but solid and indicative of where Photek would like to go in terms of his future works	1
563269	I ordered this dvd series because I liked Kristy Alleys performance in other movies and series. But this is totally different. A lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted. After viewing two episodes I put it in the trash. Watching this does not make me happy	0

And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.	0

553263	I have owned a copy of this film for a long time. I have probably watched it ten times, and I always tear up a little at each viewing. From the beginning newsreel, of a shell-shocked Diane Feinstein announcing the less than hour old murders of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, to the final reel of Harvey Milk's prophetic and haunting statements, the viewer is mesmerized. Though Harvey Milk was a San Francisco city supervisor, his election in the 1970's, that of an open and unrepentant gay man, made national headlines . He was a ray of hope to gay people everywhere, who at that time were unrepresented and, for the most part, still forced into the closet. This film not only gives insight into the philosiphy of Harvey Milk, but is a rare document into that not so long ago but seemingly ancient time. Milk was a very eloquent speaker, and his sensibility, logic, and unapologetic viewpoint more often than not made mincemeat of any verbal opponent. This is best displayed in the footage of his  debate with then California Senator Briggs, a buffoon like character, who not only was a terrible speaker, who couldn't even clearly express his arguably irrational fears, but who in fact seemed much prissier than his nemesis Milk. The public view at that time was about family values, with the Anita Bryants condeming homosexuals to Hell for their decadent ways (Old times come round again....). Milk's voice opposed this view openly, and he seemed to predict his early demise at the hands of an assassin who was against what he represented. The notion of this martyrdom, and its romantic though fateful attraction to Milk, has been argued. Nevertheless, his bravery in representing the unrepresented cannot be argued, and the sordid details of his love affairs and personal life should not diminish his message, nor the admiration he deserves. This film unfolds as it happened, seeming like fiction, but all too real. As Milk is assassinated, along with the Mayor, by the homophobic and disgruntled resigned supervisor Dan White, whose subsequent trial, with the famous "Twinkie Defense", and his being sentenced to an appalling five years for the murders, resulted in riots the likes of which the city had never seen. As one of those interviewed here expresses with sad resignation,... if only the Mayor had been killed, White would have gotten life, but the fact that Milk, a gay man, had also been killed, leaned public sympathy  towards White, an absurd but all too realistic conclusion.There are many moving, telling, historically signifigant moments in this film, but none so clearly represents those times, and Milk's loss and legacy, as the film of the nighttime march in San Francisco right after the murders. Seas of people, holding candles and standing silently, came together in a very moving moment in time. This film, which won best documentary at that years Oscars, transcends its subject matter, and is simply a great documentary. Gay rights have made much progress. And perhaps time has diminished their names and these memories to most all, excluding those who were there, are old enough to remember , or are gay.  Nonetheless, Harvey Milk is a representive and icon of the early gay rights movement, and his legacy, through schools named after him, organizations, and his place in history as a voice for the all too often voiceless, lives on.	1

I had always rented snorkel gear before and this was the first time I decided to purchase a set.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  The fins are fantastic.  The design of this fin from US Divers with the split in the middle makes it extremely easy to move through the water - it's a great design feature!  The snorkel mask was comfortable and it never leaked.  The set also comes with a great blue and gray backpack that you can store all of your gear in	1
8372	I have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents.  Yes, the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities.  But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities.  Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start.  The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all.  The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process.  It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises.  This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy.  The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise.  Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there	1
079284355X:drama_about_domestic_terrorists:acute_observer	This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.	0

B000IEU3D2:for_a_small_not_very_moist_space_only:mindluge_"mental_inhabitant"	this unit is smaller than i was expecting; it is 11" tall and 5.5" in diameter.  i have it in our small bathroom at the moment because it was too small to affect the humidity level in the 120 square foot room i had originally put it in (i have a hygrometer in the room to measure its humidity and this unit did not affect the humidity level in 24 hours).  i doubt it is adequate for our tiny bathroom.  it seems like it might be adequate for a not-too-humid closet.  it says it removes 16oz. a day at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, but whose house it 86 degrees?  in our humid bathroom it  sucks up a mere third of an inch a day; i guess it performs better in a warmer space.	0

If you want healthy bread recipes try "Breadtime" by Cheney or "The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book" by Robertson.  Every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain.  I doubt that most people considering a book titled "Whole Grain Breads..." are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.  With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written.  Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none.	0

B000MEB3GE:must_have_-_they_should_issue_these_in_hospitals_when_you_give_birth:stacey_tipton_"mlinguist@aol.com"	This timer system is beyond helpful - it becomes your BRAIN when you have a newborn, as the hours, feedings and diaper changes become a total blur during this amazing yet totally sleep deprived time of your life.  While it would be nice to have a few more features like total ounces drank, whether the diaper was a wet one or a doodie, and tracking of daily totals for everything - that'd be more of a infantcare PDA, and is a bit beyond the scope of this little device.  All it aims to be is a timer that will keep track of the key stats in your baby's life, consequently making your life way easier.  I wake up in middle of the night and the baby is grunting, for example.    I click the backlight button and see that in fact the baby has only been asleep for an hour, and had a diaper and bottle right before that.  Then I just go back to sleep.  On the other hand, he beguns grunting and making noises and I see the Itzbeen says it's been 2 hours 30 minutes since his last bottle or diaper, and I know it's time to get up and feed him.	1

B000KZBAP4:excellent_tv!:mlb_fan	I researched TVs for a long time before I ended up buying this set.  It helped that Costco offered a coupon for $300 off the price ($1000 final price).   I thought I may not like the TV, so I decided to buy in person as opposed to online to help with a potential return.  However, there is no way I am returning this TV; it's awesome.  The picture is great, and that is just with SD.  The Strech feature makes the regular 4:3 picture fit the screen and not look distored.  I was worried about buying the 37" TV and then having to watch with the black bars on the sides to avoid distortion.  But there is no need with this TV since Sharp has figured out how to strech the picture without distortion.  DVDs look incredible on this TV as well.   What is even better is the built-in HD tuner.  I was debating upgrading my cable to the HD package, but I decide to spend $13 on "rabbit ears" from Target.  Oh my, once I plugged in the indoor antenna and let the TV track for digital stations I was amazed.  The analog station popped up like a fierce snowstorm in winter, but when I went up to the HD digital companion station, I couldn't believe my eyes.  An incredible HD picture with the rabbit ears set on my desk...indoors no less!   Why would I upgrade my cable TV to the HD package when they can't offer the local stations in HD?  Especially when they are FREE with a simple antenna!  I was told this was possible, but quite frankly I was skeptical.  Not anymore, I am so glad I got the Sharp that has the built-in tuner.  I seriously considered just buying the HD ready TV monitor and upgrade through my cable provider.  Boy am I glad that I didn't do that.  If you are in the market for a very nice TV that is easy to use and provides a great picture, I would highly recommend this set.	1
B000FS05VG:fast_drying_&_light:ginny_b	After looking into several reviews on blow dryers, I learned about the Revlon Tourmaline.  All of the reviews were so positive.  I've been suprised at how light the dryer is and how easy the controls are.  The placement couldn't be better on the controls. The price was right as well!  Blow dryers in this class are generally much more expensive.  A very good value	1
138546	Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?	0
B000FPWUOO:a_true_masterpiece!:pearl_drift_"ana"	I always buy this soap when I travel in France.  When I found it on Amazon, I was elated!  It is so moisturizing that I never need to use any body creams or lotions.  With its simple and pure properties of Olive Oil, Vegetable Oil and Mediterranean Sea Salted water; "Savon de Marseille" is the ultimate soap to use for dry skin.  The large 1000gm. blocks are a great value, and they can be cut easily into four individual 250gm. bars.  Great for ones' own personal use.  For gift giving the 300gm. bars are perfect!  If you want to walk out of the shower and not immediately feel compelled to put on hand cream or body cream, use this Masterpiece Soap	1

B0006G0IHI:eton_hits_a_triple_!!!!:colin_t._stump	I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a "Top of the line" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only "hit a triple"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run	1

However, it is for the better.  The new files are all compressed using the ZIP compression format so files are MUCH smaller (old files are 3-4 times larger than new files).

Well, I was excited to find one and I wanted to make sure that I would receive it in time to wrap it and mail it to Texas in time for Christmas.  I ordered in on the 27th and received it on Dec. 1st (I paid for faster shipping).  When I opened the box it was an Asian doll but not the one with the ponytails...this doll had short hair.  I called Amazon immediately and although they expressed being sorry they said that they could not guarantee that it wouldn't happen again. I have used Amazon before with no problems but I am extremely unhappy with the bait and switch.  I should have read the other reviews.  I will never let that happen again.

B000EIVKQ6:perfect_digital_camera:brandon_fournier	I can not find anything negative to say about this camera.  I wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as Casio's Exislim.  Even though this camera is not as small as the Casio, it is far superior of a camera.  Size why's, it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn't awkward or difficult to use.  The pictures from this camera turn out spectacular, the 10x zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera.  The lcd screen is also very clear, unlike the Casio and other camera's similar to this one.  You can't go wrong with this camera.  Highly recommended	1

It bends easily when you want it to, and does not bend when you don't want it to.  If you don't know how to bend the notes, get a Lee Oskar and learn how.  Then you can bend notes on any of the others, but it is harder and does not sound as good.  If you pay attention to the videos, most  of the professionals use this brand.  If you are a beginner, buy this because it make you sound better	1

157322233X:200_pages_of_unedited_notes:royal_diasticutis	This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read.  Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  He contradicts himself several times.  I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself.  He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom.  Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker.  He has not grown up yet.  That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes.  Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying	0

On phoning the company, they said plastic parts were only guaranteed for 1 month, hence they would not replace it. After another 2 months, the unit stopped working altogether. I then got in touch with the company and managed to speak to a very rude customer service representative, who said I would have to send it to the company and pay for shipping and handling myself, yet it says in the handbook that the company would pay for the shipping. I am truely disappointed with the lack of customer care and the appliance. I do believe I have a faulty appliance but the compnay is not at all bothered to keep its customers happy. I do not reccomend that anyone buy this item, save your money and all the hastle	0

B00000IS96:great_icebreaker:heidi_swanson	I've enjoyed playing this game with people from around the world- it seems to work best with a group of people who haven't been hanging out together since childhood. It gets people talking and makes for an evening of all sorts of interesting stories- and you get to find out what interesting people your friends are	1
B000C20MU4:she_is_beautiful,_but_not_very_durable.:tikallover	I had a problem with Brietta a day after I bought her. I was combing her hair, and suddenly her head broke! The part of her head that has hair seperated from her forehead, and there is no way to fix her. So she is stuck with a crack in her skull. I'm very upset about this.	0
B000E5KUKG:the_third_movie_is_horrible.......................:mogillon	The third movie has nothing to do with book 3. If you loved the books, you will find this movie completely unbelievable. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed of himself for being in this piece of garbage.	1

B00068NVG6:rogers_and_hammersteins_cinderella:angela_burton_"catholicgirly"	I loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it.  This did not make the movie any less great it just made the movie a little hard to follow because it kept repeating the intro. at the time that the commercial breaks should have been because of it being a TV show that was made into a movie	1
B000JHKADQ:my_opinion:cookiee_"movie_lover"	I was happy when this product arrived. It arrived in great time. I like the fact that it runs on a 9v battery and has the option of using two head sets. It states that it should be used in the last trimester, I am now 7 months pregnant and it still wont pick up my babys heart beat. I have even went to my appointmets with it thinking I am using it wrong. It will pick up my heart beat, but not the babys. I can't say it doesnt work because every woman is diffrent but it hasnt worked for me and as I mentioned it says to use it in your LAST trimester. The greatest thing about this is the cd's I play them for the baby every now and then	0

6300183963:"the_river":ray_saif	The art of farming is by far the oldest, most time-honored tradition. It is the ideal way to make an honest living, raise your family away from the madness of the city and gain self-satisfaction by doing something that really matters. "The River" effectivly portrays the plight experienced by many American farmers during the 1980's economical recession. Flooding, forclosure and overdue bills were just a part of life for those most discouraging and undeniably frightning of years. Farm-friendly legislation has been passed in recent years so farmers can apply for disaster relief, equipment loans and bankrupcy loans. The goal is to keep the Family Farm as part of American culture. "The River" was shot in Northwestern Tennessee near Kingsport, Bristol and Johnson City and also in Birmingham, Alabama. A 400-acre parcel of land alongside the Holston River, in Tennessee was cleared and turned into a real working farm in just four weeks. The flood scenes were produced in conjunction with the Tennessee Valley Authority using a dam upriver which was slated for repairs. The scenery in the movie is absolutly breathtaking. The mountains, fields and river all seem to blend into one big beautiful picture. "The River" was the third in a trio of farming-based movies that year. The other two are "Country", with Jessica Lange and "Places In the Heart" with Sally Field	1

B0001ILR1W:hate_this_bra!:v._ritter	I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut	0
B000BF74TY:cell_phone..:debbie	I've had my Tracfone for about 5 months now. The reception has been generally good. Once i got the phone activated, I haven't had any problems.

245424	The intercooler can, and in my case did, damage my 360. It sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360, which caused component failure. The worst part? As it's not an approved accessory for the 360, any damage it causes will void your warranty and you'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket	0
B000FED5DU:got_pain_to_use_first_time:z._h._abdul_"zahir"	Please careful about this Grooming Kit. I bought one week before and when I turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work. This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	0
B000F3AB0Q:gotta_love_him.:cocre_"cocre"	Much improved voice, same great guitar. Slow album, especially on his two remakes. Country sound on No Reason To Cry (beautiful solo). This CD would have been a 6 stars had he mixed in a thunderstorm to the background of Gonna Rain Today	1

The Canon WC-DC58A wide angle converter however is really good.  Tiffen made a better one but it seems to not be available anymore.	1

B00012175O:be_careful!:t._smith	I must admit, the first one that I ate was indeed tasty though slightly undercooked.  However, the second one was much less cooked and when I went to cut it, blood from the sausage squirted into my eye.  Now I am beside myself because I remembered my wife going on one night about blood- borne diseases.  I am scared that I might have unwittingly acquired Hepatitus or AIDS.  My wife told me not to worry because the animals the sausages are made from do not carry these diseases.  I refuse to take any chances because my wife and I are having problems.  I still await the results from the blood tests my doctor ordered.	0
0192834819:the_typesetting__for_this_edition_is_awful:penny_name	Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the  type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another    publisher's edition	0

B0002Z85E6:beautiful!:shopper	Very beautiful pearls. There are visible blemishes, which makes them appropriate to wear at work without me feeling overdressed. The uniformity is very good. All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts.	1
B00008X5BF:maintain_balance_and_you_won't_fall_off_(4.5_stars):norfeest_"yes_yes_y'all"	I'm not sure what took me so long to get it, but I'm just coming across this album.  It never made a blip on my radar I guess.  Anyway, I saw it at a local record store in the used bin for $2.00 and it was hardly used -- even the jewel case was flawless (it looked like it was only played once and then taken back to the store).  Obviously the owner before me didn't know what they had on their hands and the store manager didn't know either due to it's low price tag.  Balance is a must have album without question.  It came out in '03, I'm just getting it here in late '05 and it still sounds fresh.  There are so many bangers on this album that listing them would make this a five paragraph review.  Of the 16 joints (including the bonus track), I'd have to say that 14 of them are amazing.  Akrobatik rhymes with an honesty and realism that is rarely heard in rap (even amongst underground emcees).  The songs compliment and play off of each other without them all sounding the same.	1

44081	I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine.

B00005KGOG:a_big_disappointment:	I was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up. The joining brackets couldn't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart. I went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it. This is why I am returning it. If it's not safe for me to be in then I certainly don't want my daughter playing in it	0

B000FQVXG4:must_pay_for_company_support_:ducky	Contrary to the advertising about runs on vista, what comes in the box may not run on vista. Upgrade now says you are up to date but it is not., However, you can use product id to download the real vista version. BEWARE the product license says "The software...is provided on as as is basis without warranty of any kind..."I had a major mess with Nuance's product verification process. When the product did start to run, it was not correct. To date I've been charged for two support incidents(maybe more billing will hit my credit card later) and I've logged 3 hours on the phone within the first two weeks as well as several emails. Otherwise I like the product but one should not have to have hours of grief and pay and pay to get it running the first time. I'll never by another nuance product.	0
B000DT9356:really_great_for_young_children!:ljb	I bought this title because the first Typing Instructor For Kids got such good reviews.  I was looking for a way to teach my 8yo son keyboarding.

B0002QF1NI:best_cereal_for_the_entire_family:a._bartle_"sunflower"	I started eating Quaker Oat Bran 2 years ago because I wanted a cereal that is high in fiber and protein, yet low in sugar. It is so good as a cereal with milk, and it stays crunchy. It also makes a fantastic trail mix with almonds and dried cranberries or other dried fruit. It reminds me a little of Chex cereal or Life cereal, but it is much healthier and substantial. I have not found any cereal I like better. Now my kids love it, too. I can't keep enough of it in the house. And I prefer this cereal to Quaker Oats Squares, which are made of larger squares	1

B00021DB8A:i_love_these_vitamins!:tm_"tm"	What I like most about these vitamins is that they are very small and easy to swallow, unlike a lot of other hair and nail vitamins which are huge.

B000B6JAR2:you_won't_master_the_basics:triciajenn	I bought this for my two sons, ages 6 and 8, to help them develop speed with their memory math skills.  What a disappointment.  Even when they do know the answer quickly it can take them a good minute to find the actual answer in the game.  Each playtime you must start from the beginning a work back up to where you left off.  Good for review but it takes so long to get to the levels where practice is really needed.  I wish I'd purchased a different product	0
B000E8FF44:review_of_naturalizer_shoes:robin_m._abernathy	First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear	0

B00005A0Z7:the_operatic_second_season_of_"buffy_the_vampire_slayer":lawrance_m._bernabo	I do not consider it hyperbole to talk about the second season of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as scaling operatic heights, culminating with the glorious aria of "Becoming, Part 2," which I still relentlesly tout as one of the ten best dramatic hours on television I have ever seen in my life. I have watched a lot of television and have been teaching classes about this topic for over half my life, so I believe I can make a pretty convincing case. We witnesses the potential of this series in Season 1, when creator Joss Whedon held off on the revelation that the mysterious Angel was really a vampire, who just happened to have a soul and loved the Slayer, until half way through the abbreviated first season. In Season 2, we find out just how far true love can go wrong.	1

B000659JSI:good_first_grill:goku_"food_4_thought"	I'm happy with my grill.  Putting it together wasn't that hard.  It took me under an hour also, but one thing to note is that when putting on the right bar with the container make sure the container is placed properly before you completely jam in the bar or else it will be very difficult to remove the bar and properly place the container.  The grilling was great, flames were consistent.  Cleaning is a pain though , but I think thats a pain for all grills.	1

B000E0P1YQ:great_seat_for_traveling:d._patterson_"d._patterson"	We have taken this seat on three flights overseas and on a couple of domestic flights, as well as on many car trips at home and abroad.  It is great!  It is quick and easy to install forward or backward on airplanes and in cars.  On some plane seats the buckle is under the childs bottom, but the cushioning is adequate, my son has never complained.  He seems very comfortable in it.  "Baby Bargains" recommended this seat for travel back when my son was a baby, and I am online ordering one for my daughter right now.  If you expect to travel, this seat is an essential.  It is light enough that lugging it around airports, cruiseships and such is not a total pain (although as with any seat, it is nice to have a bag, we've done it both with and without)	1

B000295TXC:ok_but_not_a_bel_canto_singer:daniel_g._madigan	Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.	0
B000BN3A4Y:good_product_-_costly_shipping:paul_f._judge_"paul_in_boise"	The LifeHammer is a good product, a bit small but I have seen tests on Mythbusters (Discovery Channel) and it seems to work just fine.  I purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me.  If I could find this product in a brick and mortar store, I would have purchased it there.	1

B000MQNMQ6:overpriced,_under-featured,_misleading.:katherine_anne_welles	O.K., so I'm paying $300 for a set-top box with a 40Gb hard drive, but I can't use it as a DVR? Why not? Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box.	0
6304584210:best_actors_but_script_doesn't_do_justice.:	Overall, I have always enjoyed Robin William and Billy Crystal's performance in many other movies, but I must admit  to my surprise that it wasn't making me laughing on the floor as I usually do. The script was boring and the plot was downright disppointing. Didn't like the ending. It was like a stupid wild goose chase for both of them and end up accepting that the mother of the son lied to them.  Which is really a bad example for younger audience to see this and thinking it's normal for mothers to lie.  I hope someday to see both Robin and Billy to act together in another movie in the near future and hopefully better script than this one	0

It's hard to choose colleges just by what you hear by older people but this book is extremely useful in information you need to know before  visitng a college. I would reccomand this book.

B000069HY7:a_big_disappointment:	This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as "The Cat In The Hat" and "The Grinch".

We give this video a thumbs down	0

I would recommend this book for any creative child - we will definately be buying more in this series	1
162041	Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore	0
B0002M7FCC:powerful,_tight_bass:shane_n._cotee	I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.	1
606167	I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it	0
B000700JNG:top_notch_phone_case!:itipover	This is a great case! I have a Motorola V180 and have purchased and returned 2 phone cases prior to this purchase having only had the phone for a month because they were such poor quality or the holes didn't line up.  Because this is a flip phone, most cases move when you open and shut the phone, covering speakers, etc.  This case is 2 pieces that connect together so the movement, when you open and close the phone, doesn't affect the placement of the holes, etc. in the case.  Also, the quality of materials and fit of this case are excellent.	1
B000046S2U:not_exactly_odorless!:boca_mommy	My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.	0
B000EVKHOO:saved_the_day!:k._nettles	This is the first gluten-free product I found that my daughter likes.  Perhaps "likes" isn't the right word -- she eats large helpings every time I serve it.  For a little variety, I put some broccoli cuts or carrots right into the mix.	1

I was told by Nova Development that the merging of photo shows was not being supported by the company since the CD writer was a free add on to the program. The box and program info did not indicate that. I offered to purchase the full program but it is not available anywhere	0
B00005BTSQ:great_classic!:l.c.	I give this 4 stars, because I like it (maybe more than my toddler). When I was in kindergarten or 1st grade, my little brother, who was 1 or 2 at the time, had the original -- the one that just popped, and he loved it.  He would push it around until the popping drove my father "crazy." This one does even more.  It pops, counts from 1 to 10, plays music, and has flashing lights.  I think it's an awesome toy, especially for the price.  My daughter doesn't play with it every day, but when she grabs it, she'll push it around for maybe 10 minutes or more (we haven't found a single toy that will occupy her attention for longer than that).  Sometimes, she'll push it around several times a day.  It's great for that stage when your toddler likes to push or drag things around with them.  The popping was inconsistent when we first received it, but we took it apart, got the gears aligned correctly (through trial & error), added more Vaseline to the gears for lubrication, and now it pops, counts, plays music, and the lights flash consistently every time.  If you take this toy apart, be careful not to pull out the speaker wires -- we did that, but it was no problem.  My husband soldered the wires back together	1

B0009VU7JO:unreliable_product_and_unresponsive_customer_service:bonnie_p	After less than one week of use, I am forced to return this product due to its inability to maintain a reliable network connection.  In 5 days, I have had to cycle power on this unit, on average, more than once per day after it locks up.  The Web UI fails to respond to connection requests, it loses the ability to communicate with the internet and the only solution is to cycle power.  I have tried to work with NetGear technical support, but their suggestions (e.g., lower MTU) have been useless and their responses quite tardy.  If you are looking for a firewall/VPN unit, I suggest you pass on this particular product	0
B00068O1II:good_overall_product:wylie	I received this product as a X-Mas gift this year. I really do like it, considering the last two Philosophy products I did not care for (The Gingerbread Man Bodywash and Amen Cologne). Out of the tube, it's a little thick, but you only need a thin layer to do the trick. It offers up a nice smooth shave, and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward. Definitely a keeper..	1

310248	I also bought this magazine sight-unseen and I wish I hadn't.  For re-decorating purposes, I found this magazine to be not useful at all.  The homes and gardens are pretty, but what they feature (furniture, wall and window coverings) just would not go with the middle-class home...way too opulent.  I was wanting more of a magazine that could give me a look that can be found in local or chain furniture stores... not that would try to make me get a one-of-a-kind table from XYZ Antique store in New York.  Also, I found this magazine text-heavy.  All in all, an OK magazine for a professional decorater maybe, but not for a average home-owner trying to redecorate	0
B000HGHIM0:favorite_body_shop_scent!:heather	I recently became a fan of Body Shop products and am only sorry that I didn't try them sooner.  Their products are all, without fail, of superior quality.  The Satsuma line especially is wonderful, and is my favorite scent from the Body Shop.  It is the juicy fresh smell of tangerines/oranges.  I have read some reviews that it reminds people of a creamsicle type scent but I completely disagree with that. I have never liked creamsicle scents and I love Satsuma.  It is not cloying or too sweet.  It is a very pure scent and I always feel clean and beautiful while wearing it.  One other thing to note about this product...  I do not always like perfume oils because the scent is not always accurate when compared to other products in the same line.  I am not sure if this is because sometimes the oils are so concentrated that they smell like "too much".  The Satsuma oil is not like that at all - it smells true to the rest of the line.  The scent also lasts for a long time after being applied, due to the fact that it is a perfume oil.  A little goes a long way - I would not be surprised if the bottle lasted for over a year.  I love this product and give it my highest recommendation.	1
B000930CII:i'd_rather_give_it_no_stars:mary_b._vandegrift_"brady's_mommy"	Horrible advertising on these packages.  It shows a huge delicious bowl of pasta when says 4 pack, but it only makes two "bowls" of pasta.  The servings are so tiny, that if you make both packets together, you maybe get a half a bowl of pasta.  Not to mention that it takes about 11-15 minutes to cook!  Pasta's so sticky you have to use no-stick spray.  The taste is so bad my son, who eats anything wouldn't touch it, and the sauce packet was hard as a rock, so it didn't mix up and left big chunks in the ketchup you have to add.  We tried the mac and cheese too, it takes 15 minutes to cook and again says 4 pack, but that's only 2 pastas and 2 cheeses.  Very expensive, hardly any food, and pretty nasty to eat.  They need to be alot more realistic on their packaging instead of trying to use false pictures and saying "4pack"  Eight thumbs down from this family	0
284656	There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying!	1

51776	When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.

0698119290:best_friends_forever:	This book reveiw is on a book named Last Summer with Maizon.  This book is about two best friends named Margarate and Maizon who lives on Madison Street.  Her friend Maizon was accepted to Blue Hills, a school where really educated people go.  Margarate does not want them to be separated.  Every night she wishes Maizon will not get accepted.  But when Margarate's father has a second heart attack, he dies and now all Margarate has is Maizon, her mother, her little brother Jay and the people around.  Margarete was having a rough time anyway and then Maizon got accepted to Blue Hills.  When it was time for Maizon to leave Margarate, her mother and Maizon's grandmother dropped her off.  When Maizon wasn't there with Margarate her whole life changed.  At school she was becoming popular, she was liked now.  Days passed by and Maizon still didn't call.  When Margarate went to go get her brother at her neighbors house, that's when Maizon calls.  Margarate was so excited that Maizon wanted to come home.  Margarate ran to the grandmother's house telling her the news.  Margarate said Maizon wants to come home, the grandmother says that she would go get her.  When Maizon got home it was like old times, they ran into each others arms.  They then went to their favorite spot and started talking.  Maizon said she came back because she wasn't being treated right, she didn't feel the same. So they sat there and talked and felt like old times with my best friend Maizon.  I think that this book should have gotten an award or five stars.  This book has mostly everything of real life.  It deals with best friends, for example like my friendship with Kiena.  It has separation, like my sister and me.  It has a lost loved one like my godfather and it has a lesson like when you do wrong and learn your lesson.  I think that this book should have five stars because it really relates to real life,it shows friendship and it shows and explains what happens in real life.  I like this book because it reminds me of my life, me and my friends, how we argue and lose our friendship and then gain it back with a little talking.  It reminds me of how I lose people in my family and then cry because I miss them.  If I could buy this book, I would let my whole family read it, I would make it our reference book for when we need advice or something to do.  This book is so good that all my friends wanted to read it.  It is so good that I really read it because I don't really read books and when I read the book it made me think of when my best friend Ariel was going to move and how it made me feel, and how I compare it to Margarate and Maizon.  This book is excellent, the author really put their heart in it and that they were depressed and needed a friend.  If you ask my best friend Johnniece, she'll say that she really enjoyed the book, that it should get five stars, because the author really put thought, confidence, respect, love, care and her whole heart into this book.  When I say she put confidence in this book I meant that she wrote it knowning that it will be a hit.  The author thought about the words, thought her life and compared it and started writing it with compassion.  I think that this book should be the book of the month in my school, because it shows and teaches a lesson.  With the summary I wrote I put my heart in it because when I read it, it touched my heart.  I won't want my friend away from me.  I think that I mostly relate to Maizon, because when she left Margarte was beginning to be liked, and the girl was talking about Maizon and Margarte sat there and watched and listened instead of doing the right thing and telling them to stop doing that to their friend.  I relate to Maizon, I relate to her because if people don't like me, I don't care.  If people want me out of somewhere, then I'll leave and if people love me, I love them back and that's how Maizon is.  She doesn't take junk.  Alot of people relate to Maizon.  This book is interesting and gets interesting as you read on.  This book is really a good book that shows you friendship, break-up and everything else that deals with real life.  I love this book, it is really good and I think that if most people had this book then they wouldn't be out doing the stupid and illegal things that they are doing.  This book really didn't grasp Dr. Kings dream because when Maizon went to Blue Hills, the whites were treating her bad, they saw her different.  Brenliniqua, Class 7-512	1
B00005NKCB:for_mamet_fans_only!:kfbeau	I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing	0
B0000BXHPB:great_for_a_re-beginner.:squirrelgonewild	I bought this bike for myself and I love it.  I got it for half the listed price.  It was originally intended as a starter to introduce myself back in to biking (at 30+yrs old) but I'm going to stick with it.  The other buyer with the bad experience must have gotten a bad bike.  The brakes are excellent and the bike itself, including shocks, are just as sturdy as my husband's expensive pro bike.  The 24inch is perfect for me, being barely five-foot-two; and doesn't seem too juvenile in stature or in color.  I highly recommend this bike	1

It is the only one that will put a short point on them, and I realize this review is similar to the one above. What I don't understand is how everyone else above seems to be getting such a long wear out of them, because I go through one of these every 3 months or so, just about the time the warranty wears out (how strange).  If anyone has a better sharpener that puts the same short-angle point on these pencils, but last longer than three months, I would love to know about it, especially since Staples no longer carries it in my area.	1

Finally, I received the Screwpull as a gift, and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end! As others have said, the Screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up, so there's no actual "pulling" whatsoever--all you do is simiply turn the easy-to-use lever at the top of the device. In almost 10 years of usage, the Screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork; on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try (probably because I started too close to the edge), simply starting over solved the problem. Spend a little more money to buy the Screwpull, and you'll never need to buy another corkscrew again; highly recommended	1
49591	Tom Friedman's writing style is easy to read and his overarching concepts-webs and walls; states v. markets v. individuals; and the comprehensive failure of the Arab street, leadership and Muslim clergy to combat the really tough and valid questions of the day-are extremely well thought-out. From reading this compilation of NYT columns, I understand where Friedman conceived many of his ideas for his current best-selling book, 'The World is Flat.' Although I sometimes disagree with his opinions, his ability to see the big picture is spot on	1
176887	At the end of the day, when you come home from school or work, one can't say &quot;I feel great.&quot; Rather than great, we are stressed and tired. The sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this CD captures it it almost perfectly. I too, am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain; and it does work. It would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping. With quiet, natural sounds, it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you	1
B00066ISVQ:quiet,_low_air_flow,_even_on_high.:j._garrett	Claiming that this fan's "3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance with maximum cooling", is very misleading. On low, the fan barely moves any air. On high, it still doesn't move much air, and is incredibly quiet, nearing silent in my opinion. If you are looking for a high performance fan that can be turned down while not under heavy loads, this is NOT the fan for you. The 3-speed switch is useless, as there is no reason to run it on anything other than high	0

B000BUTCXA:very_cute,_great_for_children:joshua_senecal	We've had one in the house for a few years now. The kids (5 and 2-1/2) love it. It's soft, cuddly, and sized just right for them. It's been taken all over the place, has provided companionship for them on many a long trip (including two to South Korea), given comfort when they are sad, and been used for countless hours of make-believe. Its worth has been far more than what was paid for it	1
B0006IINYQ:item_did_not_work:john_s._maslanka	When we tried to play the item on our DVD player the beginning and the end were all garbled and we had to return it.  We ordered another copy direct from the manufacturer, which worked properly.  I am upset that the full purchase price was not refunded.  I can see deducting shipping and handling.  But, a restocking charge -- that is outrageous!  The merchandise did not work properly and there was no offer made to replace it!  Please remind me not to buy from amazon.com	0
0787972533:a_deatiled_book_for_use_only_on_an_&quot;as_needed&quot;_basis.:akt2@cyberg8t.com_"llapis"	I'm very disappointed in this book, although some information IN it is valuable, it will take a long time to read the entire book cover to cover. It is an excellent Textbook but not a handy guide to flip to on a regular  basis and find ideas for what you need. Although broken into sections, they  are not readily found or visible. One must search the information needed as  in a research assignment. The reproducibles are MAINLY for elementary  grades. This was not stated in the very short and brief summary of it's  contents, on-line. Although the price was reasonable, I'm not pleased with  the way the book is organized &amp; printed	0

B0000DDVTI:never_again.:nancy_b.	I could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived.  When I opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off.  When I looked at the pin I noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli.  I thought that was bad enough but when I turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces.  Needless to say, it's useless.  This was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last	0

B0008MO8J4:great_while_it_lasts...:r._cork	I LOVED this printer!!  The print quality is truly phenomenal!  I had a few issues with paper sizes, too many pieces being fed through, the rear feed slot, same as other reviewers, but looked beyond those because the prints were so wonderful.  And yes, I am speaking in past tense of my wonderful printer, because it is DEAD at the ripe old age of 13 months!  Exactly ONE MONTH after the 1-yr warranty, my printer is "unfixable".  And HP won't do anything for me... after speaking to 8 people on the phone (only one of which I understood fully) and 3 supervisors, they just said that I'm SOL... So, yes, very nice printer, if it lasts	0
579992	Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.

B00005BSM3:another_so-so_product_from_safety_first:sara_m	The kneeling stool is great.  The padding is sufficient and I love that it flips over to convert to a stool...Very useful!   BUT...the elbow pad is a joke!  There is a hard plastic honey comb underneath it and hard plastic surrounding it that force you to put your elbows into two tiny areas or risk severe pain from the plastic.  Not to mention that to two measley suction cups that are suppose to hold it onto the side of the tub do not work at all.  It constantly pops off the tub whenever I put any weight on it.  I don't regret my purchase because of the stool which works really great. I suggest that if you still want this product after reading the reviews, you try to find it used so that you don't have to pay retail	0
B000AAYC86:too_wobbly!:j._koontz_"track_star"	The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!

I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch.	0
B000CDHS7I:not_designed_to_last:s._struble	A year of one time daily use and this coffee maker is already going in the trash.  The swing-out filter "hinges" broke during normal use.  Once broken, the filter now no longer stays in place and falls out when the carafe is removed.  Hence it's ready for the wastebasket.  On closer inspection, the entire filter unit is made of plastic, and the hinges are only a few mm's in diameter. Sturdier design needed!	0

B000GWPTLC:starts_out_okay,_but_the_shine_fades_after_a_few_weeks.:k._robert_keller	The only good thing I can say is the print quality is fine and the wireless network works.  But...software installation is long and tedious (and took three times on one laptop to get to work). Installed drivers cause my PC to take 45+ seconds longer to boot and sometimes (about 30%) stop the shut-down sequence (I have to click "end" in a dialogue box).  The ink runs out (even the big black one) amazingly quickly and replacements are $54 at Costco.  It seems you gotta get ONLY HP cartridges, as third-party cartridges fail.  I'll never buy another HP printer	0

B0002H4NQ8:swim_belt:d._cipriano	THe swim belt I ordered was awesome.  Perfect for my 3 year old to learn how to swim.  The great thing about it is that you can adjust their bouyancy.   Take one or two of the floaty squares off and they have to try to swim a little harder.  It also helps them keep the correct body position for learning how to swim	1
B0000C8AO4:only_highlights:thenightfly_"dee"	I heard that the NFL was releasing the past superbowls on dvd, I was excited to say the least. Then I found out these are only highlight films. A real dissappointment to say the least. The films are available in their entirety; why not release them? I was willing to pay well over one hundred dollars for each box of ten super bowls, as were several of the people that I was at a super bowl party with this year. Too bad the NFL fell short again.	0
186688	As an ER/Trauma nurse I have seen and been involved in many, many cardiac arrests. Here is some information that you need to know 1) You must still perform adequate CPR, if not brain death occurs within 4 minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain! 2) Even with trained personnel, CPR, a defibrillator and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (medications) the survival rate is very, very low.	1
B0006I5G1O:crowns_and_gowns_game_review:c._ellis_"ccls"	Twice I gave this board game as a gift this holiday season, and my own 5-year-old daughter received it as a gift. While the idea of the game seems good, there seems to be some misleading print on the box. It indicates that the prinesses will be getting ready to meet Prince Charming at the ball, but there is no Prince Charming included in the game pieces--much to the dismay of my daughter! My biggest complaint about this game, however, is with the gowns and accessories the princesses wear as they move about the board. The straps of the dresses are very thin, and my daughter has broken three of the four gowns. She has also broken two crowns and the strap on one purse. My daughter plays with the rubber Polly Pocket things as well, and she has not torn/ripped any of those items, which makes me think the Crowns and Gowns items aren't made as strongly	0

B0000DJ83R:worth_every_penny:j._caputo	My family and I tried Omaha Steaks Hamburgers about 6 months ago and have purchased 3 of these picnic packs.  You have never tasted a hot dog until you have tried one of these 3oz dogs!  I would never return to regular grocery store hot dogs!  Definitely worth the money.  The nice feature is that you can order them and have them delivered whenever you want.  Even in warm climates, whatever you order will come in a cooler and packed well with ice.  Order a couple at the beginning of the Summer, and BBQ until your heart is content	1
B000AA4IQC:visually_and_emotionally_stunning:william_wilcox	I am 62 years old, and seen them all.  I have NEVER seen anyone as visually and emotionally stunning as Beth Hart at the Paradiso!  Simply the most powerful stage performance I have ever witnessed!  She takes every single song to an epic level of entertainment, and just plain never coasts through a song. Some of the spectators in attendance looked almost scared by what they were seeing, and most were mesmerized by her on-stage and off stage sexually potent antics!  She has been compared to Janis.  I saw Janis twice, and Beth Hart would bury Janis in any category!  I can't imagine how she can possibly maintain a level like that captured at the Paradiso for very long--it just doesn't seem humanly possible!  I am so glad someone was there with so highly skilled a video crew to capture one of the most shattering evenings of music ever.  Magnificent in its fury!	1

Not paying close enough attention and because the title does have stylus in it I assumed it was compatable with the camera I was purchasing at that time.  No it was not!!!  So I paid for and wraped (christmas present) something that did not only not work for the camera but made me look like a idiot shopper when my husband opened it and saw that it was not compatiable.  Now I have to figure out how to send it back for a refund which will cost me shipping charges yet again...NOT TO MENTION THE FRUSTRATION OF A RETURN!!!!	0

I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price	1
B00063KI5S:success_on_an_australian_shepherd:tread_lightly	We have an Aussie/Healer mix (we think...she was a foundling) with a thick, soft coat. I've had her professionally groomed once a year for about 7 years at $60 to $75 a pop so last summer I decided to try it myself with this clipper kit.  To make a long story short, she didn't turn out so bad! (Well, the neighbors didn't laugh, anyway!) It took me a while to get the hang of it--I finally chucked the various combs and went with the bare clippers--but she didn't complain and I had a "cool" dog for much less $$$ than a pro cut.  The best part was I could keep her trimmed all summer as her heavy coat grew back.  No report as yet how long the blades last, but I'm already money ahead even if I must replace them next year	1
B000FFLXRO:not_so_good:a._jennings_"gluten-free"	I thought  they had a stale texture and they didn't have enough salt. Ener-G does make a type of sesame pretzel that is incredible but these aren't it. Hope this helps all the gluten-free people like me	0
B0002K9H6G:too_small:zachary_thomas	I loved this mattress pad when I first opened it, it's made of soft, natural cotton and offers a nice cushion for baby. However, after washing it, I found it's too small for the crib mattress, which is a standard size. I think they just skimped on material, or didn't pre-wash. It's a good 2 inches too short! It doesn't have much stretch to it, so I'm afraid I won't be able to use it all! Very disappointing	0

138899	This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play. You don't exactly "finish" it, like other video games, but are always trying to beat your fastest time, so it doesn't get old as fast. As a matter of fact, we wore out our last copy and this is our second.	1
B000JH0W6Q:travalon_luggage_scale:v._allwardt_"shopper"	This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.

If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror.	1
B0001NE97Q:great_drinking_cup!!:gabriela_veith_"zaiyra"	My boy loves his drinking funtainer!  It has never spilled on his lunch box even though I have put it in different positions including upside down!  It it great because we can take it on a car ride and it will NOT spill all over the car if he drops it and it will keep his milk cold and even warm chocolate hot!  The straw that pops up when you open the lid is a plus and I have not had to replace it and the year is almost over!!  Very durable.  I love it and I'm planning to buy more!  It is well worth the money... and I bought it for $15.00!!	1
B000EI2O3Y:so_glad_i_bought_this_stroller....:d._reich	My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..	1

B000BMBU7O:superbly_designed_car_seat!:a._larsen	I don't generally write reviews but wanted to praise Baby Trend on the design of this car seat.

B0009F8RAQ:can't_figure_it_out:j._clarkson_"mupificus"	I've tried this sling about 4 times with my now 10 week-old son.  I just can't get it to work so that he seems comfortable.  He usually cries when he is in it.  He fell asleep in it once, but he looked so contorted.  It's just so tight against my body that it bends him the wrong way.  And the pocket is so deep it closes over his head. And I know I got the correct size. I've given up and am looking for a better sling.  Right now we use our baby bjorn several times a day, and he loves it, but it's a little cumbersome, and I want him to be able to recline.	0

B000B90G9K:a_tub_seat_that_grows_with_your_baby!:gillian_kies_"an_avid_reader"	My 4.5 month old son has never liked the plastic bathing tubs, so right from the very beginning, he's been in the big tub with a tub seat. He loved bath time until just a few weeks ago, when he outgrew our original Especially for Baby (the BRU "house" brand) tub seat. In desperation, we searched the shelves at BRU and settled on the Mother's Touch.	1
B000F791EE:as_described,_but_large_for_me:anonymous	I returned these, because they were too large for me. To be fair to Zina, they were as described, and I wasn't sure they would work.

B000AYF9PM:worthless:alvaro_rodriguez	I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.	0
169656	I bought this album after hearing America, their single off this album, and listening to the increasing hype about Razorlight and Johnny Borrell being one of the most talented singer-songwriters of his generation. This follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first. It's not bad, but it's not that good either. The songs all sound like I've heard them somewhere before, and the lyrics - well, how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone, nothing on the radio, and not known what it all meant, while smoking cigarettes late at night. Yawn...	0
B00005N90Y:unforgettable_(unfortunately):ray_cassavaugh	This movie survives in my memory for over 40 years as one of the most boring stupid excuses for a comedy ever made.  I use it as a benchmark to compare all other really bad comedies.  They are either worse than this one (rare) or better than this one. As an example: Buffalo '66 is worse.  If you watch both in the same day, you will surely die	0

242742	I am married to a native New Yorker and we spent an entire weekend looking over this book and talking about many of the wonderful places it mentions, many of which we still visit today. As an extra bonus for avid cooks, there are recipes. For anyone who remembers Luchows or any of the other venerable, now closed restaurants the book mentions, it will take you back to happy times and good memories. It's an excellent book and clearly Schwartz has poured a great deal of research into what is his labor of love.	1

This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	1
470109	My mother bought me a gift subscription when I moved in to my first apartment. I love this magazine. I pass the recipies on to family and friends, who have enjoyed them as well.

185695742X:don't_panic:marvin	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the number one best selling book in the galaxy for many reasons. One it is slightly cheaper than others, but most important is that it has the words'Don't Panic' written in bold letters on the cover. The story of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy revolves around this remarkable book. This story strangely begins when the earth is destroyed by a Vogon construction fleet clearing the way for a hyper space express way. The last Earthman, Arthur Dent, is saved by his best friend Ford Prefect, who is actually an alien that comed from a small palnet somewhere in the vecinity of Betelgeuse. They are soon thrown out of an air lack and rescued by the Heart of Gold using the Infinate Improbability Drive. Inside they meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two headed, three armed president of the galaxy, Trillian, an Earthwoman who Arthur failed to pick up and wnt with Zaphod, and Marvin, a parinoid android. This book tells of there amazing adventures throughought the galaxy. These adventures involve mice, an abandonded planet, a rather suprised sperm whale, and the number 42.	1

B000B9RH42:very_disappointing:s._leigh_whitaker_"gadgetlover"	We bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  Like the previous reviewer we also didn't realize we needed to dilute the paint first.  Even with the paint diluted properly it doesn't really work as expected.  You have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on.  Even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down.  I plan on returning this toy for a refund as well.	0
105271	I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.	0
B000F4USEY:huge_waste_of_money!:s._whittaker	I bought this product thrilled with the thought that I could use an epilator in the shower.  Even though that's possible, the very last thing this product does is remove hair -- at least with the epilator head.  The shaving head works fairly well, but a simple shaver would cost a lot less and shave as well or better.  I can't believe Panasonic thinks they'll actually keep customers selling something this ineffective	0
B000IMDD6I:avoid_this_stuff:nicholas_souris	I bought two of these as Christas gifts.  One for my son and one for my nephew.  My kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and I are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash.  Not only does this stuff look like sand, but it gets into EVERYTHING just like real sand.  The play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess.  On top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well.  All and all I would reccomend this product only for childeren over 8yrs and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up.	0

B0002AT4QY:great_concept,_but._._._:j._young	This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks.  For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work.  The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it.  The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty.  so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on.  So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great.  Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do	0

B00006BNFR:thanks!:"spppppyyyyygggggggiiirrrl"	Wow! I love this spykids movie way better than the first one. I think of the first one as an introduction for the characters and the sequel is the big adventure for all the Cortezes and even more characters, like the Giggleses. We met Donnagon in the first movie, and he was the reason for the Cortez parents to go on the mission. Now we see that he has kids and we relize that he has bigger plans for the OSS. And what about Alexandra, the preisidants daughter? She is the main reason we know about the transmooker device, right? Also grandma and grandpa Cortez are joining us in this movie. I think Robert Rodregiuz did an execallent job on the sequel, Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams. ... The sequel is awesome!!!!	1

Unfortunately, they have the option of sending you a refurbished model, which means that they tried to fix someone else's problem phone and pawn it off on you. This one is going to get flushed as soon as I find another phone to buy, since Cingular says it's now out of warranty and I'm not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months	0

They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . )  HA!!!!  HUGE mistake.  The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks.  Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen.  Totally, completely unwatchable.  It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like "motion art," not like a proper video at all.  Avoid this product!!	0

It is easy to work with, not too large, and will help you save a lot of money on oil changes, being that doing it yourself costs around fifteen dollars, versus the fifty dollars it will cost you at a mechanic.

What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one	0

266629	I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichd classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.	0

B00028U6BI:music_to_sleep_by...:m._harris	When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing	0

B0001XGNQQ:one_razor_to_rule_them_all!:nathaniel_a._mclaughlin_"saint_apathy"	I received this razor as a birthday gift from my brother a couple of weeks ago. I thought, "Hmmm...Handsome looking vintage piece, but there's no way in hell I'm gonna put that meat cleaver to my face!" Well guilt got the best of me, I figured the razor looked expensive so I'll give it a go and hope that if I die from blood loss the police will figure out that my death was from shaving with a new razor and it's not from suicide. I'll tell you after a few times shaving with this razor I am now going to retire My Gillette Fuzion. It's takes a bit longer to shave with this razor than with a conventional multi-blade but the results are undeniably better. My wife can't wait to kiss my cheek with school girl glee right after I shave! I have a beard that is as tough as sandpaper and I've never had a closer shave than with this Merkur. I don't have the same spots to go over and over again and therefore my face is less irritated. I use a brush, a glycerin based shave cream and always shave in the shower and that makes a significant difference as well. Factor in that blades for this razor costs so much less then Mach 3 & Fuzion's (I buy cryogenically tempered blades that last 2x longer than store bought) and the way to opt out from expensive razor marketing ploys becomes clear. Don't sit on the fence on this one ditch whatever Mach, to the nth power, razor you're using and pick this Merkur ASAP	1
347075	This camera worked very well until the lens got jammed in its extended position.  I sent the camera for warranty service (I had it less than 7 months), and they refused to honor the warranty because it was a bit scuffed and a little decorative ring on the end of the lens that had been attached with 2-sided tape had come off. They claimed this happened due to physical damage, but this occurred during normal use: I was just changing modes and the lens didn't retract. Don't bother trying to get warranty service unless the unit looks brand new.  Even then, don't be surprised if they renege on the warranty.	0

B00000IRYI:great_attention_grabber!:numom	my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!	1

B0006ZYPCI:nice_but_bright!:bayareakirk	This machine is larger than many ceramic models but nice looking and heats very well. The fan is very quiet. I like that you can use it as a fan without heat as well. My only complaint is that the blue LCD that tells the temperature does not dim or shut off and is VERY bright. Too bright for a bedroom. Really lights it up. I'll be looking for some way of safely masking it. Otherwise very nice but hope it lasts	1
564637	But a good debut album. This is when I felt proud knowin Ja was from ny. No radio friendly s*** here just street for the most part. But i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can't keep talkin about it, which is why i guess he changed his style. Now the subject i wanna hit. Has anyone noticed that guy named progressive? Why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture? And everytime I turn around its some damn rocker/junkie hippie. Last time i checked Rhythm and melody was part of music. I dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock. I'm tired of our music bein trashed. You know what im a go trash one of they "artist" right now	1
B00000K3TK:let's_be_honest_...:sci-fi_guy	This is not a good film.  I wanted to like it because I love South Park and I think that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses.  While it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance, overall it's just not very funny.  I think I laughed twice during the whole film.  Watch it to see the South Park guys "before they were stars", but don't expect much	0
371643	I was looking for some music I could play in the car or around the house with my 19-month-old son and came across this one--the exact same "album" that I had when I was his age!  I'm so glad they redid it!  One of my fondest memories	1
0870032143:pakistan:_between_mosque_and_military:aa	Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time.	0

B0009VEG4Q:tailor_made:j._otoole	Fall through Spring I always carry my R817 in coat pocket when I go out. This jacket fits my camera like a glove. Allows access to all controls and LCD display through clear, heavy duty plastic film, once flap is opened. Open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera. Only time I  zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery, otherwise, I just leave jacket on camera at all times.	1
404011	Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.	0
B0000DJX4G:complete_waste_of_money:momof2	I brought this because  my kids love spongebob & ice cream..perfect toy, right? WRONG!  The ice cream oozes out of all of spongebob's cracks leaving most of it on your table and very little in the cone.  We have to use half a container of ice cream just to make 2 small cones and then I have a huge mess left in the kitchen.	0
B0000789TK:didn't_fit_our_seats,_zippers_broke_on_3rd_use:kelly_castleberry	We own two of these and they have never been easy to use.  We tore holes in the first one trying to insert the seat.  We have kept it though.  We bought another and on our second trip the zippers broke off.  We would not buy this one again.  We do have large carseats - they are both Britax Marathons	0

B0007Z2JMA:terrible_sun_shade:dissatisfied_customer	This was the WORST sunshade ever!!!  Don't waste your money.  It is so flimsy that it offers no sun protection at all.  We used it on our double jogger stroller but it just flopped down into the faces of our babies.   I do not recommend this product.  I only gave it a one star because zero star was not an option	0
B000OYYHXS:did_not_like_the_krzr!!!:dm_"debbi"	FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back	0

B0009R5E50:disappointed:library_girl_"mj"	This software is very hard to use. The help video goes too fast, the manual doesn't cover everything and nothing is intuitive. I have used a lot of software and this is just not worth the money	0
B0002260MI:wonderful_bedtime_bath:a_houston_mommy	This was my first Lush experience and now I am hooked. Something about the scent of this bubble bar relaxes me like nothing else. It didn't smell like hot (coconut) milk to me - it has a warm, spicy, pleasant scent - but it definitely had that "warm milk before bedtime" effect. And it works miracles on my rambunctious two-year-old daughter. Not only does it produce LOADS of bubbles (fwiw we have an oversized clawfoot tub, and a third of a bar filled it to the top w/bubbles) but the scent seems to calm and relax her as much as me. Warning: don't take this bath if you're planning an evening out! You'll just want to snuggle into bed afterwards	1
107927	This book is a very good study into what happen to the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Mr. Capt did a Great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in Assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the Assyrians which is called the House of Omri. This book is very in depth and very informative. I also noticed a person left one star because Mr. Capt did say anything about the Jews. Of course the Jew's wouldn't be metioned they weren't taken into exile until 586 bce, and that was by Babylonia and not Assyria. When reading about the Ten Tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not Jews. Over all I give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid Bible reader intrested in research	1
B000F63TW0:amazing_product:ghetto_diva	A friend of mine used to meet me for lunch while boasting a beautiful & glowing face from a $50.00 facial she had just received.  This product (even after the 1st use) produced the same results & I never had to leave my home.  My skin always goes through hell during the winter months when its continually exposed to artificial heat.  My skin feels & looks like I've lost about 7 years time.  I'm very, very pleased with Olay.  I've used their Total Effects lotion for years & I did purchase the regenerist serum to apply after using the kit.  This is an excellent exfoliant & hands down, the best skin regenerating product I've ever used	1
B000EVMNLY:super_cola_bottles:j._chan	LOVE these!  These are a great treat at any age.  I bagged the giant cola bottles, giant crocs and gummy bears in a treat bag for my 4th grade students.  They were savoring the giant cola bottles.  I don't blame them.  I find myself chomping on them, too.  I don't even like coca cola	1
B00020J1JE:nice_under_$20_watch:ivaylo_v._ninov	I ordered one of these for the time I spend in the gym and on the track running, also it is a good choice if you go swimming every once in a while.	1

B0006TZK6O:great_little_back_up_battery:patti	This battery for my Cannon camera is a great little "back up" battery.  My camera came with a Cannon battery and charging unit.  The replacement Cannon battery sells for over $40.00 so purchasing this CTA battery at less than $10.00 is a very good choice.	1
1414302118:excellent_bible:brandi_r._drury_"bdrury"	This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice	1
B0000E0JDV:this_bed_rail_sucks:jessica_m._cox_"smurfica5"	I don't care what other reviewers say, but this bed rail sucked!!  I used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed.  It took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed.  And it would constantly come unlocked.  And if I buy another bed rail for our next child it won't be a mesh one cause they get too dirty.  I can't remember if this cover was removable or not, if it was I'm sure it would have been a pain in the a** to remove	0
B000G2UCV4:great_product!:j._milner	Good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device.  My major fear was that this would make my 1955 too thick and I would not use it.  It is just right and great protection for my 1955 - by the way I replaced a 4150 with this 1955 and case because my daughter accidently sat on my 4150 and broke the screen.  It is a great piece of protection	1
350963	I purchased this tripod from 47th Street Photo through Amazon.com.  The tripod appeared to arrive in good shape, except that the operating instructions were not included.  I immediately emailed 47th Stree Photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment.  I asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions.  They did not respond to my email, so a few days later I emailed them again.  Once again, no response.  I then emailed Amazon.com, and informed them of the missing instructions and the non-responses from 47th Street Photo.  No response from Amazon either!  As far as the tripod goes, it appears to be a very good value for the money.  I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, due to the missing operating instructions, I cannot be certain I have properly checked out all of its features.  However, I am certain that both 47th Street Photo and Amazon.com rate zero stars for customer service.  I will use neither one again	1

B000B8NFHQ:great_product!:sharon_m._vetsch_"the_quickbooks_queen"	I use this program daily and it is awesome!  It has lots of great new features especially the new home page that has the customer, vendor and employee centers where you can now see all of the information in one place.  The features and functionality of the program are everything any small to mid size business needs to run their company from a financial point of view.  Great improvements over previous versions	1

B000FBWYIU:made_in_china_and_taiwan.___:bill	I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !	0

177598	I do not why the others had these problems with Windows XP. I have run this program since it came out 2001? Except for the danger of attack by viruses, I have had no trouble as long as enough RAM is installed. A minimum of 500-750 is essential. With the addition of antivirus software and service pack 2, I feel fairly secure.	1
B00005NINB:how_dissapointing:s._whiteman_"redcliffs"	On the whole, Bicycling is a huge disappointment. I agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good, but I don't pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two -- I read those in the newstand. Further, as I will mention below, once and a while there is a real gem of an article.	0

408804	Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.	1

B000F4ELZ6:marble_mania:k._tyler	We had a simpler and earlier Quercetti marble run.  This was an upgrade/add-on, and well worth it.  The motorized elevator keeps the action going.  A five year old will need help setting up, but can operate the final run easily.  Safe pieces, easy construction and good directions.  Fun, even for the adults	1
B00007LTII:nice_to_have_but.........:michael_a._arlt	This remasted disc is nice with the bonus tracks and spiffed up sound, but the only way top hear Aoxomoxoa is to find a original W7 (Warner Brothers-Seven Arts) green label vinyl pressing. The CD features the 1971 remix (like the 1989 CD) in which 1/3 of the backing has been stripped like Constanten's prepared backrounds on "What's Become Of The Baby", the extra drums and barbershop vocal on "Doin That Rag". St Stephen lost something in the remix as well. Anthem was remixed as well in 1972 but the band was wise to issue the 1968 mix on CD. No hidden goodies on this disc, but the bonus tracks are great	1

B000BIVK1Y:delighted_but.....:karen_flick_"painter_chic"	This lounge chair (I bought two) exceeded my expectations for quality.  I've been shopping retail stores for months and can tell you that you can't beat this deal!  They are very sturdy and attractive.	1
B0007CXT7M:works_great!:c._krams	This pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels.  The squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes.  I would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound.  I can't hear this noise in the attic, so I will buy another when this wears out.	1
B000067VPA:textbridge_pro_11_is_not_worth_it:gordon_holmes	I purchased this program with the intention of entering a bunch of typewritten pages into my computer.  The document that this program produced from newly typed material was so full of errors that I simply had to re-type.  It would have taken longer to correct than to re-type.  When I talked to Textbridge about these problems all they would tell me is that the program was not meant for such use and that I should buy one of their other programs which had good optical character recognition capabilities.  In other words, they know the product is not any good and they are not willing to stand behind it.  The program is useless for optical character recognition work or anything else	0
6302240948:candiavellian_romp:chester_p._shinaman_"cpswriter"	I have to admit that good writing or not this is one of my favorite escape movies and I wish it would come out in DVD.  My liking it has something to do with John's use of the typewriter and his ability to change the  direction of the characters through the machine.  Once he damages the  typewriter he needs to make a technical sevice call to get it going again.   You can't beat that.  We even get to see a perplexed Robert Wagner and the  rest of a great cast	1

258599	First off you can find this price lots of places.  It is probably the minimum sale price allowed by schwinn.  I choose to buy mine through AMAZON becasue I got 3% back with my visa, free delivery, and didn't pay sales tax.  That made up for most of the cost difference between the 212 and the 213.  I wanted the extra programs.	1
B000EHXWIQ:best_ever:s._lee_harper_"zuni"	Gluten free diets can be so much more varied with this product.  It can be coating to chicken or meat, or can be added to juices/broths to thicken.  It can even be used to make a perfect stuffing for chicken or turkey.	1
B000FRP9WM:casio_-_efa119bk1av:dayton_lawton_"skillz"	I was searching for a watch for weeks, saw a picture of this watch and paused. Intrigued  I began to read the specs: alarm, chronograph, thermometer, light, stopwatch, world-time zones and more, what's the catch? $55USD C'mon seriously with all those features is that all? I was still skeptical but when I got the watch & put it on my wrist I was sold. Solid, well crafted, unique sporty/elegant combination. My only gripe is that slight increase in body temperature can give an innacurate room temperature. We can't have the world but CASIO has come close with this price I can honestly say go for it	1

B0000D14PW:awesome_product!:c._kleinholz	I had this for my daughter when she fit into the baby carrier car seat.  It was awesome.  I never had to worry about blankets falling off or if she was warm enough.  They did tell me at the hospital, however, that if you put anything between your baby and the car seat it voids the warranty on the car seat.  This goes underneath them so it probably does, but I figured it was probably safer than putting a blanket over her anyway	1

509640	Our Ranger Rick issues are used first as reading material, then discussion material, then project material (cut-outs, etc) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much.  Tear out posters line my son's walls. There is no objectionable material in the magazine, just wholesome, fun reading.  No political agenda is discernable from it, which is refreshing. As soon as it comes in the mail, my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through.  The knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day, where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge.	1
B0000032RG:thanks_for_the_non-memories!:anthony_brancato_"generationx187"	Of the dozen tracks featured here, chances are the typical listener will only recognize four: &quot;Signs,&quot; &quot;Sweet City Woman,&quot; &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; and &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot; - and the last-named is out of sequence, having come out more than a year before the others.  The star of this show is Lighthouse's &quot;One Fine Morning,&quot; and Rhino must be praised for offering up the full (LP) version rather than the 45-rpm edit, which was about two minutes shorter.  It's a shame, in a way, that this song had lyrics; had it been an instrumental, it would have found a perfect and permanent home - on &quot;Music From NFL Films&quot; - it had that quality about it.  As for the other eight offerings: If they wanted to pick some obscure stuff, why didn't they go all the way and throw in Dusk's &quot;Treat Me Like A Good Piece Of Candy?&quot	0

It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully.  I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn't Mustela.

I love it!  It's surprising.  It changes.  On me, when I first put it on it takes on a white floral scent.  When I first applied it, I was surprised that it seemed like a floral".. but hours later I was smelling Vanilla.  I was very surprised to realize it was me!  VERY interesting! Very cool!

58673	I hesitated a good while before picking this game up at a bargain price. Based upon various reviews and player feedback, I assumed that this game would be like 10 hours long, a bit buggy, and dumbed down. Fortunately, none of this was the case. I had some good fun with this over a weekend (yes, it can be finished over a weekend) and didn't come across a single bug. Fable is not in the same league as Morrowind, Oblivion, Gothic 2, or some of the other great roleplaying games (RPG) out there, but it does provide an enjoyable diversion.	1

B0001KNHTA:low_quality._:bernard_chapin_"ora_et_labora!"	This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians.	0

435463	Of all the games on the DS, no other third party title has made this good of use of the stylus and touch screen than Atlus' Trauma Center: Under the Knife.  Playing as a young, inexperienced surgeon, you use the stylus to cut, suture, bandage, and more in an effort to save your patients.  You have a certain amount of time to do these tasks, as well as keeping an eye on your patient's vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards and re-starting the heart of a flatliner.  There's a storyline to Trauma Center, but it's only here as a way to make the game move along.  The highlight of the game and what makes it worth picking up is the fact that this is one of the titles that makes the DS the best portable system out there today.  The level of interactivity is inituitive, but the game loses steam because it is ultimately too short.  After completeing each surgery, you'll be able to re-play them to boost your surgeon rating, which is a nice little bonus in itself.  All in all, Trauma Center: Under the Knife is a definite must check out for all DS owners, but keep in mind that the game isn't for everyone	1
B000053VA6:great_for_people_with_not_much_time:a._vegan	If you're looking for a video that doesn't take a lot of time, then this is one that you should add to your collection.  It doesn't matter if you're a beginner or have been doing this stuff for years, there are two levels to suit both challenges.  10 minutes is spent on abs, buns &amp; thighs.  You can choose to do all of them or one of them when you get a spare 10 minutes.  The exercises are great and you can feel the burn in all your muscles.  If you do this video 3-5 times a week and eat a healthy diet, you'll easily lose inches and tighten up those &quot;loose&quot; areas	1

I am using two other Philips/Magnavox remotes that are far more convenient and operate better.  This one does not look like the picture (which looks more like the 425 model).  It does not cover the equipment I have (while the 425 model does), It's learning mode is flaky and unreliable, to say the least. The range is shorter then that of the 425S.

462375	Asimov's provides 11 issues annually, packed with science fiction novellas, novelettes, short stories, poems, book reviews, and editorial articles.  As with any anthology or anthology-magazine, the story quality varies, but there are some true gems.  Alan M. Steele wrote a series of stories for Asimov's, beginning with the wonderful "Stealing Alabama" and including the stunning "The Days Between".  These stories were later combined in the novel "Coyote".  One value of this magazine is to introduce readers to authors they do not know.  Several years ago, George R. R. Martin wrote a short story for Asimov's that I found enthralling.  It turned out to be a portion of Martin's then-upcoming novel, "A Game of Thrones", which is in itself the first in a series of books (now going on four, rumored to be seven overall) called "A Song of Ice and Fire" and that is probably my all-time favorite fantasy series.  Overall, Asimov's is a science fiction buffet; you get a little taste of everything, some of it good (Kage Baker's "Company" series), some of it great (Martin's and Steele's above-mentioned stories), and some of it that you take a bite and leave the rest for the bus-boy (I don't care for Elliot Fintushels' "Izzy" series)	1

B000KE1PBY:baseball_fans_will_enjoy_this_one:christina_brown	'The Curse of the Grebes' is sort of a tribute to the Red Sox return to World Series glory with cameos by Damon, Timlin and Renteria. Timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by Emily Dickinson with remarkable aplomb.

439306	Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.	0
552123	I'm sure that this review isn't unique.  Spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover, not to mention the ridiculous articles written within. By the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound' I've completely forgotten the point of thier article.  They must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing. They sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com. I'm sure that i've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin.  Next time you see it on the stands, I suggest you spin in another direction	0

B000C42MLE:don't_waste_your_money_like_i_did.:j._haller	I purchased the Cyberpad 8.5x11 digital Notepad with the expectation that I would be able to digitize my sketches and notes I made at work. Unfortunately the product did not live up to my expectations. The first unit that I received did not function, the usb connection to the pad was defective (the connector would not insert all the way hone). I returned it and received very promptly a new unit which at least functioned. As far as being functional that is another story. I proceed to try to use the it in either using the memory in the pad itself or using it directly connected to the computer. Either way the unit produced images that were useless. The lines that look fine on the paper pad were incomplete or missing in the digital version. Drawing a straight line was impossible even with the help of a straight edge. I let a friend try to use it and he had similar unsatifactory results. Unless this performance is a function of this manufacturer's design, I would say that this is one technology that is not ready for 'Prime Time'	0

Having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use. You can't go wrong with this super storage block	1

14729	How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding	0

As the most popular and one of the best operating systems, Windows NT series is incredibly complicated, and this magazine, issue after issue as well as on its cluttered website, gives you lots of detailed information.  A lot of the contributors are respected programmers who really know Windows internals.  You also get the "inside" view of Microsoft managers and developers from time to time.  This is just one incredible resource for expert Windows uers.  (After all, even an expert still has a lot to learn.)	1

489837	When I was little, my dad always said good things about this magazine.  My attitude was always &quot;I'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - I mean, c'mon, it's a history magazine.  I was absolutely wrong.  I picked up this magazine one day and I was hooked.  I would say that American Heritage has found its way to make history interesting.  One way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles.  On the second thought, I should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not.  This magazine keeps me awake - sometimes I would put my paper/project aside just so that I could finish my copy in one sitting.  It's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months.  American Heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself	1

B00097DXY4:"born_to_kill_(1947)_..._robert_wise_..._rko_radio_pictures_film_noir":j._lovins_"mr._jim"	RKO Radio Pictures present "BORN TO KILL" (1947) (92 mins/B&W) (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Starring Claire Trevor, Lawrence Tierney, Walter Slezak, Audrey Long & Phillip Terry --- Directed by Robert Wise and released in May 3, 1947, our story line and film, Uncompromising film noir which sees psychopath Tierney marry wealthy girl Long, only to feel more in common with the black sheep of the family, his wife's sister (Trevor). Deliciously dark and directed with enthusiasm by Wise before he'd made it big, Born to Kill is a genuine oddity which explores the dark side of sexuality without moralizing, with the bonus of a cracking murder plot to add some spice. Tierney pitches his performance just right ... The film sits well with all those minor noir classics the late 40's and early 50's with apparent ease: Wise's own "The Set-Up"; Anthony Mann's "Raw Deal" and the "T-Men", "Kiss Of Death", and Ray's masterly debut, "They Live By Night".	1

B0006J31WO:big_fan_of_clic_products_disappointed_with_clic_sport_google_:brad_q._post	I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!	0

It seems like the flavor of roiboos itself is pretty mild, and in the case of Tazo's tea, the flavors they add completely overwhelm it.  I found that I had to remove the tea bag very quickly lest the cup become overwhelmingly lemony and acidic.  Perhaps other pallettes will appreciate the strength of those flavors.  Personally, I couldn't wait to finish off the box so that I could find a better flavor.	0

The black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. Part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. And the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.	0

554104	All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid (& underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!	1
537070	They are books like those written by Stephen Ambrose which keep the flame of my interest in reading of times and events of long ago burning. Some have accused Ambrose of taking too many liberties with the facts. To those I would say, Bah Humbug! This book is well written and worthy of the readers time, unless, of course, you are a "fact-checker", in which case the original sources, to the extent they even exist, might be more to your liking.  For Orginary Joe's, like me, Mr. Ambrose has provided a good deal of reading entertainment and information. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be transported in time and place to the high plains during the Indian Wars	1

Cleaning this is quick and easy. The small parts get clean by simply placing in hot,soapy water in the sink. I plan on using this a lot.	1
345843	At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.	0

102490	The casting for this production could scarcely be better (of particular note is the harrowing performance of Judi Dench) and it's one of Shakespeare's best plays. That said, this film of a production on stage doesn't quite carry the viewer's interest for the entire play. There are times when the actors seem downright pretentious; you feel as if they're tellings us, "We know how deep this is so appreciate it, please." That's too bad since "Macbeth" is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film. Sadly, this relatively slow-moving production isn't it. There are, of course, wonderful moments with Mackellan and particularly Dench (no one plays the scene where Lady Macbeth goes crazy better than Dame Judi). I just don't know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase. For my money, Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood" is a far better choice.	0

6301972252:the_eye_of_morning:a._sebastian_catala_"chany_catala"	Mata Hari arrived in Paris and soon began to spin a web of sorcery. Her naked body (that same body that was later to be riddled with bullets)her password to a greedy world of material success.Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod enjoyed a happy childhood in Holland the darling of a dotting father. Early restlessness brought her to Java, the mail-bride of a brute. There, in Indonesia, amid crushing tragedy and spousal abuse, Gertie absorbed the artistic concepts that will one day found her applauded, then, mowed down by a French firing squad. Poor judgment, and Eastern flair, and a gluttony for men, contrived to make her eternal. But was Gertie a spy? The visionary Irving Thalberg secured the rights to Mata Hari's notebooks and thus MGM began production starring Greta Garbo. I find this 1932 film a work of contrasts. To watch Garbo mise-en-scene through the lens of William Daniels, in a genial atmosphere assembled by Cedric Gibbons, rapturous, is truly a fine thing. MGM's 'Mata Hari' remains a unique accomplishment. Though one wonders how the silly story-theme ever passed Thalberg. There is a dichotomy here, style versus substance (a chronic blemish with some of Garbo's films) The developing narrative is puerile, and mind you, the early thirties boasts many a gritty film. More than an actress Garbo is a virtuosa, a poseur. Thus she offers art more priceless, a curious and singular spiritual apogee, such pulchritude and distinction. Watch her shoulders ache suddenly as she plays piano en-scene, as her stock-in-trade matinee idol grasps her from behind wantonly. Watch her match wits with Lewis Stone, tonight her spy-master. Watch Garbo in the third act climb the hospital stairs Adrian head-to-toe. Watch her watch her. But! if I hear Ramon Navarro one more time call her "...Mata!" I think I'd croak (her name is M-A-T-A-H-A-R-I) How many times I've seen 'Mata Hari' I'm ashamed to say. The last viewings have been in the wee hours where there reigns a sad and profound solitude. On cue Greta emerges, like Cybele, to temporarily soothe my ills. Soon, I hear a halting viola: "...I come to you Si-va! like the bayaderes dance in your sacred temples in Java...!" Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari	1

B000EMU1K8:possibly_the_worst_software_i've_encountered:amorteur	This thing is a nightmare. First, it is impossible to understand unless you already know how to run some other comparable system. Next, it requires a huge amount of fiddling with buffers (believe me -- read the help files on this, which are huge and suggest ten different things to do when your music doesn't sound good, and trust me, it won't, either before or after unlimited tweaking). Finally, it actually does not export as it says it does. It lost my files, including one song I cannot quite reproduce (gone forever). Bottom line: If your idea of fun is spending two weeks of vacation fiddling with software that does not work and will never work, then by all means, buy this garbage. I have been using computers since 1985, and this is, I think, the worst single product I've ever seen. On the other hand, if you want to actually make music, you might want to try Sony's ACID Pro 6, which you can try out for free (the company thinks you'll like it, whereas the sadists at Cakewalk must know perfectly well that you won't, hence no demo).	0

414947	The problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well.  The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation.  Why could the equation not be solved?  There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book.  Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.  The reason is the subject of Galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one	0

B00007FY4H:great_time_at_the_lake:laura_a._terrall_"new_mom"	We looked everywhere for this float after borrowing one while swimming at the lake with our 11 month old.  The nice thing about it is that it provides a safe and comfortable ride while allowing the child to be right in the water and splash around.  We can swim right alongside and spin him around or swim underneath to come and suprise him from the other side.  We don't have to worry much about the water being too deep because the float is so stable.  I would say the only drawback is that while it inflates fairly easily, squeezing all the air out and collapsing the float can take a few tries.  I would recommend this product to anyone with an older baby who wants to take their child for a float in calm water	1
47414	While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past.

I don't even know where to begin with this one. What can you say about somebody who poses for an album cover in rainbow-painted panties while licking a heart-shaped lolli-pop? And the foldout poster of her reclining on pink satin sheets with said lolli-pop is downright laughable. Does she expect anyone to take her seriously? After her first album, I thought Carey had a remarkable talent that needed some fine-tuning, particularly in regard to her penchant for singing cliches. Instead of getting better, though, she has turned her career into a self-debasing fantasy of baby-doll mannerisms coupled with relentlessly monotonous song choices. Rappers like Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott and Usher are brought in to add spice, but they only drown in the sticky-sweet syrup of gunk that she chooses to sing. She may have a lot of #1 hits, but who can tell any of them apart? Rainbow is only Carey's latest entry in a career that has lowered the quality standard for divas everywhere.	0

163228	Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.	0
184536	The old DVD from 1997 looks better than the new HD version. I've compared the two, and the first DVD had good color saturation, dark blacks and looked right with the heavy red and brown palette.

The sound quality is better now, though, and the image of course is higher resolution.	0

I used it pretty consistently the first two weeks and didn't notice any difference in my skin.  I wouldn't recommend this product, unless a dermatologist specifically tells you to use it.	0
294962	Note: If you don't want to know how the movie ends, don't read this. (I'm giving you fair warning now, so don't complain about spoilers later). The only reason I'm mentioning the ending and the "big secret" is because I'd like to spare you from the huge disappointment I experienced when watching this movie.                        When I first walked into the theatre to see this, I couldn't have been more excited; after months of waiting, I'd finally get to see the movie whose preview had given me chills every time I saw it! The movie started out wonderfully: great acting, scenery that could go from gorgeous to terrifying in a matter of seconds, and, at times, almost unbearable suspense (that Shyamalan really knows how to scare!)The story takes place in a small town in the 1800's. At first this town seems like the perfect place to live: the people are friendly, the houses are cozy, and the scenery is beautiful. Despite the peaceful setting, however, we get the feeling that something sinister lies beneath the surface of this sweet little community, something that frightens the villagers and keeps them from  being completely at ease. Every now and then, they glance fearfully at the forest surrounding the village; nobody ever ventures into it, and a guard is stationed every night to watch over it. Pretty soon, we find out why: according to the village elders, there are dangerous, hostile creatures lurking in the woods that will kill anyone who dares enter their domain. These creatures are supposedly unidentified monsters who are so bloodthirsty that the color red is forbidden in the village (it attracts them). For years, the villagers and the monsters have had an understanding: as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, the monsters will not harm them. At one point,however, one of the creatures enters the village at night, leaving the villagers to believe that their uneasy truce may soon come to an end and more of the creatures will attack. While all this is happening, we (the audience) still don't know what the creatures look like and half the suspense comes from wondering what they really are. It was halfway through the movie when all my hopes for the story came crashing to an end: There are NO MONSTERS IN THE WOODS.  When one of the villagers revealed a monster costume and said the shocking words "It's all a farce", I still couldn't believe what I was hearing; it was all I could do to keep myself from screaming right there in the theatre! After months of anticipating this film, of expecting a truly scary thriller, and of trying to guess what the monsters really are, THERE ARE NO MONSTERS! Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe it. It got worse, though. The next big surprise was the reason the villagers created the story of the "monsters". The villagers aren't really living in the 1840's; they're living in a modern-day wildlife reserve. Supposedly, the leaders of the village used to live like normal modern people, but when tragedy struck their families, they decided the real world was too much for them and moved into a wildlife reserve to start a new (if extremely delusional) life. The story of the monsters in the forest was created to terrify their children and keep them from wandering too far and discovering the truth. They even had the village retard dress in a costume and wander around occasionally to scare the other children and make them believe the monsters were real! When the retarded boy died in the woods (still wearing the stupid costume), the leaders, rather than mourning him, remorselessly saw it as another opportunity to lie to their children by telling them he was killed by one of the creatures. I basically went from sympathizing with the characters to being repulsed by them. What parents could lie to their children and deliberately terrify them like that? I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a movie before; not only was it completely misleading, but the plot was pitiful and the adult characters were pathetic (I'm sorry, but I have no other word for people who are perfectly happy to live a lie and deliberately frighten and traumatize their children to continue living it). Many fans of this movie have said that those of us who didn't like it "don't get it". I assure you, I did get it, and I didn't like it anyway. I'm no fan of slasher films and I didn't expect this to be one, but I also don't appreciate false advertising or almost totally unsympathetic characters. The two stars are for the cast and the filming. Better luck next time, guys	0

The ring seems to keep it's shine with no maintanence required. As usual the service and delivery at Amazon.com is second to none.

0708945082:terrible.:james_yanni	OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.	0
B00000DI10:classic_wynton--brilliant,_clear_trumpet_renditions:barbara_h._holaday_"azwolflady_bobbie"	For anyone who loves trumpet music as I do, this album is a must.  Wynton Marsalis has mastered twenty all-time favorite pieces with such brilliance, that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison.  Opening with J. Clarke's, The King's March, Wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as Purcell's Entrada from "The Indian Queen," J. Clark's The Prince of Denmark's March and J. Stanley's Trumpet Voluntary.  Fantastic selections from Bach, Mozart, and Haydn follow, with the album also including such delightful listening as The Last Rose of Summer, Carnival of Venisee, and Flight of the Bumblebee.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase	1

Andre Nickatina (in the rapping world) is one of the worst i've ever heard, but if you're into dope beats and his style in flowing with them (reminds me of someone on the ocean just being carried by waves, paddling every which way to stay with them), and what i mean by that is he tries to keep up with the pace and the beat and says (what feels like) every single thing that pops into his head from coke to what he had for dinner that night.  But overall, "if you can't dig it like its shovelled man i guess you ain't able" summs this and the rest of the Nickatina c.d.s up	0

B00005219O:not_a_real_nikon:alb	I bought this in August 2005, when the original battery that came with my Nikon Coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  On the page I ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine Nikon battery, however, when I received it, it was not.  It was made in Taiwan, and does not have the Nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as I remember).  This battery has never held a charge well.  It's about as bad as the original battery is now, and I've only had it a few months.  Maybe I just got a lemon--but I'd recommend you buy a genuine Nikon, if you can find one	0

B00021E3W8:the_inside_scoop...:vintage-noir	I am actually an employee for L'Occitane (pronounced Lox-ee-tahn; that's the question i get asked every day! lol). I have only been working for the company at their Santa Barbara store for about 2 weeks, and this is what I've learned about the Artemesia Shampoo: This IS the shampoo that ALL Four Season's Carry. The packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country, but this is the ONLY shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me, but TRUST me- they train us on which one it is).  People come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons.  In fact, the company SOLD OUT and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in Santa Barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it.  The scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. Some other products you might want to try out? The four Seasons also carrys our Verbena Shea Soap, Verbena body lotion, and our Lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). Also, just to let you know, this week we're getting new products for our Honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- I'm HOOKED) including a cleanser, milk bath, and honey massage nectar. Hope this information helps some of you- Enjoy!	1

147340	Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed.	0

Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem	1

This sounds like Steven Curtis Chapman or Michael W. Smith or any of the other mass produced Christian/pop music artists.  On all of his previous albums, even though he changed his sound slightly, it was still generally very acoustic and Bebo-ish.  This album sounds nothing like his previous music.  I was disappointed.	0

B00007GWBX:battery_schmattery:spinner_"casual_propellerhead"	I had high hopes for this battery for my Nikon camera.  It promised more MAH than the OEM battery that came with the camera.  Unfortunately, it must be leaking electrons all over the place, since a charge in this model does not compare to the original.  I would guess that the charge lasts half the life of the original Nikon battery.  The price was cheap and you get what you pay for.  If you are going to purchase this one, get two since you'll need to keep one charging while using the other.  Cheers	0
96246	I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer.

492640	The earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked bands from the 90s.  Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often, however, if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock.  Yes, rock.  Who knew it could still be done, and believe me, they do it well, and uniquely.  If you've listened to Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album.  It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but not as fast or dirty as Raise.  Now, if you have never listened to Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes.  Personally, I would suggest starting with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over.  Sadly, this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack Highway).  But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must	1

B000B4SVM4:better_than_expected.:q._stephens_"mommy_of_2"	Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow.  My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product.  At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing.  I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.  I would say my money is well spent	1
B000BPMS36:nice_weather_station:william_w._davis_"famousdavis"	Our old General Electric indoor/outdoor thermometer's outdoor sensor broke this summer, so it was time to replace it with a weather station that could give more info about the weather than just the temp.  I live in South Florida, and it's nice to know what the heat index is, because in the summer, our temps along the coast rarely rise above 90 degrees, but the heat index rarely is below 100 (in which case I choose the indoor treadmill over running outside).	1
B0009E7AVY:don't_buy_it....:kp	Hi, I bought this camera and installed the driver from both the CD and then the web.  It caused my computer (a good, modern, fast computer) to crash both times.

The tech support when I had these problems was HORRIBLE.  They really didn't stand behind the product AT ALL and to me that's the most important thing!  Maybe I could have gotten it to work, but not without SOME input from Aiptek.	0

I've found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money. As someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often.  I specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason, with an inexpensive digital scale, which is what I had last, you can't reset it like you can an analog.

B000A0QQRQ:all-around_best_razor:joseph_dipietro	Having shaved with everything from cheapo disposables to Thiers-Issard straight razors, I have to say that the Merkur Progress is probably the best all-around razor available today. It has excellent heft and balance, and the adjustment feature is simple and straightforward. (Although I do agree that the numbered adjustment seems to perform a little differently depending on the blade used.) It is easy to keep clean--assuming you don't mind unscrewing it and taking the blade out to wipe off the head and frame. Having also used a venerable old Gillette "fat boy" from the 1950s, I'd still have to rate the Progress as a better razor; the screw operated adjustment makes it constantly adjustable, not just in steps.	1

We are redoing our deck and expanding it, and after research thought this would be the best buy for a durable product.  After reading the shipping complaints, we put it on order right away- expecting to have it in the several weeks it would take for the deck.  Lo and behold- 3 days later they call my wife and ask to deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks the next morning and the next day when i get home there are 4 giant boxes in my garage spot when i get home.  They are huge boxes, and double boxed, but luckily no styrofoam- still i had to take all the cardboard to the recycling center myself, but at least very little was not recycleable.  Our deck is still not done, so i can make little comment other than that the one i did set up in the living room seems study- the cushion is very thick and well made- but stiff- which may be the comment noted below (I assume he goes for very soft).  I find it comfortable, but may comment more when we have actually used them a bit.  Still given the shipping concerns noted is several comments, I wanted to point out that if you have someone who can be home for a four hour window- it seems to be no problem.	1

6305837821:prelude_to_what_could_have_been:brandy_miller	Truly his greatest film I have seen thus far.  Not only is one taken in by this movie, but it allows one to forget that it's filmed in black and white.  The boy, Elvis, of course, is even more beautiful in KING CREOLE.  Which leads me to believe he believed in his work for this picture.  The soundtrack is admirable.  He delivered it with such effervescence, such pride.  One can't help but fall in love with him and this movie.	1
B000225ZW4:nice_but_not_my_favorite:kw	like all lush shampoo cakes, it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy. I find the smell to be nothing to write home about. Yes, my hair was shiny, but it tends to be with all of their products. Don't be scared of the glitter though, it's barely there.....all in all, I prefer New and Karma Komba to this one.	1
B000MTRNQS:cell_phone_cover:april_m._cheek	I really like this case!  It is easy to put on and take off.  It does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen.  It does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and I think it makes my phone easier to hold.  I would like for more colors.  I would really like for something to glow in the dark, so that I could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse.	1
59299	I've been reading Foreign Affairs since 1980 and have always admired the well rounded scope covering everything from Social & Cultural issues, Media/Public Opinion, International law, Human rights, Economics, Trade & Finance, Science & Technology, Intelligence, Energy, resources & environment, International organizations, and the list goes on.	1
292134	Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.	0
166454	I got this book when it first came out and read it straight away.I absoloutely loved it and highly reccomend it.Lief is trying to be a great ruler, but can't, not with the famine and death in Deltora.But with a perilious map, our heroes set out to destroy the four sisters that are causing the deaths in Deltora.An exceptional addition to the previous books and is reccomended to fans who want a little more adventure in their reading.Well done Emily Rodda!I like this book as much as all the others, this is the best Deltora series and I say it proudly, but after all, Deltora Quets hasn't finished, not yet	1
B000GHVZQ0:nothing_quite_like_it:harry_pandolfino	I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it.	1
B000BSW9ZA:don't_buy_it:c._segal_"cs74"	Have received and reviewed this item. I cranked it for 2 minutes. The radio played no longer than 2-3 minutes then died. I tried to crank it longer - same results. It is useless. It's large and bulky (though very sleek and nice). The cranking handle looks fragile and I suspect with all the cranking this toy needs, it will break sooner than later. Bottom line: Don't buy it. I own another similar product which has a simple look however the radio plays for at least one hour on a 1 - 2 minutes crank	0

0553589482:must_love_dogs_and_cheesy_romance:robert_b._harris	Do you like romance novels? Do you call your dogs your babies? This is the book for you. The thriller aspect of this book is far overshadowed by the romance portion, and the annoyingly repetitious mentioning of the dog could possibly drive most readers over the edge. This was my first Johansen novel, and it most certainly will be my last. Two stars for actually wrapping up the story without leaving too many loose ends.	0
B000EPFCC2:same_problem_as_others,_sticks_to_glass...then_won't_stick:bcindc	I bought my wife a Nuvi 350 for her birthday last August (overall, we love the Nuvi, but the mount...no). The biggest "advantage" of the Nuvi over other GPS systems is its portability. Unfortunately, the suction cup appears to have been designed to subvert this feature. The cup sticks to the first window it is attached to very well...and then won't let go. When we tried to transfer it (after being attached only a couple of days), it left pieces of itself to the windshield and was very difficult to reattach to another windshield (though with difficulty and repeated tries, we have been able to move it).	0
B0002UCSKI:norton_internet_security_is_appalling:a._rieple	I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all.

I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load.	0
301086	The cover of this book compares it to The Kite Runner, so it caught my attention.  I honestly could not stop reading as "Yasmina Khadra" does an amazing job of making believable and likeable characters.  He weaves a tale of how terrible situations eat away at people's humanity.	1

140733	I picked this monitor after reading many reviews.  The reviews didn't lie.  This monitor does great on distance.  I have a 2400 sq ft home that has 3 floors.  The bedrooms are on the 3rd floor and most of my housework ended up on the 2nd floor.  I can have this on while vacuuming and still hear my son cry or even move around when he would wake up and not make a sound.  I could hear him grunt even!  I don't know why the one review mentions a 15ft signal loss.  You're given many channels in order to find the right strength.  I could go outside of my home and walk approximately 10 ft away from the garage door and still have signal (he was on opposite end of house upstairs).  I also took the receiver in the shower a couple of times, not getting it soaked.  Also like the voice activated portion but that only works if the room or surrounding area has no sound (no radio or tv or mobile playing).  Great product, strongly recommend.  My son is now 5 months old and the monitor still works great.  This monitor is the right choice for the average household.  Interference may come if you're on the same channel. I have wifi network, cordless digital phones and nextels and do not have any interference with this monitor so others just don't know how to resolve thier issue before blaming the product	1

B000IMWI3M:i_would_give_this_infinite_stars...:ignacio_gonzalez_"aspiring_writer"	This stuff is sooo great. This three-pack set gives you the creme de la creme in men's skincare. The shampoo is wonderful and actually prevent hair loss. The body wash is my favorite...its smells awesome. The after shave is fantastic...soothing and refreshing. I suggest this pack for those who've never used Billy Jealousy or those loyal followers such as myself...this is also a great was for someone to get introduced to Billy Jealousy, this has all the essentials. You will not be displeased, in fact you'll be in awe...you'll be compelled to tell everyone, this also makes a great gift. Billy Jealousy is the absolute best and I've used all upscale lines from department stores, Sephora, and spas...and this stuff is the best	1

566447	If you've missed your favorite pastas because of your low-carb diet, this definitely is the product for you. Though it doesn't have the starchy quality of pasta, it's a convincing substitute if you're don't mind sacrificing texture for a low-calorie, low-carb meal. Be sure to drain adequately before you top with a sauce, otherwise you end up with a slimy mess. Otherwise, I would recommend this product to anyone who misses pastas because of Atkins, South Beach, etc.	1

B000AMCAUG:very_cool!:s._furst	This is an attractive 10" clock, white face, silver bezel (also available with black). The unique feature is the ability to synchronize with the atomic clock (WWWVB) in Ft. Collins, CO. Watching the hands speed around the dial as it initially sets itself is worth the price of the clock in itself. We bought one for a play room and liked it so much we bought two more.	1

B00006HOE3:unreliable_discs:	I burn about 50 CDs a week in live music trades.  I can tell you from experience that these discs do not last.  After a year or so, they start to skip more and more and have all sorts of problems.  Any scratches that they have only make it worse.  I recommend using Sony, Fuji, or TDK.  All the others are cheaply made in comparison and just don't stand the test of time.  So if you care about preserving your CDs, don't use these ones	0
123365	First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.	1

I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards	0

015693521X:ugh:k._a._mancuso	Talk about taking the joy out of an experience.  I read this book prior to a week-long trip to Venice.  This book quite simply accomplished none of its objectives.  It is a poor &quot;guidebook&quot; and is poorly written and uninteresting in terms of a travelogue.  The history and art of Venice are covered better in books from those genres.  The only upside is that it is short.  Yuck, what a waste of time.  My advice is:  get a novel about Venice if you like novels, a guidebook if you want that, an art book, or a history book.  At least you'll get something out of those--this one tries all of these and fails.  Actually, in terms of a travelogue, &quot;Vendela in Venice&quot; far surpassess any other Venice book I have seen.  Although I originally bought it because it is considered a children's book, it is not dumbed down at all and adults will enjoy it...	0

This product came fast as lightning, and as I read in the other review, the sticks were inconsistant, but I can't complain. We received a pack of 16 sticks, more than advertised. They are obviously not professional quality, but great for practice. My son goes through drumsticks like mad, and these are lasting just as long as much more expensive sticks, bought at our local Music store.	1
0679806830:poignant_story:j._collyer	The Snow Goose is a beautifully written book that lingers in the memory long after the hour or so that it takes to read.  Set on the coast of England at the time of Dunkirk, it is less about the strife of WWII itself than about its three main characters - one of whom is the snow goose - and what binds them.  It is a story about nature, love, and nobility of spirit.  To say more would be to give too much away.  But it has had a place on my bookshelf for decades, and I reread it when I need to be reminded what is important in life	1

599112	In 1980 Michael Weiner saw the publication of Weiner's Herbal: The Guide to Herb Medicine, which states the medical benefits of marijuana [7]. However he recently stated that the chemicals in marijuana make it too dangerous to be used as medicine. On his program, he strongly cautions against the recreational use of marijuana, occasionally devoting his show to "marijuana horror stories" and its claimed potential to ruin lives. He has authored a number of other books on various herbal medicine topics under this name. More recently, Savage's books are political in nature and published by WND Books, a partnership between the conservative website WorldNetDaily and Thomas Nelson, a publisher of Christian books.	0

Wayne is not afraid to experiment, he skillfully combines old school elements with new in such a natural way.

Well, if you are going to shop online, you'd better learn to read the specifications for products!  I came to Amazon precisely because I knew I'd be able to find what I needed, for less.  Texas has no State income tax, so I make sure that I buy Turbo Tax for Federal only.	1

73390	I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine.	1

B00009V7RN:no_wit,_no_fire,_no_fun:r._moore_"bobbym"	As a lover of gospel bluegrass I anticipated an enjoyable listening session with Blue Highway's latest offering. Let me first say that I am a fan of this group, which I consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom, but what I heard was bluegrass Muzak. Yes, the group's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence, and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller, but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing. Gospel music, even bluegrass Gospel, has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves. A good Gospel recording MUST have some cuts which are humorous, some serious and contemplative, some that push the envelope of orthodoxy, and most importantly it must have an element of FUN in order to keep the attention of the listeners. This disc fails in that regard containing standard old Gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards. My advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new, or buy used. Want mine	0

B000KJS8CI:pretty_good_phone_but_questionable_quality:james_f._haun_"jim_haun"	After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering.	0
B00009KX0J:pretty_coolio:jo-sette_b._miller	This game is very exciting for my son, he is five, I am teaching him to read his blends and this is a great reinforcer. I enjoy watching him do the math (one with the coins) as well as watching him make words.	1
B00006J9RF:simply_terrible:musiqcritiq_"lonestarstudios"	what a shame.  c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice.  maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears.  more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse.  hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.  that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood.  very sad	0
B00009R6SD:low_price,_high_quality:rick_fortenberry_"sandpiper_guitar_studios"	I was looking for a pair of roof-prism binoculars like this, for hawk and bird watching. I had looked at Swarovskis, but they were way out of my budget, nearly a thousand dollars for this resolution.	0
B000143SZY:just_how_you_want_your_hair_to_look!!!:s._winkler	Ever since my curlers arrived I have been obsessed. I love the curls I get from the larger size. Just roll your hair when you wake up, do your make, eat breakfast, and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers (very painless) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials. I love this product!!!	1
B0007CZK6K:simply_nice:d._kennedy	These are basic, simple earrings of exceptional quality given the price.  You would likely pay far more for comparable items elsewhere	1

46937	There are not many magazines specializing in political commentary that are really any good these days. So many of them are geared toward a political party, instead of concentrating on the issues that are most important. "Reason" magazine is the exception, and with its motto that a "free mind implies a free market" and vice versa, it has proven to be a publication that one can count on for objective analysis under the umbrella of that motto. The authors who write for it definitely have their biases, but they are attentive to these biases, and usually anticipate and answer objections to the ideas on which they expound.	1
B000AF3Q8S:great_product:a._clark	We love this product. It was easy to set up and it's great knowing what time it is without having to turn a light on. The only thing I don't like is the alarm, it's very annoying.	1
B000088NO4:dlync_video_phone_1000:james_scheuer	Setting this unit up has been impossible, and I have not been able to use it.  I have sought help of Dlync website, dlynk phone support.  The have not been able to work me through it.  I have paid for a machine I cannot use, have spent countless hours on phone and computer in trying to set it up.  Another person who has the same system with which I wanted to communicate has had the same problem and cannot use hers	0
B000BH4GUC:you_won't_get_hot_coffee_with_this_piece_of_[....]:p._mitchell	I purchased this coffee maker and in three months time, threw it out. What a piece of [....]. You can NEVER get a decent HOT cup of coffee (it is lukewarm at best) and the carafe not only breaks, so you have to replace it, but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup. What a dissapointment this machine is. Mr. Coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee, but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. The only nice thing I can say about it is the programmable timer worked.  I would not give this coffee maker one star, but that was the lowest rating available. If it were up to me, I would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating!	0

457317	I am so happy that there is a market for this magazine. The mantra of the book is dead people is thwarted by this pub. I scribble down scores of books each issue that I have to read and it reawakens my interest in books that I missed when they feature classics. I buy more books than ever now thanks (or maybe no thanks) to this magazine	1
0929173112:get_this_and_get_better!:full_moon	Whenever my eczema flared up, my friends would tell me I'm too stressed out.  I didn't feel that way, not much more stressed out than usual, so the timing of the flare ups and the stress level at that time was sometimes confusing.	1
404940	This device is useless for monitoring pulse during activity.  One must be absolutely still for the meter to get a clear signal.  Nor is it useful for monitoring resting pulse, as it seems unable to pick up a pulse unless the heart is pounding.  At best, this device MIGHT manage to acurately read a pulse AFTER a strenuous activity is concluded	0
B00070HKU6:works_well,_easy_to_use:g._castelo	I purchased this for my teenager to use with her IPod Nano. I shopped around for a while before I finally decided on this one because it came with losts of accesories and she uses it everyday all the time and says it works perfectly. I've only had it for a month but it's holding up in the hands to a teen and no complaints so far.	1
B0009JKI3G:seatcover_review:olivia_j._benjamin_"op10s04"	The seat covers are cute, but only 1 comes in a box and while I was putting them in my car one of them ripped! Obviously the quality is not very good	0

B000F4H74I:eh:dani_arteri	I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this	0
B0001WXTF0:stay_away_from_this_device.:m._moss	I read the other reviews, some glowing, others well.. not so glowing.  The price was right, ($149 - 50 rebate) So I thought I would take a chance.  I read the other reviews so I have no one else to blame but myself.	0

B00006I5KQ:almost_excellent:a._welles	This mount is nicely designed and well-made; it fit the TV perfectly.

B000CNCAOO:not_the_swimming_mermaid:w._sammons	I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before	0
B000684DKO:broke_on_first_use:d._mirsky_"go_ducks!"	I wish I had read the customer reviews before purchasing this. My wife just tried to use our Kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries. Do not purchase this egg slicer! It is a waste of $10	0
B00005BSM3:doesn't_fit_every_tub:carolyn_alves_"rhale1100"	I had to return this item because it was too short for the side of my tub.  I would have to kneel on the knee pad to make it stretch and then sometimes the elbow pad would pop off.  I ended up trying it by just removing the stretch fabric and elbow pad, but then it became just an expensive knee stool.  The knee stool portion of this product was the only useful part to me and that is why I give it 2 stars rather than 1.  I returned it because you can get just the kneel stool from other companies for half the price	0

B000BN7Q3U:i_do_not_recommend_this_high_chair!!_:c._williams_"dissatisfied_mom"	I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product!	0
B00021DSHO:saved_my_lips!:betka	This has to be by far one of the best lip treatments on the market.  Pricy...yes.  But well worth every cent.  In as few as two uses my lips have gone from cracked to whole.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Lemon...brownsugar..like the body scrub of the same name.	1

DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM!!	0
B000EQHJI6:piece_of_crap:tanya,_"mom_to_3_girls"	I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  She played the sound game.  She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect.  The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing.  Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun.  After trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was, she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again.  I took the thing back to the store and got a refund	0
B000BYRCEW:not_funny:zach_everson	The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either.	0
B00000IZKX:why_is_this_even_being_produced_anymore?:automated_message_"estrusone"	A torture device disguised as a toy. How would you like to spend all day playing on the stairwell? Might as well go lick some dirty socks. I think my dog actually used to drag its bottom along the stairs to relieve a recurring rash. Hey, Ma, why does Slinky go down but not up? Who's the genius who found this at the scrapyard? Most toys in the 1970s relied on mankind's perverse craving for repetition and/or irritation	0
B000EYF7YQ:not_golden_tee:john_robert_wade_jr.	I am now the laughing stock of my friends, why because I payed money for the lamest excuse of a 8 bit console tv plug and play ever.  My atari plug and play has better graphics and feel than this.  There are bars that have the projected GTEE screen that makes the game all most real I feel my little tv had to much resolution for this toy making it feel not so real in fact in two words "it sucks".	0
B0006IRSP6:difficult_to_use:eleanor_lin	I am not too happy with this item.  It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot.  It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out.  And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use.  Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well	0

B0007TIYDE:simply_the_best_residential_phone_system_i've_used:jon_lamphier_"tech_geek_lawyer"	I gave a detailed review of the base system, but the handset merits comments separately.  I have purchased handsets for every room in the house, and because I don't like using the clip to carry it with me everywhere, I use them.  They're easily customizable through the PC interface, although they can be customized without it as well.  Each handset gets its out name, so transferring calls or paging a handset is simple.  (No more trying to remember which room has the "fifth" handset.)  I've been impressed with both the battery life and the range of each handset; I've read reviews that criticized the range or sound quality, but I've had no trouble with either despite a few different usage scenarios.  If you're shopping for one of these, then you've already got the base unit or are considering purchasing it, so you know the quality to expect.  I think the Uniden CLX485 is the best residential phone system I've ever experienced; the handset lives up to that standard, too	1
B00021VGPK:lenin_is_dead,_long_live_the_prince!:ydnar_the_horrific_"rws"	Sing in me oh muse on this snow day, and let me proclaim the many virtues of this fine tea. The scent and flavor of this tea are as close to my conception of ambrosia as anything else that has yet crossed my palate. It is full without being overbearing, it is seasoned without being overpowering. It's great with anything from English breakfast fare to hardy curry.	1

B0009F5B7S:a_must_have_baby_item!:erica_white	I love my New Native sling! I have used it so many times and find it very easy to use and very versatile.  My baby is a very chubby guy and at 9 months he is 24 pounds and still fits in the sling.  He loves it too, whenever we are out shopping or even at home and he is a little fussy I put him in the sling and he calms right down and snuggles in.  I've even nursed while walking around..in many places: Costco, Disneyland, Walmart! Very discreet.  I also love the fact that it is small enough to fold up and put in my diaper bag, so I always have it.  No bulky rings or padding.  I'm buying them for all my family with babies! I love it, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.  A must have item!	1

It wsn't always like that when i got it i would bring it to school then everyone started getting one even kindergarners had one then the princble banned them because one third grader lost hers. During class kids would ask me do you want to connect? Im just saying this is a toy for little ones. This toy can also get repetative i mean its a baby then it gets a tooth ache toddler teen adult old person.

0071470158:not_for_beginners:gray_fox	This book is very dissapointing. Sure, this book is full of information, but does not know how to teach. This book is not completely written in step by step method. Before you actually start touch your project, you are fed up with information. I even found a couple of mistakes in earlier chapter. DVD comes with this book, but this DVD is not a lesson project like Apple Pro Training Series. Not useful.	0

B00004DSG5:a_potty_training_must_have!!!:michelle_neese_"michelle_neese"	We had just started to potty train my 2 year old little girl when a trip to Disney World came. To be honest I didn't know what to do because she wouldn't go potty on the big potty.  I felt like we were going to have to take a whole week off from potty training her.  A full week at Disney World was not going to be fun carrying a potty seat around. Then I found this at babies r us!!! What a little blessing to little ones.  It fits perfect on any potty and she can go without being afraid of the potty. Plus it fit perfect in my Wendy Bellissimo diaper bag.  I carry it everywhere!! I don't leave home without it.  Thanks for such a wonderful product that helped make our first trip to Disney World so much better!!	1
523187	This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.

B00009UTLM:i_found_a_solution_to_commonly_reported_problems_with_this_product:jeffrey_johnston_"www.digitalphotoart.net"	I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated "flipping" of the flash that some other users have reported.  The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called "Gadget Infinity" under the listing title of "Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature".  Buy it now price is $29.99.  I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier.  Pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years	0

B000HT3K7O:i_am_just_not_that_impressed_or_entertained_by_their_latest_studio_effort:george_dionne	I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however	0

B000K0YFVU:why_is_it_that_the_bad_magazines_are_the_only_ones_you_get_for_free?:alli_kamikaze_"alli"	I've been receiving this magazine for almost 4 years now. It hasn't changed much since I started receiving it... and I pretty much still think of it as THE worst teen magazine that's still in business. I'm 16 now and haven't liked it anymore as I've gotten older. The strangest part about this magazine to me is the fact that they just keep sending it to me! I mean, I barely even remember when I was first subscribed to it (it was some kind of deal where you can get certain magazines for like 6 months or something, and I didn't have many choices so I picked this one). Eventually the other magazines stopped coming. But this one continued to come. And still does! I would have thought it might be nice if a company made an accidental error or something and continued to send me a magazine. I would have been thrilled if that happened with any other magazine (I actually don't mind Seventeen, Allure, CosmoGirl, TeenPeople occasionally, or even Teen Magazine.). But this one just makes me wonder if these people are downright stupid... the least they could have done is "accidentally" send it to someone who likes their magazine! If that person exists?	0

B0006G2LBY:very_pleasing:harry_pandolfino	I've been using Cross pens since I returned to my fountain pen roots several years ago but I decided to try this model because of its gorgeous design.  There are aspects of it that I like better.  The cartridges are longer, unlike the smaller Cross ones that run out much quicker and never seem to drain completely.  It was also ready to go as soon as the cartridge was inserted unlike the Cross which seem to be stubborn to get started.  It has a nice feel to it ergonomically and I nice feel to the nib on the paper.	1
B00080L006:small,_lightweight,_and_beautiful:john_seybold	I was looking for the lightest, slimmest possible wallet, and the Dopp Getaway is just about perfect.  For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying "Dopp" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.	1
343943	When I heard about this game at first, I was stunned.  DDR and Guitar Hero are both games that focus on "dance-like" and "guitar-like" motions, but they do not rely on the actual ability to dance or the actual ability to play guitar, merely on combinations of responses through specialized controllers.	1
B0001XG6Y0:a_good_alternative_to_renting_tents:t._chu	A great portable shelter for sun and rain. We bought it for a backyard event to give some shelter if it had rained. The weather turned out to be great and sunny, so the shelter was used to give our guest some shades from the bright sun. It was easy to set up and bring down. And the roller bag is also a good accessory to have to store and tranport the shelter easily	1
445505	Set in Venice at the end of World War II, Hemingway tells a romantic and touching story of the love affair between a gruff 50 year old American colonel and Renata, a young and very pretty Italian contessa.  Loss is a recurring theme--the death of many of the Colonel's subordinates in combat, the break-up of his earlier marriage to a career woman, and the severe injury to one of the Colonel's hands from which he suffers constant pain.  The Colonel may also be dying and his time left with his young lover may be very short.	1

250033	In terms of both format and style, "Rent" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.	0

84097	I am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  There was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.

This is a sit back and let it happen to you game - keep the people happy and build everything and they'll stay. Caesar IV - that's what you're wanting, it looks like everything this sets itself up to be that it isn't. Feel like I've wasted my money	0

431399	American Photo is a much better magazine than its sibling Popular Photography, but frankly, that is not saying much. It seems as though its primary market is fashion/glamour photographers since most of its issues are devoted to these aspects of professional photography. There are other magazines which excel at nature photography, so I am not disappointed by its absence here, but not noting more fine art documentary photograhy is a major omission which I hope this magazine does address eventually. There are also excellent photo equipment reviews frequently written by working professionals, as opposed solely to in-house technical equipment overviews. American Photo is without question among the better photo magazines currently available, but unless you are interested mainly in fashion and glamour photography, you might wish to look more closely at Shutterbug or other magazines devote to nature and fine art photography	1

109454	This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money	0

It has been over 1 month since I ordered this with the Crutchfield storefront at Amazon.com.  Amazon's site indicated the product was in stock, but since ordering, it has been placed on back order twice and expected to ship in a few days from now.  I just wonder how it could take so long to get a product from manufacturer to end user.  I don't know where this is manufactured, or who Crutchfield's supplier is, but needless to say I am not entirely pleased with this whole process... which doesn't really have anything to do with Amazon.

Well, the programs do open actually but I have time to vacuum and dust before they're launched. I used the repair fonction and uninstalled and reinstalled without any improvement.	0

B000ES7N9Y:if_six_stars_were_possible_..._i_would_rate_a_ten!:working_poor_"jd"	These are hands down, the most awesome pillows, we have ever owned.  They were originally suggested by a chiropractor at $60 per pillow, however at the time, a "water bed pillow" for $60 just sounded silly.  What brought me back around to these pillows, was the year-long search that my wife and I had been on for the perfect pillows.  One of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows, which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow.  We spent a year, buying this pillow and that pillow, all to no avail.  Then one day I rolled the dice, and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers.  The covers actually make the dish.  These are the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on in my 42 years on this planet!!!  These pillows rate 10 stars!!!  Just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had.  I do not work for, nor own this company, although after using their product I wish I did!!!  Our pillows are about three months old so far, and holding up exceptionally well.  They recommend you change the water every six months or so, depending on what type of water you put in.  The pillow is about half to three quarters cushion, with the water being the bottom layer.  They seal tight and do not leak. There is no audible sound from the water in the pillow, as if you follow the directions, they will instruct you on how to expel excess air.  These pillows and of those Black & Decker scissors, have to be my two best finds for 2006!!	1
159814	This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	0
B000DZFUIO:very_poor_quality_-_broke_after_3_months:alison_ayson_"aliayson"	I bought this camcorder 3 months ago and, after using it a grand total of 6 times, it is broken.  It constantly loses track of timestamp on the tape doing things like rewinding 2 minutes (two minutes on the counter in the display), refusing to rewind anymore and telling me the tape is full.  It's a 60 minute tape and it can only record 2 minutes???  I figured that was a problem with the tape so I tried another one, which seemed to work fine until I got home and tried to watch the footage.  The camera counter once again became confused and the whole camera just locked up.  I had to power off and on several times before finally getting the camera to rewind the tape to where I needed it to be.  Lastly, the mechanism for ejecting the tape broke after only one month.	0

They also make a great gift item	1
214448	'The Interface Between the Written and the Oral' is a comprehensive look at the development of writing in general and alphabets in particular, oral poetry in ancient Greece and Modern Africa, oral transmission of (written) Vedas, the impact of writing on recently oral cultures in West Africa, and the impact of writing on our own abilities of thought and organization. Perhaps the most disheartening, but nonetheless informative section, deals with the counterintuitive measures that social scientists have come up with to measure the impact of literacy. They seem to be lacking in common sense. Goody, however, is full of common sense, and this book is excellent reading	1

Therefore, a crock-pot dish that took 10hrs on low was done in 30min on low with this product, certainly this is not the product's fault but owner error. A very good product, highly recommended for campers and tailgaters	1
39493	EQMM is definitely a worthwhile magazine for any true fan of mysteries.  Is every story exceptional, of course not and that's unrealistic to expect it to be.  The stories are however entertaining and you get the opportunity to see something from some of your favorite writers.  I think it's enjoyable to read a short story from writers you like whether it is a surefire classic or just another tale.  To address, some of the issues by the jaded first reviewer, look at it from the standpoint of a mystery lover.  If the publishers only produced great classic books, we would have only a handful of books each year, instead of the masses that readers have the fun of combing thru each year. The pages smudge, but this is not a magazine that is mass produced like People or Time or Sports Illustrated.  At the current price, you could probably only get one to two stories a month for glossy pages.  If you're reluctant to get a subscription then at least go to your local bookstore and buy the latest copy of EQMM and find out for yourself how enjoyable getting a quick glimpse into dozen of mystery writers can be	1

It's a pretty good method. Sometimes a bit difficult to work with, but you do learn some things. I stopped using it because it became increasingly difficult to play when I realized that I had a bass amp. So make sure you have all the right equipment, and I would have to say that this might be easier for someone who's taken guitar lessons.	1

65632	Having recieved both DogFancy and DogWorld, I prefer DogWorld. I have found that DogFancy tends to focus more on purebreds and AKC events than on the general, everyday mutts of America and what the owner of one can do with them. As an owner of a shelter mutt, I appreciate DogWorld's emphasis on the world of dogs- their nutrition, health/care, exercise, and varied news paragraphs. I especially like the column on agility training- it is as beneficial to agility persons as well as great advice for any other sport- flyball, obedience, herding/hunting trials, etc. since all sports deal with pretty much the same mental and physical aspects. I also really enjoy the different sports they highlight in each issue. The only thing about DogWorld that bothers me is its series articles. If you don't follow one series to completion you get confused and sometimes the series are more geared to the professional world (veternarians and trainers) than to the 'regular' folk. DogWorld gives a much more rounded view of the world of dogs and what can be done with them than DogFancy which tends to focus on more of the breeding side of the world and AKC	1

I did try Namo Web Editor and for people like me, it is very good.  This may be wonderful for those of you who are very web page saavy but again if you are a novice don't get this or uprgrade to it, you will be HIGHLY disappointed	0

B00005V1XM:why_did_they_have_to_ruin_the_cast_&_crew_interviews?:paul_rudoff_"http://1shop.bravehost.com"	I'm not going to comment on the episodes because almost all of them can be found on the Season 1 & 2 box sets, which is how you're better off seeing them (at least they're in order and paired together with the proper companion episodes).  Instead I will be focusing on the bonus features.  Not the Violent Femmes music video, because that too can be found on the Season 1 box set, but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features.  I love the interviews and the "in studio" voice recording re-enactments, but I *HATE* how EVERY piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame.  You can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen, and even then it isn't clear as there's a bubble "shine" over it.  I'd love for Paramount/Nick to include all of the original, non-bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set, even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2	0
B00004T1HK:yeh,_you_did_it_again:the_main_man_"the_mighty_big_bear"	Made another bull**** album. Honestly I didn't hear this whole album. About 5 years ago I was ridin wit one of my boys and he played this cd. Oh my god for the first time in my life I wished I was deaf. I see the reason why her albums sell though. Cause its her looks and nothin else. She's not ugly at all to me. She just can't sing. But she can livin up a crowd.

536603	Sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss (Jinpachi) is really cheap and lame! Even at the "easy" difficulty, just a couple of hits from this freak and you're dead! The Devil Within mini-game is also stupid, some levels are just impossible and too hard. I wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here, not to mention some save points are hidden. Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles, spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level, then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can't save your game, then you're gonna have to redo the entire level again!!! That is one sick stupid game design! The only reason I'm playing this mini-game is just to get the hidden items	0

B0000296RB:oh_the_humanity!:jeffrey_leach	There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. "Universal Soldier: The Return" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to "Manos: The Hands of Fate" for comparison. The first "Universal Soldier" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and "Rocky" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll.	0

B000FEF9LQ:looks_great_but_lousy_in_practice:poker_chef_"poker_chef"	Corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies.  Usually (but not always) Oxo products are good at making things easier to do.  I have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one.  Getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky.  You also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork.  Poor design this time OXO.	0
79034	There are some amazing moments on this record.  I find myself freaking out to three songs in a row, and waiting for the fourth song to end.

It takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my 2 car garage and still lets 1 car in. Great multi-function product. You can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition. Pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow (no problems yet) for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping (another 155 value) It was REALLY worth it.

B000AXQSVC:a_marginal_camera_at_best...:robert_wheeler	VERY slow storage even with a fast card....small but too thick for comfortable handling. I ended up selling it on ebay and buying a Canon SD600 which is a great camera, thin enough to fit in your shirt pocket, fast storage of images and the battery lasts a very long time. I've charged it once and have taken many many holiday pictures. Don't buy the Nikon without first checking out the Canon SD600.	0
262150	I'll get to the point ... if you are looking to stay abreast of what's going on in popular music, including the Indie scene, the Americana world and the major elders still around, this is as far as you need to go. The quality of the writing, be it an in-depth article (many of which are excellent) or a short review (you can expect about 200 per issue) is consistently high. Furthermore, I have been introduced to many great bands that don't even show up in any domestic magazine's radar, although -ironically- many of these bands are American. So, if you can't believe that best it gets is Spin or, much worse, Rolling Stone (how did it ever got to the low point of having Jessica Simpson on the cover ... yikes!), you will be immensely rewarded by trying Uncut. Tip: you can get any single issue at B&amp;N, Borders or Tower Records for the same amount, that way if you don't like it you won't have to mourn 100 bucks	1

B0002Y9T6U:an_astonishing_classic:spencer_pennington	"Burnin'" was the last album by the Wailers as a collective group, afterwhich Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the group to pursue solo careers and Marley reformed his group, calling it "Bob Marley & the Wailers" in 1974.  The album shows the original three at their best, balancing lead vocals on several songs between Bob Marley, Bunny Wailer, and Peter Tosh.  The album not only serves to further reveal Bob's soon-to-be legendary work, but also to show the talent of Bunny Wailer with his lead vocals on songs like "Hallelujah Time" and "Pass It On".	1
B0000046SJ:not_great:dale_perkins	While I love Billie, in her own words, these sessions were dull, and uninspired.

28818	I use this little gadget mainly for macro and portrait work.  When you have it on the light emitting from the flash is diffused which gives you a more flattering less contrasty light to illuminate your subjects with.  Unless you are going for a very shadowy, high-contrast, image this diffuser can save the day.  It is very light weight and easy to pack in small places, so you should never have a good reason to leave it behind.  Sometimes it is the simple things that make the biggest difference in a photo, and using this can defiantly make very noticeable differences	1

546573	The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars.	0

B000BURAP2:the_science_of_ripping_off_parents:dmitri_ulinov_"du"	Here's a quick primer for parents looking to buy science kits for the early grade school set (i.e., K - 3rd).  Every science kit, including this one, basically tells you to mix vinegar with baking soda and "Voila!" you made a volcano.  Nevermind that in later years some kid will go hiking in the crater of Mt. St. Helen's during an eruption thinking it is just harmless cooking products.  Use safe chemicals to make scientific changing colors? You guessed it -- food dye.  All these kits basically include a set of plastic test tubes and instructions telling you to open your kitchen cupboards.  Back in the Middle Ages people who sold this kind of hokum for the price it now commands were called alchemists.  They eventually went out of business.  Buy the kid a Suzukie violin or a football helmet instead	0

Top of the line AA NiMH batteries have capacity of 2500 mAh. Top of the line NiCad D-Cell batteries have 5000 mAh capacity (costs around five bucks). I thought that NiMH was more capable than NiCad. True, but not in this case.	0
226776	On an episode of Seinfield that is probably overexposed enough as it is, the always wily and oh so goofy character of Kramer is playing a game of Risk and exclaims that the "Ukraine is weeeeak".  This causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble.  I think the same basic sentiments work with this New Order release.  It probably wasn't worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent "Rock The Shack" and of course "Crystal", which I'll get back to later.  Unlike Kramer I feel I can make this statement safely as I'm not dealing with a burly, alcohol swigging Ukranian, but New Order fans, which aren't the most intimidating bunch out there.  Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important, which it is, maybe.  This album features the guitar of Billy Corgan, the frontman of the seminal 90's group Soundgarden.  Too bad they couldn't get Billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy, and wasn't writing very good material or really using his guitar, at all.  New Order also made the mistake of having Corgan to backing vocals.  Now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough, but to top that off with a Billy Corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice.  So...Someone Like You is more or less unlistenable.  It has some pretty terrible lyrics about how Bernard doesn't want to wash his car.  Now I can relate, I wouldn't want to wash my car in Britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair, but this topic doesn't result in the most captivating and well-written material.  New Order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album, something they don't do very often, just like Van Morrison.  Now I'm not sure if I've heard a Van Morrison song but I've always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars.  Case in point of this `not so good of an idea rawking' is Rock The Shack.  Rock The Shack kind of sounds like New Order's take on someone commissioned to write an epic Gilligan's Island rock song, pretty amazing huh?  '60 Miles an Hour', `Primitive Notion', and `Close Range' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland.  New Order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80's artist like Depeche Mode, The Cure, and Tears For Fears (who've actually always blown).  However, they do succeed fully well on two songs here.  There is `Crystal', which is truly an excellent rock song and show New Order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of New Order's career from the 90's and beyond.  How this didn't get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me, because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it.  The other is Run Wild which is really a great little slow song, in the vein of `As It Is When It Was.  Probably New Order's only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic, moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album.  Get Ready is good beginning and end, just not end between.  Kind of like that movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me	0

The only thing that could make it better is if it let the tv rest closer to the wall, but from what I have seen they all sit out from the wall about two inches. I have a 32" LCD mounted on it and it seems pretty heavy for the mount so I always try to keep it closer to the wall, but every time I come home my wife has it extended all the way and swung over 45 degrees. This hasn't caused any problems and I'm sure this is well within its design strength.	1

155083	If a book makes me look forward to mid-life - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  Here, Harvard researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the media gives us.

0345476735:a_book_only_worth_reading...:mickey_bitsko	...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! I must admit that I did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  And what's this odd sub-plot of a former-Mormon/Hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the United States.  Once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  Puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the Mormons (he should have stuck with the Catholic Church). I would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! I would go crazy reading it again	0

B00006IDPG:works_well:food_fan	I like this paper better than the HP paper...the HP paper seems to stick together more in clumps of pages.  The Office Depot paper looks good when I print on it.

If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber, I haven't found it.  Just be aware that, if you prefer sugary sweet cereals, this definitely is not the one for you	1

B000A3I2ZC:seemed_nice_at_first:t._brannock	This isn't a bad dryer when it comes to convenience and travelling. However, the folding handle did eventually break and I had to modify it to hold it together. I haven't noticed any benefit from the ion control, mine and my wife's hair get's easily frizzled with this dryer, plus it takes a long time to dry in comparison to what others have claimed. The switch is definitely very difficult to use, there's no way a person can use it with one hand.  If you tried, you'd end up dropping the thing. The fact that the off position is between the two speed settings isn't very good either because you push so hard to move the switch you simply move from high to low instead of to the off position. Personally, I can't wait to find her a better one so I can tear this one apart for more interesting things. On the upside, after fixing the handle, it has worked without any real problems for 6 months	0
0679755721:american_voltaire:"pjmorv"	Did we need a Gore Vidal reader? The author is something of a long-winded blowhard, commenting at length (and I mean LENGTH) on every topic imaginable. In that respect he is America's Voltaire, creating reams of comment and interpretation on politics, the arts, and religion and morals. It's hard to say where Vidal fits in the framework of 20th century criticism, as he is not a conventional leftist. Because of his iconoclasm, this collection can only inform the reader about Gore Vidal, not his times nor any intellectual or political movement. All that said, Vidal is a great essayist and a droll wit. This book is much too much for the casual reader -- stick to one of his many shorter collections instead -- but for a Vidal fan (or, say, a reader of &quot;The Nation&quot;) this book is worth the time commitment	1
B0002F5C7Y:nice:payeyo	I own a couple of tambourines, but have played a few. This one is light, bright and kinda cool looking. The inward placement of the handle allows it to be played windshield wiper style, with the wrist, or a combination of both allowing for great speed and variety. You can also get two different soundings hits whether you use the inner or the outer ring. Hit the inner ring for a more open sound and the outer for a more dry and close one. All in all a nice tambourine specially for the price	1

B00005BJY9:why_does_jet_li_star_in_wong_jing_films?:"amclawhorn"	This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this	0
394937	The late Carl Sagan was one of the most popular, influential, and successful interpreters of astronomy to the American public. In 1973 he published &quot;The Cosmic Connection&quot;. He offered a daring view of the universe and his seminal work became a classic of popular science, inspiring a generation of scientists and non-specialist general readers with an enthusiasm for all aspects of science in general, and astronomy in particular. Now Cambridge University Press has reissued a new edition of Sagan's influential book, enhanced with Freeman Dyson's commentary on Sagan's vision and on the importance of &quot;The Cosmic Connection&quot;; Ann Dryan's assessment of Sagan's cultural significance as a champion of science; and David Morrison's discussion of the advances made over the past 30 years and what became of Sagan's predictions. Carl Sagan's Cosmic Connection is &quot;must&quot; reading for all Sagan fans and anyone interested in how his views and predictions have held up over the past three decades of rapid advances in the science of astronomy and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence	1

Wow! Revolutionary film-making...not!"   Yes, Ben was weak, immature, and had bad taste in women. His learning to overcome his weakness, immaturity, bad taste in women, and then defy his family and Elaine's family was his coming of age story.  That WAS the point of the movie.  It went right over your head!  The acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out!  How could you not love this movie?  Maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value.  Watch it again in a few years.  I think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time.	1
B000000DZC:we_don't_need_no_water..._let_it_burn!:julian_hayter	Unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide, and fortified roots reggae album! If you don't have Firehouse Rock in your CD collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan, you may need to re-evaluate what you think you know about Jamaican music. The Roots Radics, especially the rythym section, utilize (with supreme efficacy, I might add) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae "riddims." On top of the Radics, the Wailing Souls add ethereal vocals, while staying masterfully conscious. Firehouse Rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible Jamaican history and an absolute must have	1
528462	Going by the Plantronics name I bought a pair of M60 headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone.

B0002DB59A:very_sweet:thenorthworld	I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection	1

In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.

B0002IHETU:a_kids_guitar_you_can_be_happy_with:j._scharp	We bought this guitar for our smaller seven year old son. It was hard to choose a guitar, because there are so many out there...toy version and real...but which to choose?  This one is worth the pos. feedback I am giving it. It seemed so small and cute when I opened it, but it is perfect for little hands and bodies!  I found the price very reasonable since we aren't sure if he will "keep the interest",(some toy ones cost close to this) but yet I wanted him to feel like he was getting a REAL guitar, in hopes that he will keep learning.  I found that the guitar is very nice, not a toy at all, tunes well, looks very attractive and sounds nice too.  I was impressed that it came with a warranty.  I am happy that I didn't spend close to this for the toy versions...and I got the real deal instead.  Shipping was INCREDIBLY fast from this company	1

B000AYJDCW:unfortunately_must_return_it.:jay_church_"jay"	Received the DXG-506V yesterday and was surprised to find out that it had no tripod mount. Many sites showed a light and tripod as optional accessories for this unit but there is no way to mount these accessories to the cam. This is kind of like false advertising. This is a no deal for me because the cam is so dark in normal indoor lighting situations as compared to other cams at similar prices (like the optimus that radio shack sells) and there is also no image stabilization. Geez, how hard would it have been to put a simple  inch plastic mount on the bottom. As for sound, the built in microphone produces too much hiss and is located in a place that does not allow it to pick up the voices and sounds of what you are shooting. You can hear yourself talking great but not the person you are shooting. That is pretty bad. The resulting audio with the hiss sounds like a cheap 1970's cassette tape recorder.	0

B000HVDCZM:dead_after_one_use:ved_chirayath_"vedchirayath"	The product was shipped to me in Moscow. After the first charge, I took it to university where it powered my notebook for two hours. Upon returning home and recharging the device, I discover that it will not turn on anymore. I suspect the battery is charging as the LED indicates this as it is connected to AC power. However, disconnecting it from any power source, it appears that the AC outlet and USB ports no longer function. The device gives no auditory signal or LED message, so I don't know if the built in inverter is out or something else is wrong with it. Either way, I'm left with a dead device that never supported charging from a 45 Watt solar panel anyway. I strongly suggest getting the battery from Tekkeon. Sorry about the bad review, but I had my hopes for this device as well.	0

B000CD6B3A:camera_can't_focus_and_kodak_service_stinks:guru	I bought my Kodak V570 less than a year ago. At first the only annoyance I had was the fact that I had to use an attachment to transfer the pictures and that the video was in MOV format that made it diffcult to edit. But a few months ago, the focus refused to work properly. In wide angle, it was fine but when I zoomed in, the image was unacceptably blur. I tried every setting, finally gave up and called Kodak service. I was asked to mail the camera to Sydney from Melbourne where I live. A few weeks later, the camera returns with a note that there was noting wrong with it. Since I still could not take acceptable pictures, I contacted them again. This time to be told to send pictures via e-mail. I did and to my surprise the answer was that poor lighting caused the shutter speed to slow down and hence the blur images. But the pictures were taken in broad daylight. When I disagreed with the logic of the comment, I was told to call them for a discussion over the phone. But the number they gave me was a fax number. Using my resources, I got in touch with technical service by phone. This time I was told to try using a tripod and if the pictures come out alright, it's probably due to shaky hands! It's as though they have people in tech support who have never owned a camera and who have never taken pictures before in their lives. It is so frustrating thinking of the damage the camera has done to my recent India trip when many of the pictures turned out blur. Now I have to put up with illogical and incompetent service people. There is no way I will ever buy another Kodak again. I can recommend it only to my worst enemies. I have now to, again, send the camera in for troubleshooting and going by the level of service so far, I am not holding my breath for answers. Still want to buy a Kodak? Go ahead but don't say I did not warn you. By the way, my other camera is a Casio and it works beautifully shaky hands or not	0
B000GWX888:sprint_picture_mail_is_the_worst!:k_and_c_"k_and_c"	I was with Sprint for almost 10 years, all told. I had a picture mail account with them for about 3 years. Just recently, without any warning, whatsoever, they deleted over 500 of my precious pictures from my picture mail account...pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time.  Most of these pics were VERY important to me and are now lost forever.(I had only backed up about 45 of them.) I guess it was my own fault for trusting Sprint, but they offered no real explanation and when I tried to have the pics recovered, not only could they not do that, but they said they had NO RECORD of me ever having the picture account that I had with them for almost three years!!! This is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me! So, my advice: DON'T TRUST SPRINT!!! Again, this happened with any warning! It could happen to you too!

240877	After reading a few of the other reviews, I am again baffled by the left/liberal take on things.  This is a CONSERVATIVE magazine!!  Liberals, open at your own risk!  You just MIGHT encounter a differing view point than you own!  Goodness.  The articles are informative, indepth, humorous, and thoughtful.  It's a good read.	1
403754	I was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. It isn't really, and there isn't really that much to this magazine.  It is just another tired old AOLTimeWarner publication, just like Time, People, or Teen People.  I looked at the August and September issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on Elton John's Out of Africa fundraiser and the article on Julian McMahon.  The rest of it was ads, and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in Vogue magazine, but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else, and they are annoying.  There were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of Kelly Ripa (post excessive Photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it "plastic person syndrome") Mark Consuelos, waay too much on Jennifer Garner and her baby, and other weird things, such as the trend of designer cupcakes.  I wish I was kidding on the latter, but I am not, nor do I have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is Jessica Alba's favorite.  There was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here.  Despite the size of this magazine, there is very little to sink ones teeth into, just way too many photos of the same old same old, and tips for mimicking them.  I am NOT interested in becoming a Teri Hatcher clone, nor am I interested in seeing Vanessa Carlton's pad.  This magazine is for you if you like excessive ads, no diversity, a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in New York because some celebrity did.  This magazine is mediocre at best, and the worst part is, it has the exact same fashion advice as Vogue.  I went with Vogue because there is substance in their magazine, and the ads are classy and very chic.  Leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at AOL Time Warner.	0
B0009K5U2Y:underwear:kari_j._schulte	The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.	0
158253	I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use.

222837	I've had this game since the day it came out and some of the cutscenes my opinion are better than a lot of games out today. This games unique gameplay i think adds to its satisfactory. I love everything about this game for example:	1
B000225ZM4:works_great_but_smells_a_little_odd:gensparkie	I've been a fan of this product for a couple of years, since I have very long, wavy hair. It moisturizes really well and I use it every ten days or so. It smells like a weird salad dressing when you put it on, kind of vinegary and spicy, but when you wash it out the scent is toned down a bit. It still smells unusual (spicy and vaguely nutty), but not unpleasant.	1
B0006SJZMU:dependable_phone_for_basic_use:l._rojales	I've had this phone for a year and a half with no problems.  It is good for making calls which is really all I ask for from a phone.  It is easy enough to use that I even bought one for my elderly parents and they've had no problems.  My carrier is Cingular and I've had excellent service in the NY tri-state area and because it is a quad-band phone, I've also been able to use it while roaming internationally.  Battery life is just okay (not as good as my old Nokia)...I have to recharge every other day with normal use.  Overall, it's lasted me long enough that I would call it a good value.	1
B000LAC9W6:very_realistic_looking_barbie_doll....:jamie_nicety	I just bought this doll @ Toys R Us and I was also able to purchase The Hilary Duff Shopping Sisters doll which is supposed to include her sister Haylie Duff which isn't available yet. I have the two other Hilary dolls the first of which was released in 2002 or 2003 and it was a Lizzie McGuire doll which doesn't look much like Hilary at all. Then there was the Hilary dolls released by Playmates which had a more slight resemblance than the first doll. Now Mattel has made a doll of Hilary Duff and it is by far the most visibly accurate doll I've seen. And the clothes and accessories are really cute too. I think a lot of girls would love this doll and possibly older fans too. I'm just waiting for the Haylie Duff doll to debut early next year and her doll also bears a striking resemblance. The dolls are available @ Toys R Us, KB Toys, Wal-Mart all under $20.00.	1
B000BM67XG:better_than_the_alternative:e._muirhead_"lizanneh"	I started off using Turbotax this year, but returned it to the store to use Taxcut instead. I purchased this version because it was a bargain, and it's easy enough to do state taxes by hand (or for free on the state website for those states that have that option).	1
0141001453:definitive,_but_not_definitive...:"stbob"	This is a great book to have in your collection if you're a fan of blues music and history.  By far, it's not the ONLY book out there.  There are a  number of notable artists this book is missing.  Hopefully, future editions  of this book will begin to fill some of the gaps.  That being said, this is  a very good reference just the same	1

542549	There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely	0
269636	Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas?	0

B000NA780M:resource_hog_that_causes_applications_to_lock:djw	Having had Norton products installed for years including AntiVirus, Internet Security, and SystemWorks, I decided to replace the installed products with Norton 360 and a non-Norton password manager.  Obviously, it is critical to FIRST remove all Norton programs before installing Norton 360.  The installation process proceeded relatively smoothly.	0
B0001CU1C4:vhs_version_a_little_better...:b._baier_"story_chaser"	I played "Atmosfear, The Harbingers" on VHS in the mid-90s and several years later bought a copy of the game through ebay.  Then, I saw this DVD update and gave in to temptation when the price was marked down.  Here's my judgement: 1) The mechanics have been simplified.  This has it's pros and cons.  It could have been made easier to learn without removing as many components.  2) The gatekeeper has less of a nasty/funny balance in the DVD update.  3) It is a major upswing to have his dialogue randomly disbursed.	1

So pay close attn before you buy this product.	1
B000FNB3BC:disappointing_compared_to_nana's_brownie_mint,_&_peanut_butter_cookies:groovy_vegan	Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)	0
403688	While many mainstream publications have been shying away from calling members of the current American government into account for their transgressions - from bribery and theft to misinformation and cover-ups of sexual escapades - "The Nation" has done its job and reported the facts.  For its trouble, many of those who lean the same way as the current administration lambast the magazine as "too liberal" and "naively progressive."	1
b000biu1x2:affordable_elegance:d._summers	I am thrilled with this purchase. I had initially ordered 4 chairs and the companion dining table. Upon its delivery, I went back and ordered another pair of chairs. They are very comfortable, generously proportioned, their overall styling very beautiful to the eye. I have subsequently received many compliments on this set. I just wish they sold a larger matching table.	1
380049	I bought this after it had been out a year, so not as much available on line as there was a year ago, also it is a German game, so limited USA playing.  But I loved the first Sacred & I also loved Sacred underworld, if you don't plan on on line playing Sacred is worth the money	1

He was astoundingly funny. This DVD definitely captures his comic genius, although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed.	1
B00007G314:doesnt_fit_on_our_crib:hawaiian_built	The bumper was very cute and colorful and I was excited to put it on the baby's crib...until I put it on...no matter how I tried to fit it onto the crib (it is a white spindle Jenny Lind crib full-size) it fit very akwardly and never quite right. There were large spaces where it should have fit snugly around the inside of the crib. I was very disappointed since it is very colorful and matches the sheet and comforter we received as gifts	0

B000068FH4:i_was_lucky_to_get_the_stainless_popper_on_clearance:diane	I was lucky to get the Stainless Popper on Clearance.  It is wonderful. We have used it for several months now.  It is so fast and the pop corn is like movie theatre pop corn.  I am so disappointed that Target is not carrying the stainless model anymore.  My college children who don't live at home want their own, even my daughter who had not been a popcorn fan.  I'm sorry to hear about problems with the all aluminum models.  When I bought mine, I chose stainless because I knew it could handle the high heat well - and of course the bottom can go in the dishwasher.  Hey, Target, how about carrying the stainless model again?	1
B0002VG2XG:awesome_shoes:d._lusk	I bought these shoes for my husband. I ordered them on a Monday and they were at my house by Wednesday! I have owned a pair of "real" Birks before and these look identical to them. My husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones	1

B000BDG84S:good_performer:af	I have used the unit for about two weeks, with NiMH rechargable batteries installed, and it performs as advertised. There is, in my opinion, a design flaw: the Start/Stop button acts as the power on{off function, and is easily depressed at unwanted times, e.g. putting into or removing from the case.  They could/should have included an AC adapter	1

B000EF3E68:delicious_and_convenient:janeinmia	I've always loved smoked oysters but most brands come packed in cottonseed oil, which is vile to say the least.  The Crown Prince oysters are packed in olive oil -- a huge step up in health and taste.  They are convenient little bundles of protein that can be packed in a lunch, etc.  They taste wonderful added to soup or stew.  Great for last minute entertaining.  Last but not least, I like to have a case on hand in my disaster supplies	1

B000ELQUZO:my__view:a._may_zing	Our family loves all types of memory games, and this is the most attractive.  The colorful stripes on the back are great, the pictures are good, the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying, and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box.  My only negative comment is that there is no indication  which country each child represents.  The children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together...I think it is an obvious teaching opportunity. In fact, I would like to know this myself	0

B000067AT9:the_private_press:chris_nielsen	Dj Shadow is in my honest opinion one of the most overlooked artists in music today. Threading the thin line between commercial and underground, and finding his niche somewhere in between (as UNKLE says, the middle ground between light and shadow) DJ Shadow continues to impress with every release he puts forth. I was fortunate enough to pick this album up right after its release, and actually purchased it before I bought Endtroducing, which is by far DJ Shadow's best album, and one of the best albums ever made. By sampling elements from just about anywhere Shadow combines elements from our pop culture to create mini-movies of his songs which few artists can touch in terms of sheer production value, and the emotional effect that is created while listening to his music. I am actually glad I bought this album before Endtroducing as it has given me the time to truly appreciate this album for what it is; a work of art, and a continual growing of Shadow's talents. Had I bought Endtroducing before this and writtwn a review I'm sure I would have garnered it with a 4 star review, but that is simply not the case here. While Endtroducing is always going to be leaques above and beyond this album, Josh Davis has found a way here to go above and beyond what should be expected of an album, and given us an album that I'm sure years from now I will still find elements in it that will grow even more on me with time. Best enjoyed while driving or relaxing at home (possibly with a little mary in tow, if you know what I mean), the songs fluctuate with peaks and valleys of highs and lows, and the beats are flawless, especially when compared to a lot of the mainstream garbage that is put out in the record industry on a regular basis. See the thing is that Shadow bases his music upon how he feels, and artists that do this correctly achieve an emotional reaction from their music that the true artists of our world truly achieve. Radiohead for example has a way of doing this, and it is not surprising then that one of DJ Shadows favorite artists is Radiohead, they both fuse these elements into their music, and achieve monumental status in my opinion. The package design is equally well done as well showing an artists eye for presentation, and a graffiti influenced design to the overall package. If you enjoy this album then I highly recommend any of Shadows works: Endtroducing, Preemptive Strike, The Private Press, and In Tune and On Time, which is a live set recorded in support of this album. UNKLE is also a well thought out album which bridges the gap between hip-hop, rock and techno, with guest appearences by Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Thom Yorke from Radiohead, and others from throughout the music industry. If you've never heard of DJ Shadow before, then I must say that you are missing out, if you are at all interested in underground music, do yourself a favor and pick up any of Shadow's albums or collaborations, I guarantee you will extremely impressed, as with any good album the songs have a way of growing on you over time. Peace out	1
B0009IK198:works_good:juan_c._cantu_"jcantu"	I have been using this shaver for 2 weeks now and have not had any problems with it. It is easy to use and clean I have only had to charge it once so far. Even though this is my first electric shaver, it is a good deal for the money. It doesn't shave as close as a razor but it's close. I would recommend it or give it as a gift.	1

B000IZ5I2M:just_gorgeous:rangatango	As a fragrance addict I will try anything once- but I am hooked on this stuff.  I don't often purchase solid perfumes as all of the ones I have tried tend to be greasy feeling on, and don't last very long.  This is completely different- it's easy to apply but isn't at all greasy and last quite a while.  This scent is beautiful and floral/spicy and not overpowering.  If you enjoy Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker, I think you'll enjoy this too- plus you can take it anywhere- it's only as big as a tube of lipstick.  Finally, beauty habit sent me a little handwritten note of thanks and a little bag of perfume and lotion samplers with my order.  I can't wait to try the other scents by Crazylibellule and The Poppies and I would definitely shop again with Beauty Habit.	1
B00004RUWV:the_eggplant_that_ate_chicago:linda_pagliuco_"magari"	Haven't read the book, so can't compare, but  The Relic on film is simply pathetic. Yes, it's a monster movie. The problem is, this movie is no better than most of its genre, and worse than some. The monster looks like a refugee from one of the Star Wars episodes. The acting and dialogue are terrible. What a yawner!	0

B000CP4IJ2:this_battery_sucks!!!:alex_walker	Don't order this battery unless you have money to throw away!  I ordered one that would not hold a charge, called the company and they told me it was defective and to send it back.  Did that and got a replacement that proved to be just as bad.  Now after 3 months, it isn't even holding a charge for more that 15 minutes of usage time!!!  This is unacceptable, and again the company is still trying to stand behind their bogus product!  AVOID AT ALL COST, EVEN IF THAT MEANS PAYING THE EXTRA $10 BUCKS FOR AN ORIGINAL KODAK BRANDED BATTERY	0
107132	This has to be the best of the Alien films! This film, although not as scary as the original (I mean that it did not scare me as much as Alien), it is much more exciting and enjoyable than the first.

B00009KF1J:yuck!:k._barlow_"kelly_b"	When I think "dark roast" I think full bodied and DARK.  Melitta pods are the worst I've tried.  I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre.  I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta.  I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine	0

When I opened up the box of this tea I thought I was standing over an old ash tray!  It's smells horrid and doesn't infuse well into the water.  I steeped a table spoon of it for five minutes and the water color barely changed.  I highly recommend you NOT buy this tea.  Exotic product aside, the plain old Lipton green tea bags from the grocery store are far better	0

B0000C508P:even_kink_can_be_boring:william_a._smith_"polymath"	If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea. Howewver, if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject, then you are out of luck.	0
B000067DKA:good_for_children's_bedroom:evelina	I have purchased Lentek Bite Shield because it is the only product  I was able to find, that works on the same principle as european mosquito repellents I am used to. I needed it for my daughter's bedroom so I couldn't use any type of candles for the safety reasons and I didn't want to use anything that rubbs directly on the skin since she has extremely sensitive skin. Lentek Bite Shild seems to work pretty well, she got bitten only once - the night I forgot to turn it on. Now I plan to buy the adapter to plug it in the outlet. That way I would be sure that the batteries wouldn't die in the middle of the night.	1

B000005GYW:lou_donaldson_still_like_usual_funks_away:	Another typical funk classic album from the brilliant tenor sax sounds of Lou Donaldson. The album released on Blues Notes features Lou's popular and individual classic jazz funk tones. Lou even opts to 'chill' out on a  number called 'Over The Rainbow' but on other numbers like 'Donkey Walk'  Lou's style and also his unique band really shine. The unmistakable hammond  adds yet more funk and along with the jazzy guitar sound and funk and  swinging drums this brings together another great album.Keep on funkin Mr  Lou Donaldson!!!!	1

6303077781:a_man_escaped--so_did_the_print:sandy	This is one of cinema's great achievements, a testament of the combination of elements (subject, visual style, photographic image, movement, sound, background music, character, montage) are perfectly blended into a unique experience.  The New Yorker print, however, is the worst copy of this film (16mm, 35mm, television screenings) I have ever seen.  This was a copy with a lack of contrast, extra noise on the track, looking like a dub.  If only there was a decent attempt to attain anything better would have begun to do the film justice.  As it is, enjoy what you're stuck with but know there's something better out there.	1

B000BH2AZU:good_accessory_for_your_tent_cot:timothy_steinhoff_"merc"	I recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it. The rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners. Also, there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips. The sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don't have it fully zipped up. My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get five stars is that I think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately	1

Co-starring dancers Vera-Ellen and Ann Miller, "On the Town" was one of the first color films shot on location in Manhattan, and remains one of the grandest, liveliest Hollywood musicals ever made.	1

B0000CEOOH:ultimate_use:b._chandler_"xyzzy"	Let's face it, you make an effort to have your home clean and coordinated.  Nice furniture and practical book shelves.  But you do not live alone; there is probably a canine or feline lurking around.  It may seem novel to buy a bowl with a picture of Garfield on it or some cutesy saying.  But in the long run this durable, multi use, dishwasher safe, bowl will look much better and your companion will not have to look embarrassed every time he/she wants a few laps of water.	1

B000B688OI:don't_buy_this_product!!!:k._kampe	This is the most innacurate thermometer I have ever come across.  Each reading seems to increase or drop by 1 degree or more.  Moreover, the battery only lasts for 1-2 uses.  Granted, one needs to take 10 readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature, but you would think the battery could last a few more times.  When you have a sick child, accuracy and time are of the essence	0
B000001J2W:disappointing_compared_to_other_cds/albums:"bob20092"	This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead	0
435765	1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B&W so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!!	1

0143058398:enjoyable_fiction_tying_past_&_present:dm_"dm"	Based on the description, I expected this to be a DaVinci Code knock-off, but gave it a shot since I recieved a free copy.  Comparing Labyrinth to The Davinci Code do it injustice; this is definately not an imitator and is worth reading in it's own right.  I enjoyed the characters, plot, and switching between the past and present.  I'm not sure it has literary value (I wouldn't argue that The DaVinci Code does, either), but it's certainly complex enough to make you think about the plot and character relationships without being difficult to follow	1
6304267835:a_contrary_opinion:sheetal_bahl	Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.	0

B00021B9O8:love_the_stuff:n._cure_"hufflepuff"	I absolutely love this eyeshadow. I have it in three different colors, as after my first one (the Illuminateur), I got addicted. I've since bought the Ambre and the Bleu Swimming Pool. It can be hard to tell from pictures on this site, or any other, what the color of this item is really like. That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered. All of the colors have a lot of "oomph" to them. Make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging).	1

122709	This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history	0
B000031XD7:little_ladybug_sandbox:l._harvey	I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up.  We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three.  We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play.  He played for hours!!  Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it.  It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard.  It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it	1
073870508X:rambling_and_ambiguous:s._w._best_"avid_reader"	I have studied the tarot for nearly 5 years and keep an open mind whenever a new book appears on the market.  Edain McCoy, who has written some wonderful New Age material, strikes an off-putting note in this one.  The spreads are certainly imaginative and are perhaps insightful to her own method of tarot interpretation, but convey confusing and ambiguous directions to the reader who is trying to understand her card placements.  In several of her spreads she conveys that a card's placement at a certain point in the spread "may or may not" mean some karmic element at play.  The whole exercise of creating a spread is to pinpoint with a degree of accuracy the situation you wish to define.  Therefore, when a card "may or may not" mean something, that interpretation could significantly change on whether you "may or may not" interpret it that way, leaving the interpreter open to rationalizing a card's meaning.  Tarot cards are intuitive, not rational, and their meanings can best be intuited when their placement is clearly defined without ambiguity   It is difficult to have it both ways and I found working with these spreads difficult.  Imagine doing a Celtic Cross reading and the first position "may or may not" be the root of the issue.  These spreads speak very clearly to the author, but not so to the reader.  I rate it 2 stars for depth and insight into Karma and past lives, but the explanations are too ambiguous.	0

B0007OWSXQ:ninety_dollars_for_this_is_unreasonable:jkjkjkjk	Ninety dollars for this is unbelievable.  For less than $15 (that is less than one sixth the advertised price) someone with NO skill could make an equivalent product from pine 4x4s and 1x12s in 30 minutes or less.  It may not be "cool", but it'll get the job done.  Are you more interested in getting fit or having cool, trendy, and frivolous toys?	0
B00004S4U8:a_lesson_learned.......:n._deaton	Being lost without a timer for everything!, I purchased this to replace one that jumped into the dishpan......  Having a clock and the ability to time three events at once are great features, but the alarm is too soft. I have hearing problems, but even at a distance to 12-15 inches, the alarm is easy to miss.  Even my sharp eared children agree.  I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.... a lesson learned for me.	0

B000CENF3I:great_seat,_could_be_evn_better:benjamin_humphrey	This is our first and only child seat and has worked quite well for us. We do need to put in a specialized cushon for our baby's head. There have been recent articles warning against letting your baby sleep in a child seat and sine babies' head muscles aren't very strong, the support is a good addition.  I find the triangle grip excellent but even with a small baby in the seat, you will not want to cary this very far at all.  My wife in fact had a back injury carying our son in this seat and that was just from the car to our house !  Some day, these seats may come with some other innovation making them more ergonomic for parents.  I don't know that it would have been different in another seat, but be warned, these things are not meant to actually carry a child by hand and women have weakened muscles after giving birth. It's a terrible combination.  Carying the baby in this seat should be a task for husbands for several months as I found out too late.	1

B0006J31WO:good_idea,_but_does_not_work_well_in_practice:stacey_guth	I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists.	0
B00004CMCD:artists_and_models:w._shriver	After living with this film for 15 years, it seems to me that the best description of its theme comes in the words of the character Liz (Jane Birkin), who in context is speaking of the work of her husband, the painter Frenhofer.  According to her, it concerns something "shameful--it's not the body that is shameful, not the nudity, but something else . . ."	1

6301562178:a_great_family_film:gary_dibert_"the_wessel"	This Picture hit the theaters back in 1975 when a series of disaster films were made. Steve McQueen plays the role of Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorhan, Paul Newman plays the role of Doug Roberts and William Holden plays the role of James Duncan. Roberts is the architect that built the 138 story skyscraper in the heart of the Golden Gate City San Francisco. So James Duncan the owner of the building decides to throw a party inviting over 300 guest to celebrate it's opening. Things start to go wrong when a **** starts in a hall closet. Roberts gets more concern when he fines out that Duncan son in law Roger Simmons has cut cost by putting cheaper wire. Now it becomes Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorham to get the 300 guest out quickly without anyone getting hurt	1
1581348061:very_disappointing.:loves_to_read_"lee"	I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality."  It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women	0

079074192X:should_be_forgotten.:m._case_"sag;_ace;_ase;_dga"	As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity	0

306962	I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.	0
B000BVNSFW:very_good_-__green_tea_frappuccino_addict:mvd	I have used this matcha daily for about 6 weeks now. It is very good for what I use it for. I make my own version of Starbucks Green Tea Frappuccino. (Once that drink name started to roll of my kids' tongues easily - I realized I was spending too much money on these drinks - and daily!)I am not familiar with various grades of matcha, but did not want something pre-sweetened or modified because I wanted to control the sugar, etc. I make my frappuccino like this: sorry - I do not measure - so you may have to modify these amounts because I am guessing!	1
320568	NFSU does capture the idea of 'building and racing cars' but I think they could go a little further into the design of your so-called 'pimp-mobile'. The only interior you get to design is the trunk, I think they could at least do the seats, or the wheel. Outside design is A-OK. Anything from sideskirts to multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce.	1
200760	Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film. In fact, he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long-winded, piecing together as it does the various episodes of Arenas' life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process. At the same time, this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post-revolution persecution experienced by Cubans more effectively than either Carlos Eire's memoir, "Waiting for Snow in Havana", or Hollywood confections such as Sydney Pollack's "Havana" or Richard Lester's "Cuba".	1

This is not a heavy makeup so if you're looking for max coverage this is not for you. I love the mineral glow too. It gives me the perfect glow without looking fake. I will be buying this again	1
22439	I was offered  one of these while cycling and thought it was very tasty.  So good, in fact, that when I got home I went straight to the web site show on the back of the wrapper to learn where I could buy them.  Just above the web address is the nutrition and ingredients list.  That was probably a mistake on the manufacturer's part as it gives you something to read while the site comes up.  OOPS!  This bar has a whooping 25% of your daily allowance of saturated fat!  Not only that, but the fat is palm oil.	0
B0009SV4PS:these_solid_red_sheets_are_a_bright,_pretty_color:linda_l._thorn	I was disappointed at how much these sheets wrinkle in the dryer. I have purchased more reasonably priced bed sheets that were of better quality at half the price of what these were. I bought them because I liked the color, and the red is a very pretty, bright color. I would not recommend buying these unless you like to iron your sheets, or dry them on low heat. The material of the sheets is fairly thin, so I am not sure how long they will last	0

233167	I'm told by fellow film enthusiasts that Buuel's later films do not show this Spanish master at his best, that his earliest films---his famous collaborations with Salvador Dal, for instance---show an edgier, more fascinating Buuel. Whatever. I saw his 1974 film THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY for the first time recently, and I immediately fell in love with it. There are those who swear by his more popular 1972 Oscar-winner THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE, but somehow I think THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY is even more entertaining than DISCREET CHARM.	1

B0002ZJBYE:a_great_gift!:dr._t._simmons	I bought this set for my wife as a valentine's day gift. She really liked them! They are a good size and color, so they give a striking impression from a distance. The earrings come in little plastic ziplock bags all packed inside a not too special velvety bag. If you purchase this as a gift, go the extra step and get something to make a better presentation. I went to wally-world and bought a $3 wooden jewelry box, which conveniently enough had a heart-shaped decorative glass in the top. It was well received.	1

B000F6WMRS:nice_addition_to_back_of_my_suv:elisa_berger	The Organizer works well for keeping disparate shopping items from rolling around in the back of the car.  I do wish the partitions were actually attachable by velcro to the organizer and soft.  The hard plastic partitions is this Organizer are simply square plates that can be stuck in between items.  I tend to not use them since they don't even work to soften the bumps between jossling items. My husband's trunk organizer (which I didn't buy because it cost 3x as much) has the softer, attachable partitions.  I guess that would be worth the money in retrospect for MY needs.  But in all this is great for the price. Now I get to the office, or home, and easily carry everything in at once to unload	1
B0000AKVQA:the_awesomest_shirt_ever!!!:	This is cute, funny, and it's not uncomforable! I think it rocks! I love this movie...I even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth	1
460416	AWFUL!!!  This is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing.  There were two "articles" at the very end of the magazine, and they were awful.  One, on Christmas in the English countryside, should have been beautiful.  Instead, it contained just a few pics and very little text.  What a disappointment.	0
B000000Y7K:a_good_look_at_a_speeding_trane...:"douglasnegley"	Considered one of Coltrane's 'searching' periods, this CD has a lot to offer in the way of understanding Trane's restless nature. Never one to stand on laurels, Coltrane does indeed continue to set the bar 'higher' every time out. This one is mostly ballad and blues based, with the exeption of 2 tracks in particular which stand out - on both ends of the Trane spectrum. Track #2, "I Love You" finds him playing furious, cerebral runs on the instrument, and , frankly, not as 'listenable' as one may like; whereas the track with Donald Byrd is as 'in the pocket' as you'll ever hear. All in all, a very realistic look at a genius in motion	1
350620	If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me	0
B000B8P8VM:beware_this_terrible_software!!!:j._wignall_"jwigs"	Quickbooks "sunsetted" my previous version, forcing me to buy this horriblle, buggy software.  It lacks many of the features that I liked from my previous version (2003), runs much slower, uses 10 times as much memory, and is full of bugs.  I regularly need to run Windows system restore when all of my company data disappears.  Avoid this product at all costs.  Time that I used to spend on more important business functions is now spent trying to get this crappy software to work.  I have used Quickbooks for 12 years, and 4 editions, but this will be my last Intuit product.  I wish I could give it 0 stars	0
B0009OLSY4:nice_toddler_step:l._mazzolini	I like this because it is a nice construction.  I bought the white and it blends in nicely.  I just wish it was a little higher.  We have a newer construction home and the bathroom counters are high so it is still too low for her to wash hands by herself for now.	1

B00022WA9K:can_you_hear_me???:anne_siloy	First of all, let's talk about the noise level on this thing.  YIKES!  That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn't like the brushes at all.  I'll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener.	0
76839	I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB	1
451358	Someone earlier had complained that this lense was suggested to them by amazon and it was the wrong size.  Well, that person isn't alone.  The camera I purchased is a Canon S2is, which I love.  The lense doesn't fit it.  I even bought the hood/lense adapter set and it STILL doesn't fit.  This simply is NOT the right lense for a Canon S2is, no matter what Amazon suggests.  Now, too much time has passed for me to return the lense.  I'm stuck with it, and I don't like that	0
B000BL8QD6:hard_to_take_off!_:cat_goddess	These are by far my favourite yoga pants. Very flattering for practically every sort of figure--but more than that they're SUPER comfy. So stretchy that they feel like a second skin. And the foldover waist is very flattering with just a hint of support if you're self-conscious about your belly. Plus you can unfold it during your practice if you feel your T-shirt riding up. And sheer enough so you can slip a skirt over them after yoga class and you're good to go back on the street!	1
B0001N3ZRQ:why_can_i_not_find_good_dvd_storage:mad_g.i.	This is just a general review, of all DVD cases. I have not found any that even come close to meeting my needs. I was stationed in Germany for over 2 years, and anyone who had been there knows that AFN sucks, so DVD's is your only source of video entertainment. My collection grew to more than 400. I have been trying to find a good case, that hold equal number of title books as it does DVD's. But that seems to be asking to much, or the manufacturers know that by giving odd numbers, you will have to buy more of the product to support your collection properly?????  Then when you look at the furniture options, everything seems to be made for function, and not style at all, they are generally pressboard P.O.S's and nothing I would want to keep in my garage.......... I hope that some of the manufacturers read this and come up with real solutions, cause there is definately a market out there that is waiting to be satisfied!!!!!	0
B0000BWVAC:not_the_same...:rick_"rdthomp17"	When Pokemon first debuted, I thought it would rock, and Misty, Brock, and Ash would stay together as a gang forever, and Ash would love it to just be walking around the world, earning badges, etc., and that's the way it would stay. Maybe even Ash and MIsty would fall in love! But, nope. The dudes who are creating these movies are sucking kids in with exclusive Pokemon cards, and the animation is just getting cheaper. This movie is totally different from the original movies and the TV series, and it sucks. I'll hold on to the older series and DVD's, but, nowadays, Brock and Misty are gone, and it's just boring without them. For those who agree with me, get the message out there that Pokemon is going down the tubes and it stinks. Bring back Brock and Misty!!! IT WILL SAVE THE SERIES! Oh, and I'm only giving this movie two stars because they went so far as to make a movie about something so ridiculous, with so much change, and so little things the same. :-( Boo	0

B000FJQBHM:good_flavors:adobe_princess_"laura"	These are good to keep on hand for hiking for that quick energy and I also try to keep some of these or a smiliar product in my purse if my blood sugar drops.  I am not a diabetic, but I have gotten low blood sugar my whole life and when I get it I use this or something else to get it back up fast so I can be comfortable.  This really works and tastes great too.  They really did well with this product.  I like to go geocaching and I get out for a long while on hikes this is great to have in the backpack when I need quick fuel	1

B000HAR8UI:acer_22"_black_is_a_winner.:ronald_l._boring_"ronnie_bee"	Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing.	1

B000NY8IVG:great_for_a_busy_professional:curlygirl719_"loves_to_twirl"	This is a great product for a busy professional or grad student who gives their Mac a lot of mileage.  I'm in law school, so I'm constantly throwing my computer in my bag along with heavy casebooks, keys, and other junk.  My old iBook survived tremendous abuse, and after two years looked like it had been through a war.  The Speck case protects the MacBook's shell and even the screen, in a roundabout way.  Normally, if you put a Mac into a briefcase or bag with heavy books, the books will press against the shell, and the screen inside will press against the keys leaving dents and screwing the the LCD.  The Speck case is very stiff, so even the heaviest books and the worst abuse don't push the screen onto the keyboard.  Plus, if you put a red case on a white Mac, people will think you're in some secret club that has access to red Macs.	1
392724	The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself	0
B000IOQ0KW:good_versatile_jogger:s._clary	This is a good jogger if you will be using it for more than just jogging.  I really like the fact that it has a front swivel wheel that you can lock for jogging and unlock if you need more manuverability.  It comes with cup holders, which is nice because a lot of joggers you need to puchase them as an accessory.  Overall it is a good stroller, the only thing that I would change in the design would be the wheel locking feature.  It has 2 individual locks, one for each wheel.  The jogger I had previously had a bar across the back that would lock both wheels at the same time when pressed.  I am extremely satified with the stroller for the price at which I purchased it	1
B000HAU972:great_video,_poor_audio:mark_c._cooperider	Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch	0
B000667W2W:a_struggle_to_reel_up:nhhun	After buying two automatic retractable Hozelock 50 foot hoses (that we love) I bought this for the extra hose length.  It is a very disappointing unit.  It tends to bounce around when you are pulling out the hose and can be a pain reeling it back up.   I am a big guy and still struggle with it.  Pull the nozzle back to the unit as instructed and then sit on it as you crank.	0
0806512091:first_book_of_his_that_i_read:	I must have missed something about this book.  I can't believe that Minority Report and Total Recall, two movies that I did enjoy, came from this author.  The stories seem to be missing something.  Perhaps, this version should not have been the first works by this author for me to have read	0

B000BVWVUA:would_be_perfect_with_a_few_small_modifications:nursesmartypants	As everyone else has indicated, programming isn't intuitive.  The opening was larger than necessary and my cats learned to stick their paws up inside the machine to steal more food within a few days.  We blocked off half of the food shute by using two very small screws and heavy duty plastic and the cats were no longer able to sneak food between feedings.  Prior to using this feeder, the cats would wake us up at the crack of dawn, crying for food.  Now, they associate feedings with the machine and leave us to sleep in peace!  Well worth the money for us!!	1

B000308F9U:ms-5700_needs_to_go_back_to_the_drawing_board:donald_g._bellio	I have found that the MS-5700 to be very loud. The Braun 8995 that I replaced it with is very quiet. The plastic chrome on the body gives it a very cheap feel, and look, it makes it hard to hold onto. I have found that the shaver dosn't give me a very close shave compared to the Braun 8985 shaver. The solution tank for the cleaner seems to be not as user friendly as the Braun 8985 that holds a cartridge that slips in and out to replace. As you have read I have replaced the MS-5700 already with the Braun 8985, and am very happy with the change. The Braun also came with 3 cartridges for the cleaner unit, not just one bottle to pour into the cleaner.	0
B0009HXWCM:animal_sounds_don't_work_after_two_months_of_play:deborah_k._currie_"debbie"	This was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son.  Unfortunately, the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play, and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later.  Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too.  He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet	0
0764588079:errors,_errors,_errors...:milan_m._blake_"knight's"	This book has too many errors. There is nothing more frustrating than to follow the steps outlined and find out it does not work because they did not Q&A the examples.	0
B00003CWQR:a_frank_peek_into_their_tumultuous_lives.:jenny_j.j.i._"a_new_yorker"	How good is Angelina Jolie in this film? It is a testament to this young actor's presence that even as dark and soul sickened and gloriously decaying as her character is, there is not a frame in this film that doesn't feel her infection.	1
B00023IY2Q:clinique_happy_heart_perfume:lori_v._turner	I was very pleased with this purchase. The perfume arrived packaged nicely and was actually bigger than I expected 1 oz. to be.  I love the scent and will definately buy more when this one is gone!  Great experience with Amazon	1

The battery that comes with it is good for a couple of hours continuous recording and the tapes only last for one hour.  I acquired a second battery that is good for 240+ minutes so I never worry about running out of juice.  I have only two complaints really, one minor and one major.	0

Spend a little more and get the fabric or silcon style instead	0

0807829587:evans_should_update_his_book!_the_south_is_no_longer_'fiddler_on_the_roof'!:helene_hoffman	I am a Jew living in a college town in Mississippi for the past 5 years. I was born & raised in the North. I think Evans should rename his book "Fiddler on the Roof in the South". His book is a very nostalgic look back at Jewish history - as it was in the past here. It's very much: the southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil rights.	0
B0002U3QQ8:mattress_is_like_sleeping_on_a_rock:j._lien	I loved this item at face value - it looks good, the materials are good quality, it feels secure, and the premise of the functionality of the bed was what I wanted because I planned on breastfeeding my newborn and wanted her close by. I was proud of my purchase and showed it to many of my friends before the baby came.  Well, the "mattress" that comes with it is so hard that my baby won't sleep in it. She won't nap in it, and when I put her down all she does is cry.  I've tried everything to get her to sleep in this thing because it would be so helpful if she would, but she won't sleep in it at all.  I've even tried making it softer by putting blankets down on the board of a mattress and covering this with a receiving blanket that I tuck in the sides (something I don't want to do because of the SIDS factor) and that doesn't even help - it's still too hard of a surface.  Now, my baby is sleeping in bed with me and I can't get any sleep because I'm afraid of rolling over on her or her rolling off of the bed.  If they'd just make the mattress more comfortable for the baby, this would be a perfect product and I'd rate it a 5, but because it's virtally useless to me and my baby due to the mattress/board, I have to rate it only 2 stars.  I'm so let down by this product	0

B000DN84A2:nice_product:c._chiu_"palm_worker"	The product is compact and convenient, but it feels flimsy.  The hotsync function stopped working for a bit but was restored after I did a hard reset of my Palm TX--so it was not a cable problem but a problem with my TX.  For some reason, the cable won't let me charge using the USB wall-charger I got for my wife's iPod, but it does charge the TX off my computer's USB port (which is a Powerbook G4--notorious for being underpowered)	1

B00004R6WE:not_remotely_as_good_as_the_book!:j._chambers	I might have enjoyed this movie more if they hadn't gutted the book, which was a pretty good read. The best character in the book, FBI Special Agent Pendergast, isn't even in the movie, and New York City police Lt. D'Agosta is just a comic caricature of the book's character.	0

It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.

253699	Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.	0

I was aiming to the plastic made products with the replaceable cutters, but I recall my school had an old beat up trimmer and it seemed to still cut good.

335159	This film is evocative of the quirky, madcap Robert Altman at his best and worst.  We got it because we have a Bud Cort fan in the family, and just to see him makes it worth it.  But the story is strange, resolution less than satisfying.  If you're really a big Altman or Cort fan, then you must see it.  Just be aware that THIS IS NOT A WESTERN!  (I had it confused with John Wayne's &quot;Rooster Cogburn&quot; and the Dennis Weaver's &quot;McCloud&quot; and kept waiting for it to start, thinking I was seeing more previews.)  The storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the Astrodome who is trying to fly, with a murder mystery and detective story.  This is one of Shelly Duvall's early roles -- don't miss her upside-down false eyelashes	0
45862	I like using a tripod with my long zoom lens, and this device has really added to my hobby.  The remote is perfect for taking pictures of birds in my birdbath and squirrels and other critters in my yard.  I personally don't like cables, I don't like dealing with them.  This is just right for my purposes.	1
B00004S5FA:don't_quit_your_day_job,_norman!:dawn_woodruff_"hardew2"	Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this &quot;stuff&quot; had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired	0
B000000WH5:no_glory_here:charles_h._levenson_"chubbybuns"	Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer	0
B00005UO3W:nature's_ways:evan_moy	The movie "Days of Heaven," written by Terrence Malic, is a movie of transcendentalism, anti-transcendentalism, and nature. In class, we have been discussing the term transcendentalism. Also we have talked about how nature cannot be destroyed or stopped. Nature itself balances out life. From a meteor crashing to earth wiping out all life, to a simple hurricane wiping out a whole city and killing thousands, nature cannot be inverted and prevented. In the movie "Days of Heaven," this idea is clearly shown. The scene where the locusts were eating the crops is the prime example in this movie to me of how nature will always have its ways of evening things out. When life starts to get ahead, when things are going well for everyone, something always seems to happen. In this movie, everything was going well for everybody. This is when nature comes into play. Locusts come to eat all crops. This is nature acting in response to the success of humans. What this says is that no matter how powerful humans are, the machines we have, or the ideas we come up with, nothing stands up to nature.	1
179057	I have been a Barry Manilow fan since I was a teenager.  I have NEVER been disappointed with any of his work and this CD is no exception!  He is such a brilliant arranger and the remix of these classics is fabulous!  His voice is as good as ever!  Even my 7 year old begs to listen to the CD everytime we get in the car and she can sing all the words!	1

377824	This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.	0

B000CSBZLI:the_warrant_isn't_worth_the_paper_it_is_printed_on:1+twins=my_3_boys	My husband bought me this camera for my birthday in May 2006.  I loved this camera.

When I removed the camera that evening, the screen remained black.  It would not take any pictures.	0
B000MFO0BI:incorrect_item:debbie_kustra	Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.  I printed it out so I can fax it, scan it & email it, or snail mail it, or however you would like to receive it.  Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls	0

B000KFWUMG:great_device_but_not_so_satisfied_with_the_phone_part:s._hussain	I recently got the 8525 and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do.

309632	It used to be (and it has been a couple years since I have bought a computer game new) that as long as your PC was not too old, you could run any game on it.  No so with Oblivion (and some other new games I believe).  To run Oblivion (as is) you need a machine with a high end graphics card.  So unless you bought a PC specifically for gaming, or specifically updated the graphics card, Oblivion will just quit after the intro screen, without telling you why!  While I readily accept that not having a high end graphics card will mean that games will not look as good, it is frustrating that this game will not even run on my PC (a dual core, with 1G of RAM).  And no, it still does not run if you install the manufacturer's patch.	1

B000KX28CA:good_and_slick_case:b._c._bedel	This is a great case. I have had no problems with it, and works very well. It's also very "sexy" if you want to put it that way, and looks really cool. Only trouble I have is that when I open it sometimes, it'll make a click sound because 2 pieces touch, but its very minor and does no damage. It's a great item! However, if you intend to bang your laptop around a lot, I'd recommend one of those soft outer cases too, because this is not intended to protect the hard drive etc. Just protect it from scratches and smudges. I recommend it highly	1

B0007CXT68:it_works!:marlene	Sorry to see the other poor reviews of this product, because we think this is the best thing since sliced bread!  We bought four of these pest repellers and found that they kill all the flies and spiders in the house.  We have lots of plants that are breeding grounds for fruit flies; this product disrupts their teeny little lives, and no sooner are some hatched than they disappear.  We have to vacuum up the dead house flies and spiders periodically, and we have Black & Decker to thank!  I'm buying more--for the rest of the house and garage and for gifts	1
B00083ET92:terrific_product:ihateworking	I am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try.  I have a six-year old Hitachi DVD player, and I lost the remote.  I couldn't play anything without it, because the buttons on the player don't allow me to select any tracks.  The instructions on this remote are incredibly easy.  It found my TV automatically, because it's set for a Sony TV by default.  When I had to locate a code for my DVD player, I got worried-- none of the 3 Hitachi DVD codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process.  But there's a search function to use in that situation, which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip's library till one works.  It found one within seconds, and I was up and running.  I think I'm going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms	1

Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.	0
B00007L12U:awesome_!:lisa_avilio-meyer	I added this toy to my son's xmas list. With much luck he did get it; and we are pleased ! I would not say that it's a "fun to play with" toy but the entertainment value still exists. The planets are large enough without being overbearing up on the ceiling. They glow at night..which is the best part !! At 36 years old I can't wait for  nighttime to hang in my sons room to check out the  planets!  The stars the set comes with are perfect. They are NOT the bulky plastic ones that can be seen day or night. They are paper stickers that disappear during the day (on the celing they do anyway) The planets come with name stickers which adds educational value. My son is five and LOVES, LOVES, LOVES these planets. I say get 'em !!	1
B0005YYD7C:a_culinary_masterpiece:	The lovely thing about Ramen Noodles is that they take three minutes to cook and three minutes to eat and one doesn't usually find themselves wanting to vomit afterwards.

B000K0YFRY:avoid_unless_you_like_to_be_told_how_to_think:sadie_delaney_"dog_lover"	Unless you want the Editor's liberal political views SHOVED down your throat, avoid this magazine.  It leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it.  (And no, I am NOT a Republican or Democrat, but an Independent who looks at all sides).  The Editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the Democrats back in power, he bashes Bush and the Republican party over the head with a 10-ton hammer on a monthly basis, yet worships eco-phonies like Laurie David and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco-friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets. (I understand Laurie and her friends like Sheryl Crow ARE "trying" to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss-crossing the country instead, but that poor Laurie is finding this hard to give up.  What hyprocrites these Hollywood folks are!)  Though I am personally trying to do my bit for the environment, I hate when I read issues like the current "Green" issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us "common people" to make the changes. This used to be a great fashion, entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in-depth articles, but now it is only a political platform publication.  I now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when I receive it, until my subscription expires	0
B0007XCT0E:d-link_customer_service_is_terrible:netizen_fair	I have a DCS-900W camera that failed within a year. After that, I made 7 calls to their customer service and tried to get it returned and replaced. Obviously I was talking to some indian people overseas that don't seem to care about the "service" that much, and usually after a couple of transfers, the line got cut off or picked up by another layman. During conversation, the line quality is very bad.	0
B000BPUHIO:poorly_made:goldilocks_"katie"	These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.	0

B000AP2Z9O:split_personality:adam_capps_"electropop_fiend"	The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare.

B000GDCTIM:i_like_it.:justin_a._tilley	The sword itself is awesome to behold. Though the guard was only minorly spot welded and is loose from just a few minutes of play. No, I didn't hit anything. Blade is heavy, would look good if it were not scratched so bad. Can be polished up. If you know people to repair this, I suggest you do so. Cool sword, Chinese craftsmanship. Should you buy it? Hell yeah	1
126159	The POWER-2000 XP-333 charges batteries in pairs, with one LED per pair, not as described.  The XP-555 charges each battery independently and slightly faster (3 vs 4 hours).  The XP-333 charger is very lightweight, the XP-555 is slightly heavier.   They work on 110 or 220 V and includes plug adaptors for round European type plugs.  I have used the XP-333 in the USA and overseas.  POWER-2000 makes several other charger models as well.	1
348951	I got this CD after seeing what I remembered as a decent video on Fuse TV.  Maybe I was half-asleep, because after listening to this ho-hum entry into the world of emo copycats, I can't even remember or recognize which song it was.  This album is ultimately forgettable-- better off listening to any Jimmy Eat World CD again and again, which is actually an enjoyable experience	0

Levi's, shorts, dress or trucker's overhauls, it makes no difference. The whole rest of the world might not know what you have on under there, but you'll know and that's enough to add a certain blush to your face, let me tell you. They made me feel ready for bed all day long	1
044041668X:excellently_written_(except_in_one_crucial_part):pamela_w._richmond_"pamlovesbjihc"	First, the story takes place in the 1940s (Harold's brother is MIA in WWII, not in Vietnam, as the Amazon.com review erroneously states).  Second, the writing is superb.  Mr. Lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel.  His characters are very real.  His setting (a small, struggling circus, traveling the western U.S.) is historically believable, peopled with 'freaks' who  suffer as sideshows, unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with, but peopled also with 'normals' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks.  Harold, the 14-year-old albino central character, tries to straddle both groups of people.  He finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer.  I am admittedly ignorant about such things, but Mr. Lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants--crucial to the plot of the novel--seem believable.  My only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end.  I do want you to read this book, so I will try not to give anything away here, but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character's last words and even Gomer Pyle-like (People actuallly say "Gosh!").  This did detract from the impact of the death, unfortunately, but I still very strongly recommend this book.  Five stars for a book with a major flaw says a lot!	1

After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results	0

I though this would save me money because until then I had been just buying new copies of my favorite CDs that were scrathced up. I cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three "processes" without successful results. It didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs. I dont think this is a good "repairer" of any disc thats more than mildly scratched. My suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your CD or DVD on AMAZON!!

B0009I46TY:you_either_hate_it_or_love_it:j._chen	I heard this song on the radio the first time many months ago (and then for months and months it's been played nonstop).  I instantly hated it from the horrendous beat to the fact that Gwen Stefani is a 35 year old dressed up as a cheerleader with pom-poms and about 95% of the song is spent on the chorus "I ain't no hollaback girl" or "This s*** is bananas" section.  Pharell is a master producer and I chuckled because I thought that even the Neptunes can produce an occasional flop.  To my horror this song became the number one single for multiple weeks and became the most successful single of the entire summer (maybe even the entire year).  I don't see what people like about this song but apparently there is something I'm missing.  Like I said you either hate it or love it	0
147652	The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. What's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening.

B00023XK52:runs_too_long,_but_acting_is_good...:heather_cuoio_"helycu72"	I just finished watching Callie and Son. I got my copy from the Dollar Store and it has another movie (Power Passion and Murder) with Michelle Pfeiffer in it as well... It really wasn't that bad, considering the price I paid. Lindsay Wagner is actually the main character and I think she did a great job, as did most of the actors in this film. The only trouble is the movie lasted about a hour longer than it needed to. With a bit of editing and a bit better script, it would have been a great movie! The end was somewhat unexpected and horrifying... I'd recommend it for someone to watch once, but I wouldn't pay more than I did for it. The DVD quality is really poor, the sound fades in and out, but for what it was, a bargain bin cheapy, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.	1
B000EPFEPC:i_wish_i_could_give_it_a_negative_5_stars...:maa_"maa"	This game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes.  Also, if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again.  It's a huge waste of money.  For 30.00 they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the DVD or have more than one DVD included in the game.	0

I contacted the Luigi Bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses.  When they arrived, however, they were the wrong glasses.  I returned them to the company, along with the broken glasses I had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses.  Again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again.  I would highly recommend these glasses and this company	1

Naturalizer runs very, very narrow. I love, love these shoes. I can dance all night without pain =) They are very cushioned, the top straps do not cut at all, and the heel height is super comfortable - more like a 2" heel. I so wish i could find these in other colors in WW!	1

B000B8KABU:should_this_be_legal?:jesse_ravenscroft_"dogg_pound"	I've been using TrimSpa X32 for over a year and, with a decent diet and regular excersise, I've lost over 40 pounds. The X32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all. I, too, decided to use TrimSpa Energy because it was new and improved, but was sorely disappointed. The Engergy formula is way too high powered (200mg Caffeine per pill) for me and has made me feel "sped-up", sweaty, greasy and just plain gross. And that's taking under the suggested dosage. I'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you...at the expense of dilated pupils, shaky hands and acting sketchy. I don't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings. I'm going back to the other formula tomorrow...that is if I can get to sleep!	0

56080	I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends	0

B000F4OFIY:weather_station:kenct_"ken"	This little weather station works well and is pretty simple to set up. You will have to read the instructions to get the remote sensor to sync, but otherwise easy.  I found this to be one of the better looking units from OS. It has medium size numbers and is easy to read.  By reading barometric pressure and outdoor temp and humidity, it does a pretty good job of predicting weather. In order to get outside temp there is a remote sensor.  To be effective you need to mount it in a shady area with a screw.  Also the instructions suggest the more expensive lithium batteries (not included) for the remote sensor because alkaline batteries will only measure temps down to just below freezing, then the batteries freeze. Lithium batteries will allow temp readings all the way down to a chilly -22.  My only disappointment with this unit is the main display is not wall mountable, only desk stand. Also the radio signal for the clock setting comes and goes	1
276840	This book has been golden for two of my undergrad communications classes and is turning out an invalvuable reference for my graduate level comm class, which the professor is teaching from a variety of books.

377480	No other game looks or plays like this; The missions and locations are varied and colorful; The villians range from a fat guy with dynamite strapped to his person to corrupt law officials; And, as usual, Rockstar keeps the game play challenging but not overly frustrating; Lots of unlockables offer high replay. This is one of the most unique and best looking games on any system, period. I still throw this one in every 6 months for another go thru. The story is straightforward and engaging; Lots of really interesting concepts(machinegun in the coffin, crazy midgets, that whole 'dead-eye' thing...)and it controls very well. Another great game from an outstanding company. Hopefully a sequel is in the works.	1

B0001MSDOC:be_ware_of_spouts_for_olive_oil:l._harris_"skytag"	I understand the appeal of having the convenience of a spout on a bottle of oil, but be aware that the spout will allow air into the bottle. You may think air only gets in when you pour oil out, but that's not true. Any time the temperature rises, the air in the bottle expands and some escapes through the spout. When the temperature drops, air enters the spout. This is true of even small changes in temperature such as you experience in a kitchen. If you don't use the oil pretty quickly this constant exchange of air will expose the oil to oxygen and that will cause the oil to go rancid.	0

B0002473GS:great_drive_so_far.:r._c._lewis	I just purchased this item two days ago (Thurs.) Today (Sat.) I removed my 160GB Seagate HHD from my Kingwin enclosure and installed it in this one. Installation was not a problem although the molex connector seems to be a tight fit and is almost touching the fan. Fan noise does not seem to be a problem yet. I used the Firewire connection instead of USB and the drive access is much faster than it was with the USB connection on the other enclosure. The price is a little steep compared to others but I got a generous rebate offer with my purchase.

I put the sensor out on the upstairs patio in the late afternoon until I figured out where I would be able to put it. We had on unexpected rain that night and the thermometer no longer read.. I wished I had paid extra for a weather proof one. I took the batteries out and let the sensor dry out for a couple days, put it back together and it worked and has worked ever since. I didn't think the sensor would read from my upstairs back bedroom to the downstairs patio but it does	1
B00005CDSF:clumsy:elaine_wong	This is not one of the best hair dryers I've had.  At best, it's average.  The nozzle is too long, and the concentrator attachment is fixed at horizontal.  I like attachments that can rotate so that I can change the angle to reach different parts of my hair.  The ionic feature makes no difference to the length of drying time or texture of my hair.  After using this hair dryer for 1 yr and 3 mths (about 3X a week), the switch for heat settings is now loose.  The dryer only blows cool air even though I slide the switch for higher temperatures.

B00009N7HH:excellent_air_circulation_for_entire_house!_soothing_sound.:c._koronkiewicz	I purchased this fan for my teenage son who like the drone of a fan to sleep. I have since purchased another one to put at the top of my stairs to help circulate the air from the downstairs since we have no ceiling fans. My son loves how much air this baby pumps out and the steady hum has been a wonderful plus, saying he hasn't slept this good in a long time.  the 2nd fan has done wonders for the house circulation and I too have come to enjoy sleeping with it on in my bedroom.  Very sturdy steel construction, easy assembly of the legs. 3 speeds. Top speed is out of this world. Almost like a wind storm. Me and my boys actually ripped up tissue paper and had a ball putting it in front of the fan and watching them swirl all over the house. What a riot!  I highly recommend this fan for excellent air circulation, sleep aid and some silly fun	1

B00019G4TQ:russians_love_a_good_soap_just_like_us:justine_cardello	I first saw this movie around 1980, when the Cold War was still on. I had been inundated with propaganda from birth, that all Russians talked about was political, that they didn't do "normal" things or live a normal life. All politics you know. Well, here was this movie about the lives and loves of three women. It was very well acted, and basically, just a long soap! I loved it--and not one word about Lenin, Marx, or anti-Americanisms. I recently saw it again, and liked it just as much. For those who say it is unrealistic--well, how do you know? Do you think that all Russians lived the exact same life? Or because American Cold War propaganda stated that all Russians were totally miserable	1

81042	Despite all of the controversy over its violent content, the Grand Theft Auto series of videogames deliver time after time with the best entertainment bang for your buck. In my opinion Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is the best game out of the series so far. Yes, the missions are a bit easier than those in San Andreas, but Vice City is a better overall experience. The setting is beautiful, there are more properties that you can own, and the automotive,firearm and weapon selections are also quite large. The soundtrack to this game is amazing. From 80's pop to metal to old school rap and hillarious talk radio, its all here. Grand Theft Auto is the greatest videogame series ever because it combines fun, challenges, and elements of real life triumphs and consequences in one well produced package	1

520720	Dave Barry has written and selected an extremely humorous collection of his articles from The Miami Herald.  There is a huge margin in difference of quality in Boogers are My Beat than in his initial non fiction books such as Dave Barry's Bad Habits.

B000LHMNVQ:women's_under_armour_tech_tee_:tiffany	This tee-shirt is my first Under Armour purchase, and I took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any Under Armour before.  I'm not dissatisfied, but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt.  On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in "hand" is worth the added function of "wicking" in this instance.  Overall, I consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour-long run, but I wouldn't want to spend a lot of extended time in it.	1

I would describe it as Maxim's younger brother.  It's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school, and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny, etc., but it is forced and very juvenile.  It just is snarky and predictable after awhile.  On the other hand, I'm not 21 anymore either, and maybe if I was in my 20's I would find this the height of humor	0

B00005AQ9C:pretty_good_for_the_price:seagrass_chik_"diverdownbelow"	I have been using this scope on the beach at night to monitor sea turtle nesting. When up close, the image is excellent, but not so good for far away (more than 100-200 ft). Very easy to use, and the fact that it's waterproof is a plus (haven't dropped it in the ocean yet!). You can't really get a feel for how good the image is in a residential area, but out on the beach, with the moonlight, it rocks. Most of the time I don't even need the IR illuminator. To save power, turn it off, and it will still provide an image with the available light for almost 5 minutes. If you're looking to see things that are far away, this scope won't work well, but for things that are close by (say, from one end of the backyard to the other) it's a good deal. I put mine in a hard sided padded carrying case, since it gets bounced around on the ATV, and haven't had a problem yet	1

B000HQJWAQ:very_good_cereal:m._l._kent	This cereal is not quite as hearty as some muesli I am used to, but is excellent. Many characteristics on the plus side: is truly multigrain (contains wheat, oat, corn, rice, barley and millet), is sweetened only just enough to appeal to the palate - which is to say it is not horribly sweet like the common American breakfast cereal, is light and crispy with some of the ingredients powdery so they tend to combine with milk and make it thicker, and does in fact have a nice light blueberry flavor. The only aspect I'm not thrilled about is that the raisins and almonds are scarce compared to the excellent, less expensive muesli-type cereal I buy at the local Aldi. This Nature's Path cereal has a corn-flake-like chip predominant, as shown on the box	1

B00004GP0U:truly_doesn't_serve_its_purpose.:carrie	So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.	0

0790743353:you_want_a_sock_on_the_button?:rocco_dormarunno	Cagney's startling performance as Tommy Powers, in William Wellman's PUBLIC ENEMY, was to be expected. He was powerful when needed. Gentle, with his short jabs of affection. And his fast-talking wit, whether in anger or in good-spirits, was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars. Or was it to be expected in 1931? I didn't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star Edward Woods was supposed to be the lead, and that Cagney was to play Matt. At the last minute, in movie minutes, the roles were switched. And yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts. (Edward Woods was incredibly underrated. Does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938? He lived for decades after that.)	1
B000KFUK9Q:i_was_dubious,_but_it's_great.:scout	I've had several gens of the candybar blackberries, 7100 nice but reception/mike was horrendous, 7130 much better, finally nailed it. Was dubious when I had to take a pearl when my 7130 went funky.... but I'll give it the full thumbs up now. Slightly smaller than 7130, which oddly does make a difference, like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something. Makes my partner's Treo look like a firstgen cell in comparison. Unobtrustive in yr pocket. The "pearl" trackball is just fine, like it better than roller actually. Reception, mike quality are also good, despite concerns that they were reviewed worse than the 7130. Writing is good too, the suretype continuing to be so durn accurate I sometimes forget to check. And hey, I like having the camera. So, I thought the 7130 was my perfect smartphone, the one that I just stopped thinking about cause it did it all just great.... but actually... I like the Pearl better. If you need bulletproof email, PDA, and phone, this is yr baby. Slightly shorter battery life, but hasn't stranded me yet.	1
B000GB0TMW:high_shipping,_no_cute_tin,_but_great_product:amy	Bought to use in a cheesecake recipe that we've been enjoying for a year now using instant powder subsitutes...this is a reasonably-priced nice-sized sample to use. $5 shipping is a bit goofy for a soft 1-oz. packet of powder, but luckily I had a gift certificate. I look forward to trying different recipes with this. Cheesecake tastes good, a lot earthier/more organic now that we have the real matcha. I think I'll try making iced lattes now. Too bad it didn't come in the cute little round tin that they show it in...that was an appealing package but the resealable soft packet is nice too	1
6304501978:italians_do_it_better-just_ask_sophia!:eric_marshall	Sophia Loren is without arugment the most beautiful and sexy foreign actress in movie history. Beginning in the mid-1950's she did a string of Italian films and became the first foreign-born actress to come to Hollywood and make the crossover in mainstream American movies, starting with "The Pride and the Passion" in 1957 (it was this film and "Houseboat" that Loren began her close relationship with Cary Grant) and at the same time, blew fellow Italian bella Gina Lollobridga out of the water as the best actress to come out of Italy. In 1960, Loren went back to Italy to film the World War II film "Two Women." A year and a half later, to everybody's surprise she won the Oscar for Best Actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the Academy Award. But if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy Sophia Loren was, it came with "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow." The scene in which she strips in front of Marcello Mastronini's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too (Hope PREMIERE magazine does a list like it someday). And that is the scene in which you say to everybody, "This is Sophia Loren." In my opinion, Loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on-screen in their lingerie. There is a shirt that says, "Italians Do it Better." Could 'it' be referring to sex? if so, we can give thanks to Sophia Loren.	1
288936	This movie shows the real life hell that was Andersonville.  A prison camp that turned into a death camp. Not enough food,water or shelter for all the prisoners sent there.

B000H8ZXWA:good_computer_screen_quality,_but....:confederate	I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.	0

B000J14NLW:not_enough_strength_or_grip...:s._albertini_"speedwell"	I got one of these to help me after I had major surgery.  I have better than average hand and arm strength, but I found this particular model to be hard to operate (I can't imagine how someone with a weak grip could possibly use it).  Normal sized cans (like soup or beans) slipped out of its pitiful grip.  I wound up using it just to roll things to myself when I dropped them and for picking up clothes for the wash.  This is definitely a lightweight... too light for much real use.  I should have bought the heavier duty version for just a few dollars more	0
B000CDRB7A:i_literally_just_put_it_on_minutes_ago:n._kinney	First of all let me preface this by stating that I literally just put this product on minutes ago. I have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given Retin A and therefore my face was peeling so horribly, that I thought I couldn't leave the house. I mean my makeup would literally come right off. I was horrified! I tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk, so I researched this and went to Sephora and bought a kit. I washed my face, did the serum and added this product and I honestly do not see 1 single flake of dry skin, it does tingle but I think it's because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water. I am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. I have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years. I decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then I was so dry for 2 wks I couldn't bare to even look at myself. My skin doesn't hurt anymore, for allthe sensitive people, there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat, this is the product for you. If it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt. Or just once a day. I hope you find this product helpful like I did becaus I am still looking in the mirrow that's at my desk	1

This stuff is amazing, I have seen a flash go off while I pass trough speed camera.  It's been almost 2 months and I still didn't get any ticket.  I think everyone should protect themselves with the reflector cover because the cameras are there to collect revenue instead of protecting the public	1

6708	Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get	0

Well, let me just say that this is the best gift I got this year even though it only came in my stocking. I have had more fun with the Jellifish than with anything else I got this year -- I'm just fascinated that this little guy can change your tone so big! Anywho, I would say that it's definitely not for beginners. You need to be a real player to understand how to use it. Why didn't somebody come out with something like this a long time ago is what I'm wondering! Is there a user group for sharing tips and licks	1

019283603X:another_excellent_collection_of_literary_brain-teasers:holly_m._kent_"holly_kent"	Lovers of Mr. Rochester beware - in this, his second book of literary puzzles, John Sutherland turns his considerable powers of literary analysis towards, amongst other things, undoing the good reputation enjoyed by Jane Eyres brooding hero. Bronte fans, brace yourself for some idol-smashing. As in his first book of devoted to literary head-scratchers (the wonderful Is Heathcliff a Murderer?), Sutherland here sets himself out to answer some of Western literatures most intriguing questions. Though you might not always agree with some of the conclusions Sutherland comes to (we have to have a talk, he and I, about Mr. Rochesters moral integrity) as a writer he is always witty, as a thinker always innovative, and as a guide through literatures most baffling conundrums, always genial. Buy this book and I promise not only will you learn something (and, if youre anything like me, get into some very heated debates with fellow literature lovers about Jane Eyres prospects for bliss, etc.) - but youll also have a heck of a lot of fun	1

But she forgot to mention, the thing can cause your feet to get sore! I tried wearing high quality running shoes and it still hurt. I received an advice to attatch foam strips to the runners that you stand on, and that has solved the problem! So far, I have not used the pistons, so it's just a cardio workout. I have Tony's tapes he sells on his website and his music cd's, and I do get a very good workout! I have lost 13 pounds so far by using it, and I noticed it defanitely toned up the buns	1

That changed this past weekend when I saw the revival of Normal Heart currently playing off-Broadway. This is a viscerally emotional piece of theatre and it makes one feel impassioned about what was going on in the world then and sheds a new light as to what's going on now in regards to the HIV/AIDS crisis. It's a must red if you don't have a chance to see it	1
445938	I just got this item (from ebay, it's cheaper)and feel it's worthy of praise.  I have thick, straight hair, and bought this product to wave my hair.  I haven't figured out how it curls, but to wave it's incredibly easy!  Grab your hair from the root and twist outward and it waves nice and fast w/o burning your hair like a curling iron would.  Also w/ a curling iron, it's difficult to wave the top close to the roots.   It heats fast!  and comes w/ a nice pouch so that you can put it away before it cools.	1
B0002RQYKQ:a_big_improvement!:big_j_"a_big_kid"	This large version of Michael Myers is a lot beter than the McFarlane version released ever how many years ago. First the pose is better.Second NO BLOOD STAINS! Don't get me wrong, Michael Myers is a movie killer, but he never got bloody! That was my biggest complaint with the McFarlane version. He does have slight oily looking stains on his coveralls, but if you remember from the movie, he killed a mechanic to get those coveralls. Finally third, and pretty cool, the sound effect is diffrent. Instead of Laurie Strode's whiny help me , you get the Halloween theme playing along with Michael's breathing. Remeber the end of the first movie, after Loomis shot him, but the body was missing, the closing shots were shown with the theme music accompanied by Myers' breathing. If you got the NECA boxed set of Michael Myers and Loomis and liked it, get this! If you got the Mcfarlane version, get this! If you just like Halloween, get this! You won't be disappointed! Looks better in person than on the picture	1
B0007KPC60:hate_huggies:shawna_b._lorz	When I gave birth I had already bought packages of newborn huggies. They were horrible. I thought once my boys got older that maybe huggies would work then. NOPE. I've tried Huggies Supreme and the cheap huggies. They are both made horribly and after your child goes in them once they sag so bad you have to go change them. I thought since everyone always talks about pull-ups that they would work once potty training time came around. WRONG AGAIN. They leaked evertime he wore them. Do not waste you money. I always ended up going back to the pampers swaddlers, cruisers, and training pants. Pampers are the best.	0
578538	I purchased this album because I am a fan of the Last Poets.  Upon listening to the samples provided by Amazon.com, I thought I was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the Last Poets: some great politically charged poetry, perhaps accompanied by some funky beats.  However, when I listened to the whole CD, I was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like "Get Out of the Ghetto Blues."  If more of the tracks had the sound of the title track, this would be a five-star album, in my opinion.  True, Scott-Heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album, but not in the form I had hoped for.  I would take the Last Poets' album "This Is Madness" over this particular Scott-Heron album	0

230239	I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over	0
B0006VR1EQ:a_smooth_writer_and_a_great_pen!:linda	I use fountain pens everyday, so I know what I am talking about: This is a great fountain pen for everyday writing -- one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price (unlike the average (non limited edition) fountain pens, which can cost over $100 -- and sometimes much more). The Pilot Varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink, and the nib (IE: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. Fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either!	1

437228	People magazine is one of the worst expressions of American life.  Instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - People encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images, people we will never meet, and in many cases people who have very little going for them. Does anyone really think that Britney Spears has anything to say about anything, or that Paris Hilton is barely  aware of her own existence?  Does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times J.Lo is engaged (in order to get on the cover of another magazine) or who Demi Moore is grinding with today or where Gweyneth gets her gowns	0

0767003357:this_is_the_one_!!:james_w._baker	This has got to be the BEST adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen. And Samantha Morton is the reason. She is positively delightful in the title role. She has grace and beauty just perfect for the roll. One of her lines of dialogue is incorrect. She says "I am not a beauty, I am Jane Eyre". Truthfully speaking, she IS a beauty! The story flows smoothly. It's not too long nor too short. My favorite used to be the Orson Wells, Joan Fontaine version. But after seeing this British version, I had to change. You will not go wrong buying it	1

The filter doesn't "lock" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher.  It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth.  The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this.	0
0399900438:ludlum's_best:b._sloane_"dotalbon"	If you love Ludlum's over-the-top novels (and I do), The Matarese Circle has to be up there with the best. Not all of Ludlum's books are a good match of plot and style -- the repeated &quot;Oh my God!&quot; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on aren't as riveting as they could be (the two Bourne sequels suffer from this problem, I think.) But Circle delivers on all fronts. Part One is a masterpiece all by itself -- the intricate cat-and-mouse game between Talienkov and Scofield plays out thrillingly. And these are two of Ludlum's most believably drawn characters; we feel empathy for both, and root for them to join forces from the get-go. Antonia Gravet, the inevitable gorgeous heroine/love interest who surfaces in Part Two, brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot. One final bonus: some of Ludlum's zestiest minor characters appear in this book, adding to the fun in nearly every chapter.	1

B0009FUAR4:ge_75325_spacemaker_am/fm_radio_/_cd_player:b._zerkle	Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE & RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect.	1

B000EALK8W:i_wish_i_had_read_the_reviews:k._gillies_"kateling"	After my Nextel phone started acting up, I decided to switch services because I liked the Razr style and a lot of people I was calling were already on Verizon so the "In" calling was a bonus. I have had this phone all of 3 days and already miss my Motorola i860. You can import only a couple of MP3s before the phones memory is full, unless you buy their $50 transflash card (1 gig is the largest). Then, you cannot assign the MP3s you import as ringtones either, a major disappointment for me - again missing my i860 with its 400+ ringtones that I imported from random WAV, midi and MP3 files. You cannot change the softkeys on the main menu either and the calendar is hard to input events (you have to set a reminder for all, there is no option for no reminder). All in all, not what I grew accustomed to with my i860.  I'm already thinking the $175 early term charge is a bargain compared to what I will spend over the life of my 2-year contract. And that leads me to another rip-off with Verizon, they charge you an extra $35 to sign only a one-year term! Next time I'll read the fine print, and just upgrade my Nextel	0

56790	Ethan Mordden's editors have allowed him to ruin what could possibly have been a good book.  This is the worst of his books on the various decades of the Broadway musical as the faults of the seventies book have widened into gulfs.  His political ramblings (often just slightly right of Ann Coulter and making as much sense) seep through the book, dragging it down.  The French people are slammed a number of times, along with the ACLU, Burt Lancaster (apparently, according to Ethan a good friend of Stalin) and the left in general, while the author defends Bush (and it does take some looking back over the page to figure out how he fits all this into a book on musical theatre).  The author's train of thought wanders like a bitter old man  all over the page in search of a target, any target.  It is often hard to stomach.  The truly sad fact about this is that the author often has quite cogent things to say about a particular musical and when he does stick to that, it can actually make one want to look at the work again.  An editor should have cleaned the work up before before allowing it on stage to greet its public.  The author is capable of better work	0

I've worn out 3 Norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase I thought.  This razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it.  I have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart, but it continues to do it at least 4 times each shave, and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face.

As her outfit might suggest, looks like Miss Muffet as a bit of a fetish going on, need I say S&M, and with that said, being pinned (blindly I might add) by this monsterous spider may be more of a turn on then you might think.  You'd expect to see Miss Muffet in a frilly dress and bonnet maybe, blue dress to be exact but with her lether bondage in black and pink this 'Twisted' point of view proves to be anything but expected.

There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo	0

B00004RFQG:nothing_beats_a_bunn--_period!!!:"pd2k"	When I was looking to purchase a new machine, I only was looking for a Bunn. Bunn makes the best coffee machines, none can compare.

If you're a serious coffee drinker, please don't cheap out on a Mr.Coffee, Braun or Krupps-- frankly they cannot brew coffee at the speed, temperature, or taste of a Bunn unit. I bought the A10 to replace a Bunn unit that I used for 10 years without a glitch	1

555080	I thought that this would be toy my daughter would grow into and not be excited about at first.  This was the first toy she opened at Christmas at only 19 months and was not interested in any others for the rest of the week!  She enjoyed collecting the fingers and and "counting" them.  She also has grown in the last few months to putting the puzzle together herself although the fingers might not make it on the correct hand just yet. Very durable, love that it is a traditional wood toy that doesn't have flashing lights or needs batteries! She still loves it months later.  The only downside to any toy like this, is we have to collect the pieces after she has put them in various places around the house.	1

B0000644EE:great_coffee_/_good_pot:k._a._roso_"percolator_snob"	I've had this pot for over a year and love it. Fast, hot, great tasting coffee which stays hot and fresh for a long time. I bought it after my last electric perk had died at age 10 years because I loved the looks of it, and there were limited choices at the brick-and-mortars.  I read all the reviews only after I bought it. The reviewers' major complaint is about the plastic knob cracking. Yes, the plastic knob is poorly-designed and is the only reason I give this pot 4 stars instead of 5. The designer should have known that users would take the lid off the pot by using the knob. However, it is completely possible to remove the lid without touching the knob at all. Just pop the lid by pushing in and up near where the lid meets the pot. This is what I've been doing since I bought the pot and I've had absolutely no problems with the knob. It's unlikely you'll need to remove the lid while the coffee is still hot, so you can avoid burned fingertips. A secondary complaint is about grounds in the coffee. I've never had this problem; I suspect users who have are either not careful when spooning the coffee into the basket, or they are using the wrong grind. It's important with any percolator to use a percolator grind, or  "FAC" 'for all coffeemakers' grind.	1

I had one coworker once, who would walk by me just so he could smell it. He told me what he was doing, of course, he just loved the smell. People want to know what I am wearing and where they can purchase it. I feel great when I'm wearing it and, I will keep using it as long as they will make it	1
0780606736:pretty_to_look_at_but...:sean_taboloff_"hound_of_desire"	I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.

The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!!	0
B0002T1G3E:short_lived:kimberjs	Until a week ago, I'd have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew-strength control.  Last week, though, the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned. The shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when I went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee, I discovered the unit was still on.  Draining the pot, I attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on. I finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again. After unplugging it, the unit went into the trash. I strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit. Obviously, it is a fatal design flaw--or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers. In all, it lasted about eight months	0
B000CFJ446:great_seat_cover_!!:john_mcleod	This is a much nicer seat cover than I imagined it would be (especially for the cost).  The only complaint I have is that with it in place, I can't extend my head rest (I'm tall), but other than that, it's very comfortable, and protects the car seat under it very well.  I wear suspenders, and without something to protect the seat, the car seat gets cut by the buckles	1
B0006FHB6A:not_well_thought_out:avid_shopper	I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.	0
294528	I had to read this book for a political theory class in college.  After talking with several other members I was happy to find out that I do not have the reading skills of a third grader...Benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with.  The book is also not organized well.  In order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes.  Points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book.  Benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued.  Throughout much of the book Benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of John Rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights.  To be honest, I disagree with her views and admit that I might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if I agreed with her.  Still, I do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically.  Much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.	0

B000EPFCC2:not_good_enough_by_itself.:bradford_l._gough	I do not think suction cup mounts work very well.  This one is no exception.  While attaching and detaching my Garmin Nuvii is easy enough, the cup does not support the weight.  I was disappointed that a Friction bag was not available for my Nuvii.  However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself	0

B000BN7W9S:nice_seat:c._anderson_"momof2"	I bought this seat a couple weeks ago and my 2 month old nephew is using it when I have him until my son is born in June. I love the look, style and safety of this seat. The only thing that I thought may be a problem was the way the shoulder straps adjust height. My nephew is 22" and he is almost on the second to last adjustment. Also the side impacts don't leave alot of room for a head positioner for newborns and they are far enough apart for the head to have room to wobble side to side. My nephew seems to love it though and seems really comfortable in it. The upright position is something I like, I have never seen him sweat in it, he seems to have growing room, the canopy covers him fine, and I think it is the most comfortable to carry. His parents are using an Eddie Bauer and I know alot of people (including me in the past) that use Graco and other brands and they seem roomier, but not as safe. Also I haven't seen a baby over 4-5 months in the infant seats anyways, I don't know anyone that would want to lug around a baby over 15 pounds in an infant seat, I guess that's just the few of us who aren't body builders. My nephew is 11 pounds now and he is getting pretty heavy in the seat, it's a good thing that the seat isn't too heavy itself. I would recommend this seat, but I can't explain the other reviews, so mabey trying it out in the store is best for everyone	1

B000JZOCZA:good_times!:andrew_rosett_"realize_your_dreams"	Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it	1
B000BWFWGO:best_valentine's_day_present_ever:d._wells	I gave my boyfriend the most romantic presents ever for Valentine's Day, but this is still the one he talks about the most. He loved having all the seasons and this was the best price I found anywhere.	1
B0000BYA0U:teeny_tiny!:ariane_stanley_"jack_of_all_products"	This locket was dime-sized--much smaller than I had anticipated.  It was also very plain and looked cheap.  The mother-of-pearl locket was MUCH BETTER	0
B00081NENQ:i_regret:josefina_m._pourier	I was looking forward to get the massager, which I was for a while searching. But I regret to inform you that I could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes. After the it didn't work. (the light on the adapter do not work) I'm glad that I can express this.	0
321001	Photoshop is incredibly awesome!!!  And in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program, it is a must have for them. However the learning curve here is extremely steep.  This program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale.  There are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including Photoshop elements.	1
B00008SJXQ:microwave_is_great,_toaster_is_better!:m._abbett_"retro_pagan"	This is by far the best toaster we've ever owned. It does not have the thin metal elements that glow red like a conventional, so I don't know how it works yet, but it gets the toast perfectly brown on each side. A fan comes on and stays on to cool it down during and for a brief period after operation. The bagels we toasted in it were just perfect!	1
B000002KDT:best_album_by_alice_cooper:surfing_guitarist_"stu"	Studio album released in 1971, by the original band-a real band with Alice Cooper, Neal Smith, Dennis Dunaway, Michael Bruce, and Glen Buxton. I think the other band members (apart from Cooper), got the short end of the stick. This album, along with these 'Love it to death', 'Billion dollar babies', and 'Love it to death' are so vastly superior to 'his' other albums. The band plays and writes really well together as a 'real' band. Case in point, listen to 'Dada' from a few years later-dreadful! Just wish he had kept a proper band together, even if he fealt that they were not as musically good as some of the late session musicians. Rock is about feel, more than technique in my opinion. I can't even listen to 'Dada' or	1
B0002I65X6:product_apparently_doesn't_exist:s._goodson_"online_shopper"	Be Aware Before you Order! On Oct. 31, 2006 I ordered two cases of bottles through Amazon, to be delivered from Stacks and Stacks. When they arrived, the cases were only 16 count instead of 48 count. I called Stacks and Stacks and a supervisor was to return my call, I received an email instead (supervisor claimed my home number was a fax). She offered to credit me shipping cost ($18.47 for the heavier weight boxes - the 16 count boxes are only 5.99 to ship)if I wanted to keep the boxes, otherwise they would arrange to pick them up. She claimed that J.K. Adams does not make a 48 ct case. I responded that I wished to return the boxes (I had less than half of the bottles I needed, and the cost per bottle was now more than doubled). I have since written two more times and as of 11/16/06 have received no response, no instructions to return, and no credit to my account. I have filed a claim with Amazon A-Z Guarantee, hopefully this will be resolved soon	0
B0006TOS8A:excellent_case_for_dscm1:vincent_liu_"vincentliu007"	With most of the carrying case made of either fake leather or some kind of neoprene material, this one is really different.  The rigid structure also seem to do a great job to protect the camera.  There is also a belt loop and D-ring feature which is great.	1
B0007Z2JMA:it_works!:mommy_of_2_hula_girls!!	Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park -fantastic!  Easy to put on - easy to store!  I don't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway!   But this did it's duty	1
153228	BIG fan of 80's... music and culture, and most of all The Movies.  she's having a baby is not just a teen movie like "sweet sixteen" or "breakfast club".  Its somewhat a true newly wed story with many funny moments wishing your marriage will be like that some day.  Soundtrac is great with kate bush "the woman's work".  My girlfriend cried and as i hand her the tisue when this song played.  i told her i'll feel the same if she were the wife.  boy i got lovin that nite... i would watch over and over again and the last credit when 80's famous star show their contribution suggesting the name for the baby, i thought it was clever.	1
B000ACHVVE:awesome_and_unobtrusive:s._j._starr	This was my first GPS system of any kind.  I wasn't sure what to expect.  I have a small Mazda Miata so I wanted a small-screen GPS that did not overwhelm my small dashboard and this did not disappoint.  I was afraid that the screen would be too small, but it's perfect.  I don't think a bigger screen would do anything more than take up more space.	1
B000A1FFRC:roomy_toaster_oven:k._kigduh	Why would you get a smaller toaster oven when you can get this one at such a good price?  It works well, looks good and you can actually fit things in it.  Never be frustrated by what you can't fit in your toaster oven!	1

198018	I have been looking for a copy of this movie for a long time now because I wanted my kids to see it. I was very young when I first watched this film and it stuck to my mind somehow. Good thing amazon had it and they do make shipments to my country here in Asia.	0
B0000658CG:not_worth_the_money:	I got this for christmas 2004.  Played 5 DVD's on it and started to get the &quot;No Disk&quot; reading.  I only had it for 1 month.  I sent it back and they are replacing it since it is under warranty but they are replacing it with a different model.  We will see if it has the same problems.  According to reviews of the 1700m model I expect the same.  I suggest you spend a little more money and get a better DVD Player	0
245053	Sports Illustrated is a great magazine, the premier magazine for sports. The writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article. To make this short, I highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it's a great gift for a husband, boyfriend, or just any sports fan	1
458751	I just bought this cd because I am learning Haitian creole, and that's one of the languages that is supposed to be on this cd. When I installed it, I was unable to find anything on the CD in Haitian creole, even though it is listed as one of the languages on the case. So it has been a complete waste of money for me, perhaps if I was interested in the other languages I could give it more stars.	0

B0001IM97I:miserable_acting,_horrible_script,_inane_directing.:d._mok	What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.	0
B000066T1G:good_magazine_but_...:new_mexican_mom	I have had the subscription for 2.5 years now and I enjoy getting it bimonthly. The recipes often do call for hard to find ingrediants (since I don't live in a real big city) and most of them take alot of prep time and cooking but that's why the magazine is COOKING PLEASURES. It's not Quick 'N Easy.	1
B000FH9ONC:fisherman's_friend:alex	This is a great battery charger that you need if you have a boat and trolling motor.  High quality and easy to use	1

B00008RV0B:rent_it_first!!:jsranchmn_"susan"	A dismal disappointment. I think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy. When I see the high ratings, I wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product. The original Lonesome Dove mini series was unbelievably well done. A complete multifaceted joy. I was so excited when I saw there was a sequel and the joy of Lonesome Dove would continue. Well it didn't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings	0

B000056CGX:an_uncle_who_bought_a_cool_gift:	I bought the Harry Potter Magic Puzzles for my nieces and I scored some major brownie points.  They loved this at first because it was about their hero, Harry Potter, however, they play with it for hours on end.  Putting the puzzles together is fun in itself, but then there are the cool magic tricks and the VERY COOL optical illusion using the spiral disk too.  This is great for any kid interested in magic, as well jigsaw puzzles and Harry!  A big thumbs up	1

439809	Quite simply, it's great, though a bit on the challenging side.  Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title, and one that, despite it's 'rated 'E' for everyone' approach, will appeal to adults as well as kids.  It's not without some light frustration, but the good far outweighs the bad.	1
5096	I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left.	0
B00004TWLZ:i_love_this_film:sally_ann_simmons_"captainl4"	This film has great color production and performance.  The price is also just right.  You can't go wrong with the Fujifilm Superia X-TRA 400	1
B000I1A71I:great_for_the_size_it_is,_but_not_meeting_my_needs...:joan_matts_"mauntie"	This is a great "little" lunch box and I stress the word LITTLE. The way the bag is made if you put a medium or large bowl in it, when you carry it by the handle, you are carrying the bowl on it's side, which is ok if you are sure you secured the lids, but then when you go around the corner fast and it falls off the seat you start to wonder, did i really close the lid on the bowl right? sorry, i got of track there. Anyway, I use this daily and it does keep things cold and has two outer pockets that are great for utensils, napkins, gum and small things. Also, I have been using for over 3 months and it is quite durable.	1
B000B8L1U4:bike_:chester_l._botkins_"cybervet65"	It's ok. The bike is packaged well and is easily put together if one does not use the instructions.	1

B000GHV6M8:quicken_2007_basic:sara_e._sohns	For a basic money management software, this product met my expectations.  No frills but very easy to use.  Convenient calendar of payments and scheduled payments showing my balance after each transaction.  I set my account up in 20 minutes.  There isn't a manual but for the price and ease of use, I don't need one	1
B000GANTLQ:the_perfect_balance:christine_karaki	this cologne is the perfect balance of wood and sweetness. It is not overpowering, and it is very masculine. I bought it for my boyfriend, and found that on him it's even more potent! It's aa great fragranc	1
179570	Apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back.

463377	Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies.	1
B000AL8FHY:business_as_usual::.	You've got a lot of ab-rollers. You need a gimmick: The product is  no better than the competition. You don't have an ad budget. What do you do?  CHARGE FOUR TIMES AS MUCH. Then just sit and wait for the 'clients' who are looking for a 'quality' product to assume that the high price actually means something	0
436382	Wow!  This is the best thing I received for my baby.  It has saved me sooo much time.  I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this.  I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit.  We just never use them.  I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller.  She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy.  When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller.  It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination.  She never felt the cold!	1
572718	This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out.	0
B00021D10S:bless_this_product!_relief_finally!!:g._bhatty_"manni's_mommy"	This product is great!

It's quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next ;)The accessories are cute, but she'd rather use stuff from Mommy's purse. ;) The purse is oh so cute too, and durable. My daughter is 21 months old, she received this on Christmas and has been a favorite since.	1
B000BPCWEQ:no_support_for_bad_lcd_screen:laurel_j._kaeferlein_"3_kids'_mommy"	I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill.	0

140433	While I did not have to spend retail on this headset(I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay), I did have to buy the communicator(which can be found on gamestop.com) and it was still worth the money.  It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you.  While it is not worth $50, if you can get it as part of a deal with something else, by all means do it.	1
B00007KN3A:wake_awakens_the_soul_and_spirit:barbara_russo	Ethereal, rhythmic, haunting, eclectic.  Wake: Best of Dead Can Dance is a collection of songs that will move your soul and spirit.

Each time you hear it will lead to new discoveries and emotions.	1

B000E4ALHY:our_new_favorite_breakfast_food...:czaday	These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever	1
B0002OD3JY:flash_stopped_working:mary_"mom_of_2"	I bought this almost exactly 2 years ago, and I turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash, and the flash would not work. It was set to automatic flash.  Using the auto setting, I thought there used to be 3 flash settings (auto, forced flash and no flash), but now there were only 2.  I took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash, and the flash went off outside!  Something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused.	0
B000ELSZBQ:never_used_product:sarah_n_"ryjussarah"	I'm sure this item would have received a 5 star rating if I had used it; I have found Samsung products to be very good.  I did not use this item because of the additional charge it would have added to my XM Satellite Radio Subscription.  I already am paying costs for two radios.  I purchased this item to have more portable capabilities, but I did not want to incur an additional charge on my XM account.  Consequently, I returned the product without using it	0

B00020Y3YM:high_quality_spatula:s._knavel	I recently purchased a Weber Gold Series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill. I decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the Weber name and I was not disappointed.  The spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort.  The length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish.  I would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their Weber grill!	1

B00005BPK5:a_lifesaver_for_us,_but_one_strong_reservation...:marie_stone	First, I must say that this sling was an absolute LIFESAVER when my (somewhat colicky) son was a newborn.  No matter how fretful his mewling, when we swaddled him and placed him in this sling, he would fall asleep. Because he otherwise rarely slept in those early weeks, he spent a good deal of time in it.  Three aspects of the design are great: 1. The bottom is padded so you can lay baby on a hard surface and use sling as a changing pad; 2. The sides are high and have drawstrings that allow the sling to be opened up almost flat; 3. It grows with your baby--my tiny baby hated the front-type Bjorn carriers, but loved this and still likes it.  One aspect of the design is, to me, dreadful--the shoulder strap! It should be wider and padded.  I tried repositioning it every which way and no matter what I did, the strap dug into my shoulder.  In the end I just put a thick mitten under the strap on my shoulder.  Good use for a mitten that's lost it's mate, but I would rather have a better strap	1

B0009S4US6:great_toybox:kerry_dorr-stasierowski	I looked everywhere for a plastic durable toybox, seems so simple but unfortunately no one kept anything in stock to look at in person. I took a chance on this one because the price was right, and I'm very pleased. I like the pockets on the front, my son loves putting his books in & out. If I would change one thing it is the lid. It is lightweight as to not hurt little hands & fingers (which is good), but is never locked onto the toybox, it lifts off very easily, so sometimes just bumping it causes it to fall out of the shallow indentations it sits in. Other than that we love it	1

B000EI2NV2:the_position_of_the_child_wasn't_straight,_it_was_almost_tip_over_:angel_jimenez	I rated 2 stars because the joint from the kid's bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike.  I also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child's bike straight, but I never recived the part.  I am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn't help me. I hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs.	0
590494	one word.  generic.  terrible.  boring. (well, they are all one word)  people must learn to have a better taste in music.  granted there is at least one good song.  a few others are decent, but only because there are no vocals.  if you have heard any new band for the last 3 years, you have heard pulse ultra.  my friend likes breaking binjaman (another uber generic rock band in my book) and he listened to 2 songs from pulse ultra and said "thats enough".  do yourself a favor and buy a GOOD cd.  when will people learn!	0
B00024GSZA:worst_and_most_frustrating_toy_ever_purchased:k._zahorik_"five"	Bought this and several other Minimates for by son's birthday.  As we are huge Lego fans, I thought this would be a great compliment.  The "lego-like" bricks are ill fitted, either constantly coming undone or never being able to fit together at all.  This caused great frustration and unhappiness.  We finally had to hide the entire lot from my son too keep him from breaking down everytime he or another family member tried to put the Batcave or any of the vehicles together.  Do not buy.  I would like a full refund and an apology from Amazon for carrying such an afwul quaility toy, and from the creator of the Minimates. Ugh	0

B000B1ESE2:great_for_people_who_sleep_on_their_backs:joseph_lertola	This clock is great for people who sleep on their backs. If you happen to be lying on your stomach though, you have to turn over to see the time on the ceiling or reach over to the clock and press the snooze button to briefly turn on the clock light. I wish the clock itself had a lighted time display. Also we have 11 foot ceilings so the display is a little dim.	1
B0001A99ME:p.o.s.:caesalpina_"casealpina"	I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman	0

B000BDEZ2A:give_it_a_pass:jj	I bought this watch from REI.  The first one's electronics gave it up on the first night when I connected it to the PC.  On the second two the plastic housing started separating.  That's right, I had to return the watch THREE TIMES, the 3rd time I just wanted my money back.	0
422344	I find the Woman's Day magazine a helpful source of information for myself, my family and my friends.  As I go through the articles and information in the magazine, I note items of interest for my husband and I (we are retired seniors), and for my daughter who has two children.  Since the news that my son and his wife are expecting, I also save information for them.  I have tried some of the recipes and were very pleased.  Thank you for putting out such a great magazine	1
B0009HXZ10:cute_but_dangerous:david	We purchased this for our 3 year old daughter who loves the Disney princesses.  Even though we purchased it as a "play" bed we soon realized the poor design with the unsecured sides could be a hazard for any child.  We immediately returned the item and warned the store clerk on how dangerous the bed could be.   It's not worth the risk of suffocation for an air bed that probably wouldn't last long anyway.  I recommend you look else where for your child's princess dreams	0
6300248135:great_film,_excellent_dvd:andrew_jon_abrahamson	The Fly is fantastic and well worth a watch.  Goldblum's performance is also just outstanding.  For a really cool, creepy, interesting and engaging film, this is the one.	1

B00004YRTK:uncomfortable_for_child_and_adult:b._whiting_"frustrated_shopper"	I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop	0

B0002A6VU6:do_not_order_from_andrew_christian:j._huber	We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.  They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $26.23.  They insisted that it was not defective.  I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.	0

B00000269D:big_band_jazz:_loud,_fervent,_it's_a_last_hurrah...:william_e._adams	Basie's best players come to Duke's place, the Columbia Records 30th Street Studios in 1961 and face Ellington's finest. Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says "The Count Meets the Duke" but in larger letters it declares "FIRST TIME!" and then adds "2 Great Orchestras" and finally states "Duke Ellington and Count Basie." The label Columbia/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says "Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here	1
B0009T8CFM:deception:roger_j._melson	We were very disappointed, upon opening the package, to see how small the glasses are.  I was concerned about this when I purchased them, but could find no info on size (and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are (2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1/4 inches tall; I can hide the entire glass in my closed fist)	0

This is where the book fails terribly.  None of the audio samples will compile and the information about OpenAL is just plain wrong.

6301965787:one_of_the_greatest_silent_films:nom-de-nick_"nom-de-nick"	At the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope, and has held up remarkably well, despite a few touches of typical silent overacting/heavy-handedness. Still, the 1925 Hur belongs in any collector's collection for its importance in film history. Not to mention the fact that it sealed MGM's financial future. So of course, as of this writing, the greedy oinkers at the studios haven't released it on DVD because it won't sell 4 million copies	1

The texture, consistency and effectiveness of the cream are first rate - and you don't need a badger hair brush! I initially missed using a brush at first, but don't miss all the product I wasted that were left behind in the bristles.  Couple proraso with a good safety razor (may I suggest Merkur) and you'll get a shave that trounces anything a Mach III can throw at you. Trust me	1

1295	If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine.

B000056HNU:it_leaks!:a._pallaci	I used this when I became too sore to use my electric pump.  The milk seeps under the pump guard and it leaks out from the edges onto clothes. I wouldn't even say getting this as a pump for when you're on the go is a good idea because the leaking milk will get all over leaving you with clean up. I had to buy a replacement part because the bottom part that screws on the base of the pump cracked from sterilizing (which it says you can do).   They don't sell just that one little piece so I had to buy the actual pump again as a part.  It cost nearly $30 to order this part and it took over 2 weeks to receive it.  The entire system just isn't durable or made for much use.  Also, cleaning down into the bend of this pump thoroughly is practically impossible.	0
B00012WUE6:a_little_dated,_but_works_well_for_kids_and_adults.:concerned_one_"thrashfan"	Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.  Kids don't notice, and neither do most adults.  Worth picking up, great price	1

B0009JOTAE:not_for_little_boys!:s._cross	I hate, hate, hate this potty!  The shield will not stay on.  My son sits on the potty and either the shield falls off into the potty or he grabs it and hands it to me saying "here you go".  It is also cumbersome to get the bowl out of the potty to empty.  There is a lot of open space under the seat that gives bacteria a great chance to grow even with frequent cleaning.  Maybe this would work for a little girl but it is a no-go for a little boy	0
531150	I agree with others who said it crashes the system. Overall, I found SS6 Pro had more problems than it was worth--even if it were free, it's not worth all the time and effort. Besides all the crashes, downloading the virus/spyware updates via dialup TAKES FOREVER! Each download runs 1 to 1 1/2 hours. BE FOREWARNED.	0
444618	When my boyfriend bought this for me I was so happy and I remember I would play this music and sing for him in the car on cool dark, starry nights and I would be mesmerized not only by the intensity of those nights, but by the music she sang and how she deeply, richly portrayed those songs. She really knew how to set the mood for any lover or lonely lover as well. I totally recommend this CD to start if you have not heard much of her music...SHe truly is addicting once you hear these songs...These songs will definetly put you in an enchanting and romantic journey	1

They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out.	1

This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both.	1
B0002F5JBS:teaching_music_to_youngsters:joanna_daneman	Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like triangles, sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing.	1

It was either these products or emptying all the furniture out of her room, putting a mattress on the floor, and putting a lock on her door at night to keep her safe.  Life saver	1
B000HQJPP8:really_tasty!:l._mountford	I was a little surprised.  I'm not a huge fan of packaged rice or noodle dishes, but sometimes I need to throw together something quickly.  I was intrigued by the list of ingredients, and decided to give Fox River Rice Creole a try.  I'm glad I did!  This is seriously good stuff -- lots of flavor, easy to prepare, etc.  Best of all, it's not overly salty, one of my pet peeves with packaged food.  It's great as a side dish, but I think it would also be wonderful with a little dded sausage (maybe some andouille).  I'll definitely be purchasing this again	1

I was figuring on getting an arm unit, but when I got this wrist unit I wanted to see how it would work.  The whole system is very easy to use and fast.  You need to be sitting and resting to take the reading, but is happens quickly and then it stores all the results for you.  I didn't think I would really use the memory function but it has come in pretty handy.  I can say this was a great gift, something I use a lot, and something that will help me stay healthy	1

B000KPWC1K:great_watch!:david_b.	I received this watch yesterday and would like to counter some comments in other reviews. The watch I received has no scratches on the crystal. It was packaged nicely. It does not seem too thick. It does not appear cheap or lightweight. Although the back plate and two buttons are plastic, the rest of the watch is sturdy metal, and it feels solid. The wristband is just the right size for me, although I do have a gorilla wrist. I didn't find the manual difficult to understand. The watch attempted to auto-sync overnight, but didn't get a signal, so I manually sync'ed it the next day according to the instructions with no problem. Easy-to-read dial, low price (about $35), overall a great atomic watch worth twice what I paid	1

B000E9TBR0:_not_the_instant_snow_i_was_expecting!:randall_e._bright	Quick shipping on product but the product was not what I was hoping for.  The "snow" was much grainer than I had expected.  I had seen what I thought was the same item in stores during the holiday season and that "instant snow" was very fine and really looked like snow.  This product doesn't look much like snow and doesn't have the same texture	0
B0007CXT72:don't_buy_it!:ahightower_"annie"	Totally not worth it! I was shocked to see spiders crawling across the stupid thing more than once!  It doesn't work. I've had it for several months and I am still seeing bugs all over the place.	0
B0006G2LBY:best_fountain_pen_for_the_money:r._ward_"pen_fanatic"	The Waterman Phileas fountain pen is a wonder. Smooth writing, well built, nice weight and balance, it's a heck of a pen for the price (always $40 or less if you shop around).	1
B0001J3Z2U:not_exactly_as_pictured:john_delano	Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps	0
462199	Book contains many useful lists / charts / comparisons to define giftedness.  Many helpful hints about raising a gifted child.  Main criticism is that the book is more about raising children in general -- and  may push those with &quot;normal&quot; kids into thinking they have gifted  ones and down that track -- when they should not. Gifted kids are the  exception, not the norm as this book makes it seem	0
B000JOOG1Q:terrific_booster!:barbara_stephen-macri_"yakgoddess"	This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can't believe we didn't buy it sooner.  It's easy to clean and doesn't slide off the chair.  Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy.  It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips.  Great vendor with quick delivery too	1

B0000UXOHG:undersized_and_overpriced:jane_bailey	This was a TERRIBLE purchase on my part.  It doesn't even deserve 1 star.  I just wanted a small bag to wear over the shoulder for quick access to my z7590 without holding other equipment or being too bulky.  The bag was too small for my z7590, and I paid $8 shipping PLUS return shipping.  I only hope they don't charge me a re-stocking fee. I went to WalMart, found a cute little bag in the electronics dept. that the camera fits great in, with room for the strap AND extra memory cards or battery if necessary.  They have cute ones for ladies too, with pink polka dots or stripes inside!  For only $12.  Next time, I'll be smarter!	0
B000GJJF24:warning_incomplete_episode!!!:r._mccoy_"r._mccoy"	The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them	0
B00005LVUX:buy_yourself_the_seasoned_one_if_you_never_owned_cast_iron.:bc_"bc"	Having bought the no name preseasoned cast iron pans vs this need to be seasoned cast iron pan, as the tittle says:  Pay the 3-4 dollar difference and get it preseasoned instead.

85662	After the incredible "Monkey Island" series was halted, I feared that I would never find another series of games that had such imaginative storylines, entertaining dialogue, and lush scenery. Then "Bully" came along, and I was hooked. This really is a great game, and you shouldn't be set against it because it's really nothing at all like Grand Theft Auto. There's no blood, no sexuality (except for kissing), and there's so many involving and engrossing storylines. The characters are also some of the best I've ever seen, each having their own stories and personality. The whole clique thing also reminds you of your days in high school. GET BULLY-- IT'S AN AWESOME GAME. People who like this game should also look at the "Monkey Island" series of games for PC and PS2, and the "Nancy Drew" series for PC	1

179568	The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable, at least for me.  It's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear, and forget about jogging wearing this.  Also the insert comes off very easily, and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears, you need to find the other sizes of the insert.  Sound quality is mediocre, as callees often complain about wind noise from my end.  I'm not happy with these	0

B000FVNXY4:unhappy_buyer:molly_"molly"	I have always used foam rubber as a topper over our mattress but changed to this Memory Foam.  After using it for one month, I have taken it off the bed and it is back in the box it was shipped in.  I DO NOT like the Memory Foam at all.  It seems to be great when you first lie down on it and then after a hour or two my body just sinks down until it is against the mattress below it and I am not that heavy a person, 160 lbs. It is so hard to find foam rubber but I will search until I find it and never by Memory Foam again!  Doubt I can get my money back.  Have not talked to the Seller about it	0

B00007AZAC:the_best_out_there:makeup_maven	Agree with the other reviewer, nothing like this in the states. No country kitch, no traditional, just straight modern, clean, pretty rooms/homes. It's expensive, that's the part that stinks. I buy it at $7.50 an issue, but it's worth it. B/c it's modern, there is a lot of minimalism, which you very rarely see in U.S. magazines. I keep every copy of this. They are always good for reference, i read them each dozens of times over.	1
B000FW7UJM:beautiful_but_faulty_clasp:d._holyoak	I love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective.  I contacted Sabrina, and they were great about sending me a new one ASAP, with a label for returning the other one.  That was impressive, and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued.  Still, the clasp is a product defect, and I'm sure one of these days I will probably loose the bracelet b/c it comes undone unknowingly	1
B000KUEYHA:a_star_is_born:lynn_olzacki	I bought this for my 2 year old grandson, and he loves it.  His mommy plays the guitar and he always wanted hers.

B00004VXB9:a_very_good_hand_blender:william_hagquist_"billh"	We bought this hand blender to get rid of the problems created by the power cord on our Braun corded hand blender.  The Cuisinart took care of the problem.	1
B000IOMXN0:hoping_for_the_magic_of_the_first_album;_got_the_mediocrity_of_the_second:jason_silver_"jason_maryland"	Outside of 'Curious' sung by Tina Cousins, this album is a dud -- at least by 'Believe' standards. Most songs sound similar with the same beat. The album won't make your ears bleed, but the band should have quit calling itself '4 Strings' after the departure of Vanessa. It is a very different band now, and should not tease 'Believe' fans into thinking another 4 Strings album of simliar quality and vocals is being released. I would buy 'Curious' if it can be purchased separately, but would skip buying this album. If a future reviewer knows where Vanessa ended up, please let me know. The mixers of the group are talented, but Vanessa was the real star	0
B0005Z8GGK:stella_d'oro_roman_egg_biscuits_-_february_2006:philip_j_kaufman	This is a superb product that used to be found on most grocery store shelves.  Sadly, they disappeared from the shelves.  After an extensive internet search for the product, I was able to find them through Amazon.com and Gristede's Supermarket.  I ordered a case and they arrived in perfect shape and just as advertised.  When these are gone, I will certainly use this same procedure to order more	1

B000ID1AR6:school_bus_review:constance_brand	This school bus was smaller than I expected, about 4 inches long. I bought it for my 3 year old son who loves school buses. He broke it in the first 5 minutes of opening the package. It's a pull-back and go car. And he pulled it back too far on the first try and it snapped the wheels. They were wobbly from then on. This toy is not for kids and it's not really for playing with from what I can tell. Very dissappointed	0
B000F2M0C4:buyer_beware!__make_sure_you_have_seen_this_unit_in_person_before_you_purchase_it_and_this_is_really_what_you_want!:m._winschel	Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal	0
B0002FHENE:looks_good,_functions_as_it_should!!_:angela_m._woo	I got mine for about 1 week ago to match with my MBP (silver theme). Someone mentioned about the light indications not showing as they should, or in the wrong way but mine works fine.	1
B00000K135:brother_m231_labeling_tape-1/2_inch_width:skip_johnson	This stuff is great.  My wife and I use it to label things we don't use often so we can tell at a glance what is in a box or what a bottle contains.  It goes into the labeler without a fuss and works the first time every time.  The glue on the back (once the backing is peeled) requires the the surface be dirt and oil free or it will eventually come off.  The printing will "wear off" if you are using it in a high friction environment such as on a book in a backpack.  However, it lasts long enough that whatever it is on becomes habit and the label is no longer necessary.	0

6303355102:worthless,_except_for_tarantino's_cameo:a._o._sheepfielder	"Sleep with Me" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of "Top Gun."  That lasts about two minutes.  The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's "Top Gun" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here	0
B0000BZEY4:don't_waste_your_birthday_money:	This looks better on TV than it actually works.  The cable that the ball is connected to is very rigid and you have to really hit the ball hard to get it to wrap around.  When it unwinds it does so VERY slow and loses it's momentum and sinks to the pole before you even get a chance to hit it.  Plus they advise you not to use an aluminum or wood bat to hit it with?  What are you supposed to hit it with then?  These things you don't find out until you get it out of the box and set it up.  Don't waste money on this item	0

B000GGD3O8:gate_with_missing_parts:richard_d._mahoney	Recieved the gate with parts missing.

B0006FHB92:a_good_buy:s._field_"pregnant_and_bored"	I was that parent who said "I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer." And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.	1
B000N5UWLY:modest_and_honest:sean_d._tyler_"seanbo0"	This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top.  Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it.	1
B00080VMHC:do_not_buy_this_item:rachel_"non_rider"	You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger.	0
533334	I just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song.  Thanks to Melania for pointing out the song title at the end.

B000M9CMC8:amazing_software:d._bannister	Abobe hits one out of the park. I find Adobe software clunky and hard to use. While I understand that the more flexibility you want the more complex the program but Photoshop and InDesign have learning curves that are steeper than Mount Everest. I expected Lightroom to be the same - an excellent program with a huge learning curve. Well it is and it isn't which it why Lightroom is such a pleasure to use. I don't know what Adobe is thinking in creating this gem of a program but the team who designed it are collective geniuses. For they have taken a complex and sometimes frustrating chore and for lack of better words made it gentle and pleasing. The program makes spending time with your photographs actually enjoyable.	1
B0000024KK:fresh_for_1995_[4_stars]:norfeest_"yes_yes_y'all"	I pretty much agree with EJ Rupert, but the good songs on this soundtrack are so strong that they make this album damn near classic all by themselves.  I gave this album 4 stars for that very reason.  Though it was never released as a single, "My Block" is one of Tupac's best songs (pre death row era is the best 'Pac in my opinion).  I don't think there's any question that every rap music fanatic recognizes Red and Meth's "How High" as an unquestionable classic (and this is the grimy version of How High....not the fluffy remix).  I still get open to that beat 11 years later.  Though it is somewhat formulaic, "Poppa Luv It" is still a dope cut from LL Cool J.  Bone Thugs N Harmony, Mary J. Blige, and  Onyx contribute "Everyday Thang", "Everday It Rains", and "Live!!" which show each artist in vintage form in my humble opinion.  Also, "Sowhatyousayin'" is the ideal west coast gangsta track in my mind.  Even when you get past those great tracks, you have other bangers like "Kill Dem All" [Kali Ranks], "Glamour & Glitz" [A Tribe Called Quest], and "Still Can't Fade It" [Warren G.] that still make for a great listening experience.  Hell, even The Dove Shack blew up on the strength of "Summertime In The LBC".  And the live version of Biggie's "Me & My B*tch" is definitely different from the studio version and it's great.  There's plenty to love about this album.	1
339753	Even if you don't know much about Donny Hathaway, this collection of songs is a fun mix and it's very moving.  It includes some classics with Roberta Flack that are terrific.  I enjoy it tremendously	1
B000G600CQ:a_huge_disappointment:bubbles	Bought three different kits, small to amuse the grandkids when they visit, medium to keep handy for next needed gift occasion. and El Grande for a X-Mas gift for the kids.  The pens looked great on TV but didn't work at all when we tried to use them.  Dried out too quickly, never mixed the colors so was a very huge dollar amount for low quality markers.  Also, didn't notice small print that the El Grande kit MIGHT come in a brown cardboard box--IT DID, I bet all El Grande kits came that way.  Looked terrible!	0
B000225ZG0:this_stuff_is_amazing:k._m._doemland	I'm a sort of sweaty type, so I usually like an antiperspirant/deodorant, but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash, and it's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy. Aromarant is quick and easy to use, doesn't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it, and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge	1

My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.

B000LP7V42:good_investment!:huchickybaby_"feedback_queen"	I absolutely recommend this infant seat!  My son is almost 1 now and I am still using this seat.  It is fabulous for it's fabric options of colors and most importantly for it's roominess.  My son is on the chunky side, being an exclusively breastfed baby.  He is still quite comfortable in this seat and I love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my 4 year old into her her preschool.  The travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and I am always stopped by people saying.."what a ride!".  Well it is, quite a ride.  If you buy this car seat, it will last you for the entire FIRST YEAR of your baby's life.  Thank you Graco	1

525131	I have had nothing short of an excellent experience with this product. I have created numerous videos of my children's escapades and sporting events. I do have one warning however.

My wildest expectations were exceeded.	1
B000GK8LVE:good_sata_drive_enclosure:gotta_have_it_"amars@ix.netcom.com"	One of the few of these type of items available on the market. I bought it with great trepidation after reading all the reviews. I had received some free drives from Newegg (Seagate) and needed to house them. This was a no brainer set up. The utility found it immediately without me having to mess around with turning virus protection or firewalls off. (XP pro SP2). The firmware was one rev prior so I updated it - absolutely smooth as silk. Reformatted the drives. I chose the RAID 1 option and ext3 format. I like the fact that you can specify RAID size and the leftover is formatted as striped volume. The drive is fairly solid. The fan is not very noisy. The front slide up access door is a little kludgy. Good user interface. I was also surprised with the speed of transfer especially having chosen RAID and ext3. The only thing I can never get to work and it is 100% MY lack of knowledge is the email alerts. I couldn't get Infrant to do it and same with this one.	1

259158	With the caliber of musicians playing on this album, I expected a hard hitting original. Instead we get re-arranged covers and lots of "filler" salsa. No surprises here. The classic salsa albums are worth your cash but if you are curious, you'll play this one once	0
B000BTAH62:great_mic!:randal_a._harp	We bought this to use with our WS-300M to record a class. We thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording. In the end, we set the recorder to MONO (HQ) because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other! Good quality but distracting. Save your money and buy the mono mic. The quality is excellent in either setting.	1

B000BN3T0Y:poor_quality/hard_to_steer:c._wong	We purchased this stroller because of the weight (10lbs) ease of lifting it/out of the car. Two weeks after purchasing the stroller we noticed that the stitching on the sun shade was already coming apart. The shade is barely big enough to shield anything, let alone provide protection for the child. We received a replacement cover, but was advised that this would be a one time replacement. The tiny cup holder that was not big enough to hold a bottle has already broken off. Our 8 mo. old is 17 lbs. and the stroller is very difficult to maneuver. For straight paths, great. If you have to take a turn or change direction quickly, do NOT plan on having the stroller transition with your directional shift. The front wheels get stuck and you have to kick them back forward or the stroller will not steer correctly when you are going straight. Having had a Pliko previously for my 4 yr old, we thought we could trust the name of Peg Perego. Unless you are seeking a light weight stroller that does not maneuver well, we woud not recommend this stroller to anyone.	0
184886	Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).  The game was short, and I thought the tasks were a bit dull.  I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults	0
179762	I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized.	0
B00064XFJ8:we_love_these_mats!:j._wise_"girls_mom"	We have gone through a few packages of the Table Toppers and we love them!  Our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down....she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive....and she doesn't try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating.  We finally found the Shopper Toppers at Toys R Us and I was so excited I bought two packages....and they don't work worth anything!  The adhesive on those is down the sides, not across the top where it should be, to stick on the shopping cart handle....In fact we've decided that the Table Toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart.  Also, with only a Shopper Topper in our bag while out for lunch recently, we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table!  Well done	1

B000BMJ6VG:too_heavy,_too_big_and_too_bulky:b.b._"twokidsmom"	This stroller is way to heavy, too long, steering is very difficult and too bulky, it is huge when folded.  Try something else.	0
B000F1OF0K:suction_tabs_don't_stay:marthlene_j._dietz_"mjbmpbsab"	We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.  The blinds don't stay up either. Their suctions don't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door.	0

B0002NIM0K:i_love_it!!!!!:t._nguyen_"trudster"	I have a Nissan Sentra so I guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars.  I had the easiest time to put it on.  It popped right on.  It doesn't slide around either.  I bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day.  It's a beautiful steering wheel.  I got seat covers to match with it.  amazon has the best price.  I definitely recommend you guys to buy it.  I usually don't write reviews so this is how satisfied I am with it	1

B000IBFP1K:acrobat_8.0_does_not_work_with_office_2007_vista:frustrated_purchaser	I have a recently purchased Acrobat 8.0 Professional. It installed fine on my new Vista machine, although it cites only Office 2003 products. But I have MS Office 2007.  After installation (and reinstallation) no Acrobat conversion options show on MS Word, and when trying to use Acrobat directly for an MS Word file conversion it first reinstalls itself, and then reports that the Word file (I have tried several) is corrupt.	0
B0000950SM:great_introduction_for_kids:anonymous	We purchased this for my 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter since both children have been asking me to help teach them how to play chess the last several months.  While I have been able to get them started, I find that approach used in this software to introduce the game pieces and concepts has allowed their understanding of the game to grow.	1
1592641164:lazarus_lives.:"gilspat"	I read this book on vacation. Many years ago I read &quot;In The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; and &quot;The Clowns of God.&quot; I enjoyed both of these books but not enought to search out and read the third book in the trilogy.  What a mistake! This book contains the politics of power, the behind the scenes strugles and the fears and doubts as well as the faith and triumphs of the servants of the Vatican, as well as the Italian and international scene.  The relationships both formed, forming and parting kept me glued to the book.  The pace was fast and enthralling.  Do not miss this book. The end was somewhat predictable, but never-the-less still shocking	1
6301815807:causa_sui:jon_c._faith	Eisenstein's verve has never been questioned, even if it was absorbed by living in 'dark times,' to reference Hannah Arendt. This feature is worth anyone's time as the angles of observation and superb editing defy adequate description	1
6300216047:pretty_pretty....:b._adler	I love this movie. Maybe it's because it seemed so risque as a kid, or maybe it's because Jane hates it. Whatever, it's great fun. Sure the script leaves much to be desired. And yea, the special effects suck. It was 1968, what do you want? But that only adds to its charm. It's a funny movie, more on the silly side. This is true camp and if you like campy flicks, this one has to be in your collection	1
B0002U1TRG:what_a_great_seat:mom_of_4_boys	I have always had Graco infant seats for my children. I got this one for baby number 4 and love it. It is so cute! And the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months. Also, I LOVE the color of it.	1
B000EGIDPY:printmaster_platinum_17:p._bender_"phil2246"	Over all I am very happy with the product. It has paid for itself in this short time by just making Happy Birthday cards. I am not totally happy with the product and I am not sure if I would buy it again. The product is well worth the money you are paying but their is a few things which I am not happy about:	1
B000GPNIV2:horrible:j._dixon	Worthless. It rips off your battery door when you try to take the phone off. Flimsy and broke within a week. Not even worth the 0.01 I paid for it which is sad. :	0
B0009QYT3E:very_cute_baby_seat,_but_not_a_rocker.:k._scott	I wouldn't call this a "rocker seat" The kick-stand on it makes it look like a rocker, if you put the stand down..the legs almost touch the floor. You can make it move a little if you have wood floors, but not enough to call it a rocker. If you have a very mellow baby, this chair is perfect. My baby likes to sit and stare at the toys. But if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm, I wouldn't recommend this chair.	1

B000BGWGNM:smells_good:b._e_jackson	When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend, don't tell her it was under 40 dollars!  I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume.  Yeah, like it really smells better just because it's more expensive.  Anyway, Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over.  It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either.  Add just a touch for proper use	1
B0000AQVLF:if_you're_a_school_teacher_and_thinking_about_using_this_film_in_your_class,_please_read_this_first:t._nakajima	Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter?	0

54688	I first caught The Black Swan several years ago on television and was immediately blown away. Sure, it's just a Swashbuckler, just a Pirate film - with the usual plot, the usual bits and pieces. There's nothing outrageously distinctive about The Black Swan, at least at first sight. Ty Power stars as Jamie Boy, expert pirate who ends up by plot machinations in the employ of ex-pirate and now governer of Jamaica, Captain Morgan Laird Cregar). Morgan's been given a pardon for his dastardly deeds and with his new title attempts to rid the seas of the dastardly buccaneers, sending Jamie Boy off to find George Sanders' Captain Leech. Only there's a twist in the mix - and some dastardly fop's out to make a mockery of Morgan by using Leech as his private pirate to ruin the governer. To make matters worse Jamie not only seemingly disappears - apparently in league with the nefarious Leech, but he also kidnaps the previous governer's daughter, played with feistyness by Catherien O'Hara.....	1
314932	This is one of the many magazines that float around the school library, and it is the most common.  Maybe because not too many people read it.  All that is in it is pure celebrity gossip. There is really nothing else in here.  If you like blurry photos of Lindsay Lohan, Donald Trump, Paris Hilton, Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and the like, (blurry so you can't see the zits and the flaws) then you should get this.  One article mentioned Britney Spears stomach, how it was coming back.  She was wearing a baggy t-shirt.  Baggy t-shirts are common among women wanting to hide a gut, not flaunt it.  This magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic (they don't-not so far as I can tell).  If you want to read about the fact that Nichole Richie has acquired yet another Chloe Paddington, the fact that Donald Trump thinks his wife Melania looks hideous now that he has gotten her knocked up, or you would like to see photos of Victoria Beckham looking pissed off, then read this. This magazine is full of lies as well-for instance, one writer claims that young people like Lindsay Lohan can get higher car insurance rates for accidents they were not at fault in.  False!  You only get higher rates if you are at fault. This magazine is nothing more than an overpriced tabloid.  There is nothing of value in here. Half the time the insider is some anonymous friend, and half the time the facts aren't right. Avoid this thing at all costs, unless of course you are a celebrity worshipper. I've got better things to do than worship people who have too much money for their own good.  I'll stick to more intelligent fare, thankyouverymuch	0
B0000GHNT0:nice_kick,_great_flavor,_good_on_anything.:eric_gibson	I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.	1
B000EHIQ00:don't_waste_your_time:ashraf_azmi_"fulltimethinker"	I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low.	0
B00001U0DX:the_end_of_a_great_show_begins.:kenneth_j._devine	THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.	0
436077	Well... It's a great inteligent comedy, which makes enjoy to everyone who whatches it. I'm form Spain and I bought the other three seasons in France. I'll buy it from Amazon, but I would like to know if in England the other seasons offered subtitles in spanish.	1
67812	This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use.  It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right.  The display is large and easy to read and understand.  I definitely would recommend this	1
B000IB4ARK:i_bought_more_and_will_probably_continue:jacob_hantla_"hantla.org"	I purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price. As soon as I received it and wore it twice I went back and purchased three more. The weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and I suspect will give it a long life. After multiple (10+) washings, the first one I purchased still feels as good as the newer ones. The colors are warm. I would suspect that this shirt would cost $10-15. As long as the price stays below $10, I will continue to purchase these as all-purpose daily-wear/work-out tshirt.	1
B0009VTTFW:piece_of_junk:d._schramm	I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.

B00005KFT4:great_for_panasonic_ag-dvc30:w._williams_"power_shopper"	Worked like a charm in my Panasonic AG-DV30 video camera!  Having 5+ hours of battery life really helps when you're on vacation and don't want to mess with charging batteries or being "selective" in your shooting.  This gives you the freedom to tape what you want and edit out the boring stuff later.  Worth the money and a good deal here	1

I saw her in London in the UK, she was still preformed a Unbelievable show on DVD and was just like watchin her when i did in London. By the way, Britney does sing some songs live, like 'Baby One More Time', 'Not A Girl Not Yet A Women' and 'Sometimes' and the reason why she Occasionally does not sing live is because she jumps around and dances and would be out of breathe qucikly... so for that reason she can sing live!!!	1

331706	I grew up on NES and SNES, so seeing these games with new graphics and some bonus features was a very nice surprise for me.  I had just as much fun playing through this game as I did playing FFII for SNES.  Fortunately there were some improvements made in the dialogue, which made it much easier to follow and the characters a little deeper.  Square added in some items and extra equipment.  Also, you have the option to switch between all the characters towards the end of the game, which gives the game a new flavor.  There are some small bugs in it, but most don't hurt the gameplay too much.  The only downfall of this remake is that they took away the weapon-doubling cheat... :-(  Thus, no more stacks of 99 Excallibur swords for Edge to throw..	1
B0009JXYOG:love_it:jennifer_m._hilton	We have had this for along time now.  It works great.  It hasn't rusted or needed parts or repairs.  If you are thinking about getting one but are concerned about the price . . . just buy this one the better product	1

B0000524PF:worth_the_money_for_hdtv_performance!:c._brewer	As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful.	1
B00004RF3M:good_and_funny:love_monkey_#9_"lmno9"	This movie not only has some creative fight scenes, it also has some very funny scenes as well.  Some scenes will have you laughing, and not like other kung fu movies that are stupidly funny, this one is on purpose.	1
B000EIU5ZI:rim_blackberry_7100_series_soft_leather_case:kevin_watford_"bidnessman"	This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case	1
B000IKCCJ4:junk.:gottalovecoffee	First, the item came with a manual marked by the previous owner.  That can be overlooked, but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability.

B000GBUFXA:not_what_i_expected_from_lavazza:l._freed	I drink Lavazza coffee nearly every morning at a local restuarant. When I saw this on Amazon, I assumed it would be great -- but it isn't. Even though this is sold as "drip grind coffee", the grind is way too coarse for a drip coffee maker. The result is that you need to use nearly twice as much coffee to get a decent cup. And decent is as good as it gets -- not great, not even very good -- just decent.	0

I'm glad to see Psylocke & Falcon before the series end, but what about the wildly popular She Hulk. They've got the loser Sabertooth from the Exiles coming out, but not She Hulk.

B000IALMMC:norton_antivirus_2007_is_a_nightmare:robert_peters	I'm responsible for 10 computers at our organization. Last year we purchased Norton Antivirus 2006. It was such a resource hog that it stopped our older computers (550 Mhz) from working and I had to uninstall from all computers. After reading reviews that said 2007 was leaner, I tried to install this on 6 computers. Only 1 install went without problems. Installing on three other computers took 3 days, and I'm still not through with computer 5. Sometimes the program won't install. Once it crashes during install, it leaves behind broken code that prevents reinstall unless you use the Norton uninstall tool, which removes ALL Norton products. So in addition to uninstalling and reinstalling Antivirus, you also have to reinstall Norton Ghost or any other Norton products. On the computer I'm still fighting with the install went smoothly, but during the update the program hung up and now I can't open Norton Antivirus. Even worse, when I open a Word document, the Norton Antivirus starts scanning the document and freezes the computer.  What a nightmare	0
B00005R8BL:good_for_ideas,_but_not_for_"how_to"_information:joe_"joe"	If you are looking to do major renovation work in rooms of an older house, then this magazine will give you some ideas, before and after pictures, etc.  There is precious little about minor jobs, improvements and fixes you may make on an older house.  There is a lot of showcasing new and expensive top of the line stuff.   My needs are more simple.  I want information on fixing and improving things in my house.  I am not a professional contractor.  For the major stuff, I will hire someone.   I have subscribed for three years but find that there is only one or two pages in each issue that can help me.  Their TV show "Ask this old house" is much more informative.  For magazines, I am going to try "Family Handyman" magazine instead.	0
B00000IS0B:deep_disappointment:	I was very disappointed with the quality of this product.  I had to request a second kit because the scented oils bottles were empty in the first kit.  The second kit also had the same problem.  Both kits had to be  returned. It is difficult to determine how fun this kit would be when it is  missing items within the kit	0

63558	I was very disappointed with this magazine.  The tech reviews have absolutely no depth to them.  Most articles are rather pretentious and boring.  In the 5 issues I have received so far only the May 2006 issue had any thing interesting.  And it only had two articles which were worth it.  The first was "Robbed Blind" which was about RFID chips and the second article was "DIY ways to go green"	0
B00000JJAU:the_very_best_of_bobby_vee:lois_murphy_"reading_mom"	The CD is truly the very best of Bobby Vee's works.  A delightful CD.  Even my college age children enjoy the music. Really worth the money	1

B00004RQ0O:unforgettable!:smoothjazzandmore	I viewed this film a few years ago when I had nothing to do and found this to be a masterpiece.  Luis Buuel's direction is unique.  I found that the main character's desposition changes his love for the woman.  When she gets him angry, we see one woman.  When she makes him happy, we see a different woman in the same character.  I don't think I've seen a movie quite like this.  This movie will stay with you for some time, especially if you have a broken heart.	1

98248	I really like this series of books that range from this "Storage" one to "Bathrooms," "Family Houses," etc...  but I am giving this book a 4 because it shows alot of houses that seem to be beyond the means of most people that I know around my area.  This book also likes to tell you to build storage in every little crack/space that does not currently have something useful going for it.  I am giving it 4 stars, because it does inform you of all of the different types of devices that are currently (as of the book being published) available to help you make storage possible in nooks and crannies.  It also gives you ideas and suggestions about how you can make more use out of the storage that you already have, by redesigning the shelving to make it more attractive also.  Try not to read it all at once though, because I started to gloss over stuff just to get to the end of the book.  Take it a step at a time and it will be a great start for you	1

B0006FHBAQ:ripped_off:s._king	These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because "they had already replaced the items". Be careful when ordering from this site	0
B0000B3B95:one_of_the_worst_movies_i've_ever_seen.:angel	Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!	0

B000051SEN:shocking:dave_57	I had a Suunto for 10 months. The face scratched VERY easily which was disappointing. However the worst thing is after swimming in a pool that I could stand up in the watch FILLED with water and died. On returning to Suunto they refused to fix it under warrantee because swimming is not covered ! They say the forces created by swimming are to much for this watch and it was never designed for this purpose, despite the sales literature saying it is water proof to 100m. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER SUUNTO PRODUCT. Whatsmore the shop I bought it from say they have lots returned for the same reason and non of them were fixed under warranty either. It is also very difficult to use and you cannot hear the alarm at all	0

0671647458:unbelievable,_misandrist_,_racist__propoganda_!!!:gregory_higgs	This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.	0

0847821722:noir_mania_for_real:	A quality photography book that visually recounts pertinent steps in the history of noir photography and more specifically, the creation of the term noir as it pertains to film and photography in the 20th c. in New York  City.  A breath of realism, history and fact that beautifully illustrates a  fine curatorial example of the kinds of images published by the Daily News  that made this paper a forerunner in the telling of real stories suffered  and celebrated by real people.  William Hannigan is to be commended for his  fine selection of photographic and negative samples of a time not long past  and still very alive in the movies and crime documents that inspire and  fascinate us today.  A necessary addition to any photo library of value	1

B0006MXPV8:big_breakfast_on_griddle:eric_b._clavier	I'm used to using a teflon coated electric griddle that has much more space than the Baby Q Griddle.  Cooking eggs and pancakes on the cast iron proved challenging and everything cooked much faster (too fast, at first).  The lack of a drain hole made cooking the bacon very greasy.  It got to the point where I had to remove the bacon, remove the griddle, dump the grease and continue cooking.  On the PLUS side the griddle fits perfectly and the included chrome handles make removing the griddle safe and effortless	1
B0007W0IFS:judging_a_book_(or_magazine):j._saltsman_"optimistic_pragmat"	The adage holds steady with this magazine.

B00008G8YT:"i_often_have_the_feeling_that_i'm_passing_through_my_life.":displacedhuman_"displacedhuman"	The slick stylish Spanish thriller "Nobody Knows Anybody" is set in Seville during Holy Week in the year 2000. Newspaper crossword puzzle developer and would-be writer Simon Cardenas (Eduardo Noriega) is struggling as usual with his novel when he receives a cryptic telephone message ordering him to use the word "adversary" as an answer to an upcoming crossword clue. Since the message also contained threats, Simon does what he's told, and he soon finds himself embroiled in a nightmarish sequence of events.	0

I've been using it for about 1 month and I couldn't agree more. A quick spray on the cutters after shaving, and the next time I use it, it runs like new. I can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since I've started using it. As a bonus, it seems to last quite a while. Another strong product from Remington	1

There are lots of custom made maps out there that can bring boardness from official maps, to playing this game 24/7.

B00004CJB5:an_orson_welles_classic:daniel_lee_taylor_"dan57"	The classic comes to the screen and is reincarnated as a classic film.  The film gives just the right touches of a dark moodiness.

The navy bra had a more pointed shape and less padding (which is what I wanted in the first place) I was also disappointed in the sparse stock that was on had...in addition, I had to wait an extra 2 weeks for one of the bras to come in because in the ordering screen I was not informed that it would have to be backordered.  not happy with my overall experience	0

097150072X:hawkins_descends_into_delusion_&_misuse_of_dowsing:jed_shlackman	Dr. Hawkins first book, Power vs Force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology.  However, he began to venture into misapplication of this method, and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity, concept, or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement.  There are serious logical, philosophical, and practical flaws in his work, and his attempt to quantify matters that aren't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests.  This book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques.  The actual technique is worthwhile, but much of what Hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid.  The levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to NOT let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate, valid answers.	0
B0007ZCIUI:turn_back_now_!!!__don't_buy_from_joe_brands!:d._degraw	We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.

542837	Psychology Today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman, but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements.  I give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout, and a second star for hiring writers that don't insult the reader's intelligence by abusing alliteration (unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults).  However, the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people.  I have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect, rather than simply a personality trait (so, introverts, if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong, avoid this rag)	0

B000E8H0BU:really,_500_out_of_5_stars!:k._driskell	My son tells me that he loves his watch and would give it 500 out of 5 stars.  He saved up for it, and he bought it with his own money after his ADHD and Asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders).  He'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having.  It is a cool watch.  It looks good, it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far.  It is waterproof/or resistant, so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok.  This watch was a way that he could solve his own problems, and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties.  That's why I like it so much.	1

It's so... bad. It has some seriously subpar performances from pretty much all involved, and the script was just awful. Gosh, it's hard to believe I actually sat through it. It was just so... exactly what it was, I guess. A stupid sex comedy that's absolutely terrified to be anything else. The thing that really pushed this above the radar for me to blip at was the truly offensive tone of some of the material. I think my real downfall here was the fact that I'm a gay guy whose friends are mostly straight guys. The scenes regarding a certain character and his chance encounter with homosexuality are so repugnant it's almost ridiculous. Now, I'm not one to get offended easily, but this just took it a bit too far. Just the attitudes and behaviors expressed by most of the characters just made me depressed, which isn't really something I look for in a movie. It just seems to me that if 'gay' had been replaced with 'black', this would have been deemed racist and probably wouldn't ever have been released. Not that I'm condoning censorship, but when your tone becomes so... mocking, I guess. Oh well, I guess all I'm trying to say is I will definitely not be repeat viewing this film, and I don't recommend you view it at all if you're a woman, or gay, or you care about others	0
2180	I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off	0
B000FGJVF4:firewire_connection_was_messed_up:mervin_jensen	I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.	0
B0000TLK9Q:good_golly_aunt_lizzie!:eric_criswell	As an avid follower of the Atkins low-carb lifestyle, I am continuously searching for the perfect snack that I can enjoy as much as I want without straying from the diet guidelines.  Thank you Aunt Lizzie's for producing such a delicious high quality zero-carb snack.  I can't get enough of these	1
B0000YE25A:only_the_start_of_your_sushi_making_journey...:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	Once you see the book that accompanies this starter kit, you will realize two things. You won't be making sushi anytime soon without a few more items. Not only do you need fresh ingredients, you need things that are listed in the recipes to make Miso, to make Number-one Dashi and Number-two Dashi. You need Bonito flakes and kombu, you need things like bamboo leaves too. OK, so you don't need bamboo leaves, but having a bamboo plant around the house wouldn't hurt.	1
133057	I had originally heard "Drive Away" on a radio station and I was instantly blown away.  Upon seeing the music video for it, I decided to buy the CD.  I was hardly disappointed.  The emotion that goes into the CD is amazing and it's definitly a CD to sit down and enjoy.  I saw the band in concert and met Jonah after the show and was amazed by how down to earth he was. Give Gratitude a chance and you won't be disappointed.	1
B000098YCP:great_buy_for_any_reason!:andrew_j._gray_"z3r0"	I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer	1
B000FJA0HE:outdoor_table:patricia_esposito	I purchased this prep station for my yard. It is the nicest prep table I have seen for the price. it is durable while still nice looking. Delivery was on time.I did have a problem that some parts were missing from the box but they were replaced free of charge from the merchant	1
B000056OUH:pretty_good_for_the_money:t._brice	I will admit that I had absolutely no desire to sterilize bottles the old fashioned way (boiling water in a pot on the stove) so when I saw this product over seven years ago I bought one immediately. I loved that it was so effortless! PAY ATTENTION to the instructions that tell you how much water to use based on your microwaves wattage. No one wants to wonder if the bottles are sterilized or so-so when it comes to their child, so read the instructions. I also purchased another when my second daughter was born because I gave my sister the first one. My only issue is that because of its small size (it has to fit in the microwave after all!!!!), you have to really stack the bottles, nipples, etc. in a way that utilizes all of the available space. Once again, the instructions clearly tell you the best way to stack. So, if in your sleep deprived, hormonal state you actually manage to read that stupid small instruction booklet you will save yourself a lot of heartache	1
B00004VWM1:the_best_big_accessory_for_your_weber:mr._upright	My wife bought me this for me a couple years ago. I think she had an ulterior motive: for me to make the Thanksgiving turkey when all of her family came to visit. I did, and it was simply outstanding! I have done several turkeys, chickens, and roasts on this rotisserie and they all turned out perfect with very little effort. If you have a 22.5-inch Weber kettle, you need this rotisserie	1
B0002EXJ98:the_worst_online_experience_of_my_life:daniel_witham	The ad and description clearly state that it includes both a receiver and transmitter.  I received only a receiver. This is false advertising and is patently illegal. They ought to be ashamed of themrselves	0
600707	It does what it advertises. The bodyfat readings do fluctuate, but that's normal, it gives you a good general idea of how much bodyfat you have, and it gives a simple reading of whether your bmi with your body fat is low, normal, high, too high. I got it for about 25 bucks so good buy.	1
1581805527:i_was_very_impressed:muriel_masse_"art_student"	I was very impressed to find this very nice book. I've heard about a Quebecois who painted for the popular singer Celine Dion (I'm from Quebec, Canada myself), I wanted to see and I'm very proud of it. Huge ceilings and wonderful murals !  Wow. Felicitations	1
B00003RQO8:noir_classic:bomojaz	Edmund O'Brien is a CPA who decides to get away to San Francisco for a weekend to sow some wild oats (and also to get away from his secretary who's nagging him to marry her). There he's poisoned and told he has only a few days to live; he tries to find out who poisoned him and why. The trail takes him into a world of corruption and double dealing. Following this trail is a bit confusing for O'Brien and the audience. But the picture is tightly directed and well acted. A highly regarded film-noir entry, and rightly so. Worth a watch	1
93341	This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription	0

B00005MF8U:broken_out_of_the_box,_and_charbroil_doesn't_care:e._barta_"oldschool"	After experiencing the same thing that many on here have witnessed (after 8 hours the smoker didn't get hot enough, and I had to finish my meat in the oven), I decided to ask Char-broil support on their website what I can do to remedy the situation.	0
170927	I have always loved Mario, and when I purchased my new Nintendo DS Lite, I bought this with it. This game is absolutely amazingly fun! The graphics, sound, and the game itself are incredible. This game is good for any adult or child. Although for a younger child, it might be a bit more difficult and possibly frustrating. ;) With this game you have to try some of the harder levels over again, and possibly again after that. But every time you try again, you understand something new about the level, and it really is fun. There also are the features of becoming Mega Mario and Mini Mario which mixes things up every once and a while. This game is wonderful, definitely a great buy.	1

B000EMUZ54:great_taste.:charjere_"charjere"	I recieved the variety pack today and tried this flavor first. I buy natural snacks for my kids (freeze dried fruit etc with no added sugar), but I find them bland. So I ordered these and I love them. In fact my 4 year old wanted to try and she liked it - it wasn't too spicy for her. You can tell they used "hot" spices, but they are very well done so as to not be too much. The nuts are big and crunchy and the fruit is small and chewy. There is about equal of both nuts and fruit. They do use evaporated cane juice and organic tapioca syrup, but these are healthier than alternatives and there are still only 5 grams of sugar per 1/4 cup serving	1
319205	I saw this movie twice, the second time knowing exactly why I wanted to see it again. If you are trying to find out if you love someone or not, make sure that you see this movie. Such a simple but yet such a powerful definition of love it gives. Explains why we are where we are, and makes you part of the harmony. Is love as simple as teaching someone to bike? Think about it.	1
B000GRCUJQ:great_organic_cookie!:healthy_mom_"healthy_mom"	I love these cookies! The only complaint I had is that I ordered a case (12 boxes) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day I received the shipment. Yikes, I still have over half the case left and I've been eating them daily (and giving them away)! I probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone. However, if you're looking for a great, organic cookie without trans fats, this is a nice healthy option	1
B0007VDN6K:jaxa_wrench_does_not_come_with_the_bits_that_go_in_the_three_holes.:hiro_protagonist	... which makes the wrench completely useless.  I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits.  Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made.  Do not buy this product	0
B000FDBQE6:healthy,_hearty_and_tasty...and_how_to_cook_it.:m._l._kent	This cereal really tastes good. I make it in the microwave, first heating the fresh cold water to boiling, then adding the cereal, stirring and returning it to the microwave to finish cooking. I let it boil and bubble for a bit in the microwave, which is when the cooking really occurs. I often let it sit in the microwave for a few minutes after it stops, to set up. Years ago a ham radio guy asked me (over the air!) whether I knew how to make gourmet microwave hot cereal. I said no - wondering how you could make anything gourmet, especially cooked cereal, in the microwave - but that I didn't express out loud... so he explained to me the above method, with emphasis on heating the cold water before adding the cereal. And definitely not using hot tap water, as that has the O2 chased out of it, or some such. So I guess that must be it!	1

B00009N4H5:they_shrink...big.:michael_c._pendola	I have usually found Jockey underwear to be a value in that they generally last a long time, which makes it a little less painful when you have to pay the premium price that appears to be controlled, no matter where you find them sold. However the last couple of their articles that I purchase through Amazon, namely the Pouch Trunk Underware, and "A" style under shirts appear fine out of the package but shrink to about half size when laundered. I wear a medium size (32" waist medium build) and purchased the same in both products. And both of these products are "painfully small" after laundered. I tried to wear them anyway, hoping that they would stretch out to their original size as the day wore on. But they were just uncomfortably too short, and tight.	0
B000H4085G:twist_board_exactly_as_designed:corinne_a._halvorsen_"ch1023"	I wanted a simple, portable way to enjoy moving my body more.  This is it.  I just hop on it during commercials or when I need to get up and move from my desk.  It works.	1
B00000JNF4:this_is_one_fun_party_game!:"debbie-n-va"	This is one of the most fun games I've every played.  There are tons of belly laughs as people try to bluff their way through an answer to a question.  I find the questions (and answers) are quite educational too, I've learned a lot from these questions.  A group of family members played at Christmas (6 of us) and it was hilarious to watch some people try to come up with an answer to the question (a bluff).   We even let our 5 year old nephew "play" and he was pretty good with coming up with some bluffs.  Try it, it is loads of fun.  I recommend a group of at least 4 though	1
320128	I just got this game last night and I am amazed. EA Sports really delivered with this one. The Race for the Heisman mode is simply amazing. All the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing. The game is probably the best football game i have ever played. Definately a must have for any Football Fan	1
B000BU1H5G:great_machine:kathie_lee_"kath"	Nice machine for doing quick clean-ups, stairs and car. A bit heavy but great suction. Not thrilled with the method in which the hose for accessories is hooked up but a small price to pay for a good job. Worth the minor frustration	1

B000KHF7ZQ:fantastic_smartphone:i._elkhatib_"gadget_geek"	I have gone through several smartphones in the past 4 months (Including, Cingular HTC 8125, and Nokia E62)  and can safely say that this is the best phone I have owned.   The Palm operating system is much easier to use than the Windows operating system ( albeit, less powerful) and much more customizable and synchronization-friendly than the Symbian OS.  Its great for easy installation of software.	1
B000CORSF4:too_sweet!:beach_lover	I made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site.  I have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating.  I couldn't taste any caramel or other flavor, just straight sugar. If you are considering this product and haven't tasted it before, I highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you don't waste your money	0
583700	I loved the experience, especially with the smart picks, smart templates, smart search, and smart rank.  I recommend it to any user.  Very happy with the product!	1
6304084307:those_were_the_years...:h._cason	To say this is a great film is probably an overstatement, but it certainly is a great idea for a film. Gibson looks good, Weaver looks good, Hunt acts good, Weir directs good, and the script is better than good. Much. It's a movie about ideas, which earns high marks these days, as so few flics can make that claim. Sure, it stumbles a bit, and the ending is purposely frustrating, to carry forward the theme of White Guilt and "What then shall we do?" Beyond all that, it's sensual, and unpredictable, and pretty damned intelligent. Seen anything lately in the multiplex that fits that bill? I ain't. See it for yourself.	1

B000009CIS:one_of_the_most_slept_on_classics:h._cuthbertson_"thebaldheadnut"	I usually don't do album reviews but I gotta say this was tight from beginning to end and I was shook that this was given a low reading by a magazine I call &quot;The Sauce&quot; So many of yall need to stop reading magazine ratings and come to sites likes this and read your own peers ratings.  Word of mouth is bliss. A-G-2-A-KE who came out on Rap-A-Lot hasn't come out with a cd since this classic.  I'm salty they didn't &quot;make it&quot; because this was heavily slept on	1
b000000tct:dissapointing:a._magana_"momio"	This is nothing compared to their EP, which was great by the way. Songs lack of inventive, arrangements and feeling... maybe a couple of songs are to be rescued, but no more	0
491387	This straight-to-video's modest budget is attested to by the fact that while most of the action is supposed to take place at a large state prison, this prison only seems to house about 12 inmates. The plot is that old but reliable one about a man posing as a prisoner so he can go "undercover" and solve a crime. The crime in this case is not especially interesting and it's resolved in much too pat a fashion. However, leading man Tommy Lee Thomas looks good with his shirt off, (though he seems too small to be throwing his weight around), and there's a torture scene, (modeled on the one in "Lethal Weapon"), in which he's hanged by his wrists and zapped with electric shocks. Mr. Thomas' performance may not be of Oscar caliber but he does know how to yell.	0

B0000E6ZC6:don't_waste_your_money!!!:mags_"mags"	I bought this item because our son kept on getting his legs and arms stuck.  This item was made for a portable/small crib, not your typical crib.  I had to go out and spend another $40. on velcro so I can make it long/wide enough to fit my son's crib.  It is not worth the aggravation in altering it to fit the crib.  Don't waste your money on something that is not going to work.	0
B00062MT7E:turbine_tool_should_be_recalled:catmom_"sylvia"	For the Animal DC17 to be such a great vacuum, I thought I was using the turbine tool incorrectly.

I emailed Dyson to inquire as how to use the tool correctly and they have never responded.	0

B000BTHJCM:undamaged_delivery_in_2_days:p._canzano	Received my pack of 4 in 2 days with the free ship option. Shop-Rite sells individual box for 8.99, so even the regular price of $32 beat that. The $10 additional promotion was icing on the cake	1
473118	First off, most people don't buy this magazine in order to salivate over what they don't have but desperately want--at least, I don't.  This magazine is a wonderful inspiration for those of us who are interested in making the most of our home and free time.  Isn't our home supposed to be a haven?  Someplace to return to from the hustle, bustle and craziness of the day and just relax and spend time making memories and creating joy in our lives and of those we love.  This magazine simply caters to people with that ethic.  It's always full of ideas--both trendy and traditional.  It's not full of "BUY, BUY, BUY!" hyper-consumerist propoganda--it simply presents current trends and new ideas to keep your haven fresh and fun.  Anyone with a lick of sense and an ounce of self-respect doesn't turn to home magazines looking to be led, like a sheep, into the latest buying frenzy.  Most of us are smart enough to flip through the pages and get ideas of things we like and then find clever, inexpensive ways to incorporate them into our own lives--on our own budget.  This magazine is always full of beautiful pictures, great advice, and even terrific information about how and where to find bargains.  Mainly, though, it's about making the most of what you've got, and using your free-time to truly enjoy life to its fullest.  Don't fall for the neosocialist rhetoric of the first review.  This magazine is worth every penny	1
B000051SE7:great_for_digital_camera.:carl_schmidt	I used four of these for a digital camera (Kodak DC3200) and the camera took approximately 200 pictures. Compared to what was previously in it, 200 is a lot. I also used a couple of these batteries in a portable radio/cd player. The usage time was phenominal considering there were several times when I had the radio in my backpack and it would get turned on from hitting something in the bag and would remain on for long periods of time. It still works to this day on the same two batteries	1

B000BYCI00:maybe_for_light_duty...:consummate_shopper	This canister vac might be ok for VERY light duty, but don't expect it to handle any "real" housecleaning.  The filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating, which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot.	0
B000AMECSE:excellent_replacement_for_my_old_graco!:r._bullock	We received a Graco travel system from our registry, and got some good use out of it. However, we are in a big city, and the stroller just couldn't stand up to the bad sidewalks and roads. Not to mention it was so rickety I'm positive we could be heard a mile away. I broke down and ordered the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain jogger, and I LOVE it.	1
B0009FUTNE:great_sound,_great_price!:wilhelmina_gaudy_"coolartsybabe"	I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab.	1
B000GGB91C:mostly_dry:lund_wolfe	I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.	1
B00028LDII:great_gum!:a_satisfied_gamer	They didn't lie in the description! This stuff does have a delightful flavor that is both sweet and tart. Thing is, I had no idea it would be so STRONG! These little sticks of gum pack some serious flavor, and it lasts a long time. A worthwhile buy, I say	1
B000EQ9LOG:what_a_let_down.:c._d._maylone	I ordered the Saturday Morning Special gift set and tried the Tui Herbal Shampoo right away.  As with everyone else, no lather and lots of tangles.  After the second wash, I decided to use my Pantene Relaxed and Natural to try and get some lather and moisture in my hair.  This stuff is a rip off.  On the plus side, it works fabulously on my children's hair. They are bi-racial and have naturally curly hair.  I don't recommend this to anyone with relaxed hair.  It just doesn't work	0
B000BO0L0E:a_real_gem!:beachcomber	This is a terrific tour of Hawaii.  The photography is incredible and it shows Hawaii's breathtaking scenery including beautiful beaches on Oahu and Maui, Mt. Haleakala and Waimea Canyon.  The music's great and the narration includes lots of travel tips as you're completely immersed in a Hawaiian vacation - volcanoes, exciting nightlife, surfing, scuba dives and hulas that "were so alluring that the missionaries banned them".  The only person who would not like this DVD simply doesn't want to unwind and relax during this fascinating travel guide.  After you see this you'll want to explore this paradise yourself and this DVD will help you plan your trip or your honeymoon	1
B0009V6U3Q:believe_it!!!_it_works!!:nc	I bought this product for my husband. He tried it out on one of the hottest days. Sunny and 90 degrees. He is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours. This really works. Not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing. It looked as if he did the vehicles the old way. There were no streaks. The truck looked like it was polished. Unbelievable...... I would recommend this product to anyone. Buy it !!!!!!	1
406069	The American Spectator is a must read for anyone considering themselves an intellectual. Not only are the articles witty and well-researched, they also provide well-articulated arguments to the most pressing (if sometimes slighlty out of date) controversies of the times. Well worth the subscription price, or even the cover price	1
B0002VG57O:somehow_not_as_good_as_birks:l._supheert	They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me	0

B000N471R8:better_than_foretold:datapoint3000	I read a negative review of this show but I just watched it and it was better than foretold.  I expect it will do better than people think.

46960	Fable is easily one of the greatest games to ever be released. The story of a boy who grows up to become a hero and still wants revenge for the tragedy of his past, it is compelling and very entertaining. The gameplay  is excellent, it's not your typical RPG since this plays like an action/adventure game. I love how you can choose to be good or bad and the choices you make reflect on what your character looks like.	1
B00005B6ZR:would_not_recommend:barbara_r_jones	I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair.  For the money I don't think they were worth it	0
296974	I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.

B000JD3AIW:works_with_simplicity:b._eng	My feelings are...if you have simple income, not a lot of financial dealings, this program will walk you thru your returns with no difficulty. I've only done Fed & State with 2 incomes, 1 home, with all the associated deductions and the program handled everything. Using the program is a snap and it saves me about $200-300 over using a tax preparer, who asks me questions just like this program does. You simply need to sort out all your receipts, etc., the same as you need to do for a live preparer	1
B000CR41CY:original_is_great,_wheat/dairy_free_is_a_bit_tough:k._bateman_"kathik"	I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety	1
B000FNSM9I:so_unusual!:dreampeaceluv444	I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug.

124394	The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying.	0
584310	I'de have never read Vibe in the first place, but i won a free years subscription in some online contest.  And i must also mention i'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture, so i'de think Vibe would be tight.....daamn, was i ever wrong.  First off, half the mag is Advertising....then what little reading there is....it's all bullsh**.  The interviews they have with artists are totally weak & watered down.  They never ask any worthwhile questions.  Vibe also contradicts itself constantly.  In one issue, they'll give an album a low rating & a poor review, then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best....what the f***?  Vibe has it's decent moments, but i def. won't be paying for it anytime soon.	0

424449	This is a great game for any skilled star wars game freak. The graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is very fun and challenging don't listen to the negative reviews claiming the game is to hard, the people who claim it's to hard are just weak at video games granted the game can frustrate but it never get's to the point where you want to throw the game out the window.

Attak, was really weak because it was all Sascha and Skold and though I like them both, the absence of Gunter Schulz and En Esch really made this album absent in itself.

B00006NWA3:not_functional,_poor_quality...:brenda_lee_"brenda_lee"	Not functional, bought it as a gift and could not give it after looking at it and trying to put a roll of paper towels on it.  Impossible to use -the rod and rod top and base are not aligned properly nor made properly. Also, it came in a box that was damaged and taped together (not the shipping box, the Polder box that the product comes in)...looks like someone returned it previously (probably for the same reasons) and it was then sent to me.  I still have it because I was not able to return it within the 30 days alloted. Time to throw it out - waste of money	0
B000IVU2GS:used?:v._andrews	We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product	0
B000FJEYYY:sennheiser_mx55v_stereo_headphones:michael_j._smith	These headphones sound pretty good, but they aren't the best.  When running, the volume controller gets in the way and bounces.  It is also easy to change the volume which is annoying.  I also find the fact that the cord for the right side is longer than the other a little bit strange.  I realize it is done intentionally, but it does nothing for me.  Overall, for just listening at your desk or in your room, these are great headphones.  For running, I would recommend something else	1

392369	This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child.  There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker.  There is some padding on the top, but not enough.  The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added.  Overall not a good value at all for the price.	0

B00007GDES:passable_second_wallet:shanaz_sukhdeo_"'why_buy'_guy"	This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic	0
B000088UNY:great_lightweight_plastic_ramps.:penumbra	This ramp set is really fun to skate on, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of damage. First it will begin to slide when you skate on it due to lost rubber bottoms. Screwing screws into the edges of the ramp can somewhat solve this problem. The worst thing that happens is when the front of the ramp begins to curl upward, making it so you have to constantly pull it back down. I forgot to do this one time and my skateboard wheels locked up and I went flying. But don't let this turn you away. It is a good fly box nonetheless, but just keep in mind that a homemade wooden one would last you a lifetime, not a year.	0
B00006FXOP:informative_and_entertaining:tlf_"lotr-obsessed_book_lover"	Muse is one of my all-time favorite magazines. I'm 15 (which is above the recommended age) and I STILL enjoy it.

B000CIWYVS:thomas_lover:t.k.	My son loves this game.  When moving around the tracks, in the one game it can be difficult, the key is if you moving up or down, depending on which direction you need to go, push the joystick the direction once and let go, after that push the joystick the direction the train needs to go. I hope this helps.  My son will be 3 in less then a month and it took him a week to figure out how to move around the tracks.  Mom, dad and sis had to play before that.  The other games are a little easier, but I found the games educational and my son loves it	1

B00020J16W:great_watch:budaandi	This watch is you would expect from any Timex watch.  It's easy to read the face while running, easy to set, big button on the front for the light so no fumbing when wearing gloves for the little side button on some.  It's lightweight if a bit stiff to start with, but eventually easied a bit with age.  I only use it for running timing, not my everyday watch, but I'll buy one again when I lose this one (as I usually lose them long before they wear out).  I haven't had it long enough to notice any real wear in the band yet, not sure if it'll wear out easier or not, but so far, so good (1 year)	1
543597	The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck	0
243252	This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories.	1
B00081L334:great_for_potty_training_early!!!:alana_estelle	I was a little apprehensive about ordering this product, as I read all of the negative comments.  I ordered it anyway, because good comments described the potty as one that would benefit my son. When it arrived (earlier than expected), I noticed that it was easy to assemble, and that because it is not made with very thick plastic, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to order this for BIG children who are potty training.  My son is 18 months old, and 22 lbs, and it is perfect for him, sturdy enough for him to climb up and use the potty.  He really enjoys climbing up himself, and it does encourage him to be more independent in the process.  I let him look at the box, and we talked about how the little girl was going potty, and he liked seeing the little girl on the box :) using the potty, "just like him".  So if your child is very big, or potty training at 3+ years, I wouldn't order this,they don't need it. I would just get a stool	1
B000CD8BCY:great_little_gem!:terifrancis_"terifrancis"	I stumbled across this little gem by accident.  I was picking up supplies at Office Depot and they had a Kodak Z650 (display model) on sale for under $100. It was a ridiculous impulse buy--I already own 4 digital cameras ... the last thing I needed was another camera! But what a delighful suprise this camera turned out to be! It's come the closest to rivaling the image quality of my old Olympus C-740.	1
410831	Grand Theft Auto is now in 3rd person perspective! No more overhead camera. Well, at least it's not the only mode of view. That in itself makes this game great. You're an escaped convict that's trying to establish a name for himself and make some money by completing missions. The cities are virtually yours. Vast, easy to explore, no limitations. You can jump and hijack any car, beat a poor old lady with a baseball bat, even steal police cars. But don't go too trigger-happy, or else the feds will be all over you.	1

When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.	0
B0007VO08U:a_terrific_walker:c._keller	My husband was totally delighted with the Rollator Walker.  It is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new, much more attractive kind.  It folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things.  When folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large.  We put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more can you ask	1
B000HHWU4K:lovely_shoes!__just_a_little_narrow:capitol_hillite_"karen_k"	I just got these and love them.  My only complaint is that they pinch/are a little narrow, even though I don't have wide feet or regularly wear wide shoes.  The dark red color is a little deeper than the picture, but that is a good thing if you want to wear these in both winter and summer.  If you're gonna buy red shoes or any other colors available, these are a great choice	1

The unique feature of this capo is that you can flip it around, for example, cover the 3rd 4th and 5th strings on the second fret to convert it to an open E B A E B E tuning from a standard E B G D A E tuning. Very reliable and fun. Highly recommended	1

0312354371:oh_please!:emily_ragsdale_"bollywood_fanatic"	As my brother said when flipping through this book, "If girls start acting like guys then what do we need them for?"  Why should you pretend to be someone or something you're not to get a guy?  If someone dumps you because you like mushy love songs, cry at sad movies, like babies and puppies, or because you have embarrassing girl products in your medicine cabinet, he isn't worth it anyway!  And why on earth would you sleep with someone who didn't love you enough to want you around the next morning?  "Think Like a Guy" doesn't guarantee you a perfect relationship anymore than The Rules or Stop Getting Dumped or Mars and Venus or any of the other ridiculous relationship books that have been popular over the last few years.  Be yourself.  If a man can't deal with that, then he isn't the right one for you	0
B000050B6U:perfect_for_home_or_salon:california_spa_owner	We purchased eight of these (6 - 3/4 in. and 2 - 1 in.) for our beauty salon in 1994, and we've never used another brand since. With their quick heat-up time and multi-level heat options, these irons perform superbly for precision curls.  I was so pleased their performance that I bought one to use at home to replace my fancy Vidal Sassoon gold barrel, which only had two heat settings - Too Hot and Burnt Scalp.  The heating element is so efficient that Level 1 or 2 is probably sufficient for most home users.  Rarely did I have to set the iron at Level 4 or 5, and never above 5.  It takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up.  Four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through 3+ years of constant professional use.  At the price we paid, our weekly cost averaged out to pennies.  If you purchase this product you will -NOT- be disappointed	1
0395448956:the_best_dictionary_available:	This is by far the best dictionary on the market.  Far better than Merriam-Webster's outdated and obtuse dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary is a dictionary for the 21st century.  It is up-to-date,  informative, pleasing to look at and browse.  I would gladly pay full price  for this dictionary.  Finally, I can discard my outdate M-W dictionary.   What a joy	1
B000HKYN7O:great_classic_for_a_great_price:l._cerny	With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.	1
B0008G2V76:excellent_machine_-_with_some_easy_modifications:j._dimick	When I got the machine and started putting it together, I noticed I was missing a few small pieces.  Understandable, I think, as this machine was shipped from Germany.  3$ and a trip to my local hardware store later, the Kettler Kadett was all assembled.  I had some problems with the foot straps loosening while I exercised, but I found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area (to provide an additional foot strap) and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem.	1
552127	Spin will do anything to try and stay hip. I wanted to gag when i saw a picture of blink 182 in their &quot;tribute&quot; to kurt cobain mag. Im a huge nirvana fan and the only good thing about those articles were the pictures. they were poorly written and dull. they didnt even scrape the surface of kurt's music, and his impact on an entire generation. i suggest maybe guitar world or anything other then spin..	0
B0009PU91G:very_poor_quality:k._conner	I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness.  But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets.  I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little "balls" felt scratchy).  My husband asked me why we were using the "old" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn!  I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply "doesn't happen with their sheets".  So I exchanged them with an identical pair.  And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products	0
B000EML79W:very_unusual_"junk"_food:sergey_nosov_"tobject"	These snacks are crunchy and mildly peppery. The taste resembles that of cottage cheese. A little under salted for my taste, but still great. Watch out for blobs of undissolved jalapeo mix, you probably do not want to bite into those.	1
B0001GV58E:does_not_fit_r817:adam_bushcott	This dock does NOT fit the R817 Camera.  Just bought this and the HP R817 and I am very disappointed.  The input for the camera is to big for the 817.

B00007AVYI:no_mysteries_here._just_solid_car_talk.:david_a._baer	As your grandfather told you, you can't always judge a book by its cover. Nor, these days, does the title of a magazine always clue you into the content that begins on page three.	1
B000I3U27U:this_is_supposed_to_be_a_comedy,_but_where's_the_proof?:m._a._bechaz_"bookaholic"	This isn't funny. It isn't well directed or scripted. Perhaps it could have been great, if it had had a decent scriptwriter or director, but it didn't, so it turned out mediocre at best. Unfortunately, I believed all the hype on this website and bought a copy of this for my boyfriend and I to watch. I told my boyfriend that according to most of the reviews I'd read, this was going to be a brilliant, hilarious cult classic. But now that we've watched it, he and I both know better. We know it's dreadful, and I can only imagine all the nice things I'm going to have to do for him to make up for my expecting him to sit through this tedious monstrosity. The only highlight for us was a spirited argument he and I got into halfway through the movie about where we'd seen one of the actors in the movie before. I'm pleased to say I won the argument. That was pretty much the only highlight of the movie for me.	0
B000IY84II:lifecore_r900_rowing_machine:bill	The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon	1
B000E4C2LW:long-time_user_(eater)_-_love_'em!:grits	I've been buying Nature's Path gluten free foods for a number of years, and have been fully satisfied.  I've had access to somewhat lower prices than what traditional grocery stores put on their products, but am delighted that Amazon's price is virtually identical to the prices offered by the discount organic foods market we've purchased these from in the past.  I doubt you'll find Nature's Path products any lower anywhere else, particularly when you consider no sales tax and free shipping if the order is large enough.  Also, I contacted Nature's Path once with a question about one of their products (the Mesa Sunrise flakes).  Customer service is excellent and very friendly (much nicer than we typically get "down here" in the States - they're a Canadian company up in B.C.).  If this sounds like a commercial, it's not intended to be - I just have been entirely satisfied with Nature's Path foods for years and have no complaints at all.  When a company does a good job, they deserve referrals - everybody wins	1
B000LX3P76:"out_of_ear"_ear_buds:c._plummer	I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!	0
B00073ILEC:awesome_camera:kamini_mistry_"punk_princess"	I so love the size and shape of this camera. This one takes some good pictures, and appear to be quite clear. It's better than the integrated camera on my cell phone. This camera may seem like it's taken a poor quality image, but when you transfer them onto a pc, they seem so clear! However it is recommended that you get a memory card for this camera as it only has 14mb of internal memory. As this camera was a gift to me, I'd have to say it was the best birthday present I have received	1

B000C22J2S:good_for_the_price:soundmom_"rachel"	I bought this for my reluctant potty-trainer, and he's used it once and tried to go in it several times, but the real blessing has been his 6-year-old brother using it. I have one bathroom, and one very messy boy who never lifts the toilet seat. This has saved me from having to clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises. I do have to check the collection reservoir a lot, though, because my older son does "go" a lot, as big boys will. The flushing mechanism works well and is a necessary part - it saves a lot of time you may spend scrubbing and rinsing a traditional training potty. Plus, the pee collects in a part of the potty the child doesn't have easy access to, unlike a trainer potty that they can pee in, then stand up and step in or put on their head when your back is turned for a second (I speak from experience). Makes it much more sanitary.	1
B000GLNCJO:yuk!:kathy_w	Not at all what I wanted.  It is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you don't want them pushed.  Ordered 2 and plan to return them.

254914	We bought this game knowing Shrek movies are a bit raunchy, but thinking the game would be ok for a 6 year old to play.After watching my son play this game for a few minutes... I saw that he had to stun chickens and put them in a pot of boiling water while they were still alive. Then after that, he punched large turtles and threw them on tables where there backs were cracked open and died.  I can't believe a game that is rated E for Everyone would have little kids (or whoever played it) have to be so mean to animals.  What's next, ripping the head off a rabbit? I consider myself one of the coolest moms around, but this totally crossed the line	0
360242	I stumbled on these in Whole Foods and decided to buy a couple of packages.  I have NEVER been disappointed with anything I have eaten them with.  Maybe it's because I am a heck of a cook! :-) This are not pasta they ARE tofu. If you are looking for something to be negative and skeptical about YOU WILL FIND IT.  I could eat these noodles with home made spaghetti sauce every single day!  Go ahead, try them for yourself...If you have an open mind, you will NOT be disappointed!  Also, the shipping should not be a bad reflection on the quality/taste of the product it's self. This stuff is GREAT...look for them in a store near you so you won't have to worry about the shipping...	1

B000ERU83I:yukk!!!:frances_ortiz_"franka"	She doesn't sing... SHE YELLS!!! And using one of Ednita's songs as she did with "Lo que son las cosas" is just sacrilege at its "best" (or worst). It's really easy to hit it big with your first single when the song is already a classic by itself. She has absolutely nothing on Beyonce or Cristina Aguilera. Her cd is just plain bad! If you want to hear good music by latin women with beautiful powerful voices (and that actually SING), you might want to look for La Lupe, Celia Cruz, Ednita Nazario and Lucecita Benitez... and these are only the ones I remembered at the moment	0

B0000X0XJU:rip_off:kimberjs	I bought one of the Brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it was still priced at $99.00 (on February 1, 2007), based on two positive reviews that were posted at that time.  Initially, I was impressed by the prompt delivery of the product but immediately discovered the bike was not factory assembled correctly.  Instead of a left- and right-hand crank arm, my exercise bike has two right hand crank arms.  This may seem trivial until you realize that the cranks are suppose to be threaded in opposite directions to prevent the pedals from coming unscrewed during use.	0

B0002YTN4I:awesome_ramps:jerome_lucas_"mr._lucas"	I have a 02 Dodge Intrepid plus a 05 Chrysler Pacifica, I was a little hesitant to go under my vehicle's at first but from multiple test try's (Up & Down) you can tell they are built well and can hold the weight. I'm 354lbs and had no problems going under, My Intrepid transmission shifter cable broke and putting a new one on was a breeze thanks to the ramps, I also change my transmission fluid and filter. personally I love the ramps, the fact they are lightweight and strong  makes them a keeper. I'm saving so much money because of the ramps, no more going to the dealership for over priced oil changes (LOL) I saved $200 putting the new shifter cable on my Intrepid. THE RAMPS ARE AWESOME..	1

B000AM4ZT0:a_cult_classic_-_for_good_reason:a._kim	Since I was in high school, so many women have praised the wonders of Almost Lipstick in Black Honey.  I finally self-gifted and purchased for myself, and all of my expectations have been met.  The color is initially scary in the tube, but at the very least swipe it on your hand - you'll see that it is actually a very wearable sheer brownish raspberry color.  You can layer it for a stronger color, or swipe it over lip balm to make it even more sheer.  The resulting effect is your lips, but better.  The color of your lips is improved and they are moist and shiny looking.  If you layer repeatedly over dry lips it is a very shiny deep red brown color.  I've seen Black Honey worn by fair/medium Asian and White women and has looked flattering on every one of them.  Lastly, the product does not smell.  It has no perfumes that become disgusting as the day wears on, nor does it have that cheap waxy smell/taste.  A fabulous product	1

So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.	1

340500	Now, this isn't the fastest card on the market.  But it is a solid, reliable card.  The camera itself is the bottle kneck, and typically not this card.  However, if you are using a Canon DSLR of a recent flavor, I would check if it needs to be RMA'd.  A known quantity of these cards have proven to lose images.  scary.  However, I've not experienced the mysterious loss of images with my card or Rebel XT.  I've only ever pushed the cards speed limits with my PD70X, and definately not with my Rebel XT	1
B00008WEHZ:save_your_money:ron_gallegos	seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception.  i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal.  price-wise, it was great.  however, it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well.  the directions are terrible.  they are extremely difficult to follow.  i never could get it to sync with outlook.  i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work.  i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child's play in comparison.  in this case, you get what you pay for.  don't purchase this, you'll be sorry.   Take care, it's a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly, the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much.  punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen, ad nauseum.  do you carry the manual with you.  put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the English language.  truly disappointed with this worthless plastic.	0

B000K2NKUA:taxes_made_simple:r._raymoure_"not_an_accountant"	If you don't have an overly complicated tax return I found that TaxCut is great to use.  The thing I like most is the interview.  Even if you don't think you qualify for what it is asking, say "yes".  It will ask more questions.  If indeed you don't qualify you have lost nothing and can proceed with the interview.  In tax year 2005 it uncovered something I had missed and I filed ammended returns for 2004 & 2005 and pocketed $300.  I also was excited about e-filing and direct deposit.  I filed in early February and had both my Federal and State refunds in my account in three weeks.  It comes with Deduction Pro which makes keeping track of things very simple and it all imports for next year.	1

66218	The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it.	0

Can use it for cultural discussions of music, social issues, history of Cuba, current policies toward Cuba, etc.  Most expecially, kids like music and the life stories of the musicians are quite moving.

B00004R8M2:fabulous_storage_for_all_our_puzzles....:livin'_the_good_life	My three children are huge fans of Melissa and Doug puzzles and with as many as we own we sure needed a way to store them neatly.  Being an organization freak myself, I was in search of the perfect storage case.  Not only did it need to hold many puzzles, but it needed to be made well and look nice too.  Melissa and Doug to the rescue - once again!  We purchased the same storage case in natural and it's been a life saver in our toy room - it makes it easy for them to put the puzzles away without them losing pieces anymore.  You might find it hard to spend $30 on an empty storage case so I suggest looking for the storage case that comes with six puzzles for $60 instead.  More for your money!  In our case, we own so many puzzles that we didn't need anymore and especially duplicates of what we already have	1
291036	I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an "indoor walk" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout	0
B000H151PQ:way_to_big!:s._thomason	This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?	0
B000GTHU12:don't_do_it!!!:paul_statman	Don't waste your money. That's the short version. No stars for this P.O.S. Want more? OK - once you've fiddled around and fitted the rubber strips to your window, hooked on the device, rolled up your window (facing the sun, of course) you're now late for whatever it was you just parked to go do. Oh yes, and it doesn't do anything other than spin a joke fan that couldn't move a feather. I put my hand in front of it and felt nothing - no wonder my car still feels like an oven. We can't drive off with it on, as the wind noise is unbearable even after unhooking the unit. Why? Because of the 'sealing' rubber strip you've hooked over the top of the glass leaving a nice 4mm gap for the wind.	0

0064470598:jacob_have_i_loved_:	I personally do not see how this book could have won a Newbery medal. While the author portrays sibling rivalry effectively, that is about the only positive aspect of this book. The fact that the teenage girl protagonist has a crush on an elderly man is disgusting and is presented as not only being acceptable but understandable. Sara's family is also unsupportive to her sulky and jealous attitudes. Her grandmother is a busybody and consantly antagonizes the family. Sara's twin sister gets all the attention and love, leaving Sara starving for parental care. Finally, Christianity is portrayed as harsh and judgemental. This book could possibly be acceptable for adults but never for children and I would not recommend it to anyone. I wasted my time with this book: please don't waste yours.	0

B00004RALJ:works_well,_great_value:peter_lin	I bought the grill for father's day and found it a great purchase. I've been thinking about getting a new grill, but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. Even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap, it is pretty solid. I've only used it once so far, but it works nicely. I can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill, 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. It took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. I used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook, it started to rain. Thanks to the unpredictable NorthEast weather. Since the grill is portable, I picked it up and moved to the garage. Try that with a standup grill.	1

B000FEGUJ6:good_from_the_start:a._schnick	I bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for Christmas.  It was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using.  He has been enjoying the features offered by this device.  He especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use.  It gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves.  He has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints.  It was a great price for a quality product	1
B000CE9IAM:horrible_product_this_year:susan	I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax	0

499121	Yeah, I know it's the industry standard, and it's powerful, and all that stuff.  But, MY GOD, what a freaking PAIN to use.  It's just plain tedious to draw anything from scratch.  While the interface in CS2 is an improvement, doing relatively simple drawings with primitive shapes and freehand curves still requires much more effort than it reasonably should.  Frankly, I could draw better stuff faster with 1990's-era Macintosh drawing programs.  The drawing issues are compounded by the fact that -- in true Adobe spirit -- this program is incredibly bloated and slow.  It's slow doing EVERYTHING... I've never seen a program so slow starting up.  And every time you save a file (even a tiny drawing with 10 shapes) you get a "saving file" progress bar for a few seconds.  It's also incredibly slow to shut down... frequently taking about 30 seconds.  I'm running it on a Pentium M laptop, and I know this is not a "graphics professional" machine, but COME ON!  Let's get the lead out!  I just get the sense that Adobe pays no attention whatsoever to efficiency or speed.  That bugs me a lot	0
76095	Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.	0
B000FBP1IA:you_have_to_try_this_cereal!:c._humphrey	My son loves this cereal!!!  I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box, so when it was on sale I would stock up.  I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients.  He said he didn't like it as well, but I thought he was just imagining the difference.  Well, I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference.  He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around!  He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas!  Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well.	1

248634	I like some of the other Walden Farms products -- I gave their chocolate dip 4 stars -- but this one is not very good. I tried dipping different kinds of fruit into it, tried it in combination with the chocolate dip, and finally gave up and threw the rest of it away. The cellulose gel Walden Farms uses to give its sauces body seems to have a slight spicy/sour "bite" to it; it doesn't bother me in the chocolate dip or in most of their dressings, but here it ruins the flavor	0

377937	I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund	0

6301658167:pleasing,but_no_chop_top:kevin_"jay"	TCM III was a good movie.It had all the necessary tools and villians to make a good horror movie.It lacked the essential characters,though.It would've done better if they had brought Chop Top or Drayton back to life.The film is about two friends headed down to Florida from Texas when they come upon a pit of decayed bodies.We already know it was Leatherface,and the two drive on.The next day,they come upon a gas station,where a crazy,yet funny gas station attendant named Alfredo work.Also making his appearance here as well is Viggo Mortenson as Tex,a redneck cowboy who gives the two friends guidance.The two take the road he suggests after a near attack and end up stranded in the woods,pursued by the evr vigialnt Leatherface armed with his trusty chainsaw.It gets the job done every time.As in the Texas Chainsaw tradition,they are captured and prepared for dinner.One of the friends narrowly escapes and must take on Leatherface with the help of an Veteran they met along the way.It's an overall good movie and I loved it	1
B000B8WATU:messed_up_my_skin!:mick	OMG - if you decide to use this use it SPARINGLY!!!!  I can't stress it enough.

I had been using Clean & Clear salicylic (sp?) acid products with no trouble so figured this wouldn't be much different.  Boy was I wrong!  The first week was great; week #2 the nightmare began... I wound up these huge, brownish-red, sore, swollen, itchy bumps/scabs on my face.  I have since stopped that portion of the treatment and am now moisturizing my face back to health.  Last night my bf said it looks better than the 'pizza face' from the Philosophy products.  Yikes!  Try at your own risk but take it slow	0
223901	I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.	0

B000K0QZY0:taking_it_back...:on_to_baby_2!_"lissa325i"	I purchased this swing because we were out of town and it was much needed.  We have the full sized Papasan swing and the travel Ocean Wonders swings at home (which in retrospect, we were wishing we brought with us).  While neither of those are 100% perfect, they are much better than this one.  The open frame allows the child to kick the swing frame, stop the swing from moving, and potentially get their feet/legs stuck in between the bars.  ALso, the swing seat almost lays horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position)while swinging, to the point that I am afraid if my daughter would wiggle a bit, she would end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Lastly, the mobile is horrible.  It's pitiful and I find it hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market.  It's a plastic leaf that has little notches for two toys on strings.  The strings have a not on the end of them and you slide it into the notches.  These toys remain on the notches for approximately 3 seconds.  It's a very poor design and needs a LOT of work.  And my daughter ends up in a crumbled up ball on one side of the swing more times than not - it doesn't seem to have the support that our other 2 swings have.	0

62932	I have had my Canon Eos 30D for about a week and after 500 shutter actuations I am completely addicted to photography.  I bought the 17-85mm Canon lens and it takes phenomenal pics especially using the software and post-processing in RAW.  I also have a 70-300mm lens for sports/outdoors/nature and bursts of 5fps are a beautiful sound.  I bought the Camera through Dell and with rebates currently this is the best deal out there!  Strongly recommend.  Pay the extra $$$ and get this over the Rebel XTI.  You won't be disappointed	1
B000ETBXBW:a_good_option:baixinho_"moose"	High ISO and large screen were the reasons for my purchase. The screen is great but, when you force the ISO 1600, it seems to darken the pictures more than in 800. I have a S5200 and that one seems to adjust other options like white balance much better when an ISO is set w/o having to go to full Manual option. Definitely something to improve! The auto option seems to work much better and I was surprised with how good the high speed three frame shooting works. Also, the two picture function(it takes two with slightly different sets automatically) saves me on a lot of 're-posing	1
B0007XGOU0:video_security_camera:design_engineer	This particular Cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it, it will blow you away.  I've heard people complain about Dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support, autually their tech support sucks but I don't need them.  This is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully.  When you actually learn how to use it, you won't buy anything else for the price.  If you are tech savey, you will really enjoy the product.  I have nine cams installed at three locations.  Using their IP software you can view upto 16 at once.  The reason I'm back, on this site, is because I need to order two more.  I did have to return my first one but it was a pre-production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear.  Dlink sent my replacement direct.  The oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now.  One last comment, the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay 50% more with less features	1

B000E1HW6A:terrible_sound_quality:c._chien	This camcorder has an excellent form factor and conveniently transfers clips to PC via USB. However, the camera picks up the sound of its own zoom and auto-focus, which makes the video unacceptable in my opinion. The clicking and whirring is louder than the level of normal conversation.	0
B00064ATVK:good_pump:bernie	I decided to by this pump instead of the single because it saves time to do both sides at once. This pump works very well and I quickly get the milk I need. I like that there are different levels of suction to fit my comfort. I gave it four stars because it is a little difficult to change speeds and adjust with both hands being occupied. Sometimes one side looses suction and while I am trying to fix it the other side looses suction because I had to remove my hand from holding it in place	1
475669	From reading the other reviews, I seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my A530.  Within a month after buying it, the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on.  I have to manually flick open the shutter/cover.  Then, the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction (that is, it works to "zoom in" on something, to zoom back out I have to turn the camera off and back on.   To my knowledge, the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems.	0
B0004F7HTS:excellent_college_student_tool:rji_"rji"	Extremely useful item for any college student.  Not only can it save wall space due to its magnetic capability, but it is excellent for keeping track of what needs to be done for the day/week/etc.  Mounting it onto a wall is so easy that instructions are not needed	1
414659	This DVD is amazing!  Perfectly puts the Blues on display through the high-points and the low points of the season.  The best thing about this dvd, besides the flying, is the respect they show the crew.  Yeah, the pilots get the glory and do the high flying cool stuff, but, they are FAAAAR from the stars of the show!  The maintainers and support people behind the flying is where the stars hide.  This dvd also shines the light on the pilots and what they do.  They truly go through the mill, but, they don't do a single thing with those Blue jets if the crew does not do their job perfectly.  This is FINALLY a dvd that shines the light on the pilots, BUT, makes it clear that nothing happens without the crew in support of the pilots.  Great Job!!!	1

B0001BW0RO:this_table_is_very_flimsy_and_overpriced:linda	I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock.  The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site.  Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping.  I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic.  This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping!  (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table.	0
B0007A5OXG:no_excuses!:nikki_giovanni_"e"	This is the perfect companion to take on your next trip.  No more excuses.  The gym is now portable.  With enough resistance to give you a decent workout.  This gym rat highly recommend these bands.	1
B000780866:wifi_seeker_exceeded_my_expectations:bart_beasley	When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.  It worked fine.  But as time went on I saw these smaller versions come out from Chrysalis Development.  I heard they were more powerful and more versatile.  So I bought one.  I was NOT disappointed.  Since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car, it fit perfectly on my keychain.  Also it has a much longer range than the others.  But best of all, it is directional.  Meaning I can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the LEDs change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases.  What a great product. I Love it!	1
B0009PG35M:never_buying_nike_running_shoes_again:shanik	Seriously, went into the store to find new running shoes, possibly the air 360.  Was wearing shoxs in the store.  Threw them away immediately.  These are the best shoes I've worn in a long while.  I'm one of those ppl that like to take off my shoes as soon as I get home.  I forgot that these were on, they were that comfortable.  I'm a heavy, parttime runner.  Nothing over 5K as I am just starting again.  They support my weight extremely well	1
B000EVIDW2:yummy_angel_food!:cb	I have used this cake mix many, many times.  The first time my daughter made it for me for my birthday.  She said she thought it would be difficult to make it with a hand mixer but was a "snap" with my large stand mixer.  I have since made it many times and it is a favorite for birthday parties in our office even though I am the only gluten-free person.  I add fresh orange juice and peel instead of the vanilla and serve it with strawberries or fresh fruit and whip cream...yummy	1
272734	It looks great, genuine leather, much better than synthetic. Like a brand named leather wallet. But there is no where you can tie the case to the camera. Hence you have to hold onto it with another hand when you pull the camera out to take photos.  There is no where to put the essential accessories (battery and another memory stick). There is no way to clip to the belt. Will like to return if if not the hassle of mailing and the associated cost. Bought another handy synthetic case afterwards	0

249919	I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better.  I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with.  I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos.  I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean	1

B000H846KK:great_distraction_for_hungry_baby:michelle_c_"baby_jack's_mommy"	This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.	1
B0000011OX:great_cd:e._keegan	First of all i'm a die hard UFO fan,i own EVERY UFO album not just the michael shenker cd's...some of you fools reviewing the ufo albums without michael ..1) do the band a disservice 2)are smokin crack, and 3) are very inept in your musical judgement. While i'm a huge shenker fan he is far from the greatest guitar god,and i hate to break the news to ya's but for overall sound/effect and appeal paul chapmans just good as michael on many a song. That bein said MAKING CONTACT is one of the top five UFO albums MADE!!!! the top five UFO albums any fan should get are (PHENOMENON,LIGHTS OUT,NO PLACE TO RUN,MAKING CONTACT,and WALK ON WATER) along with the two live cd's BBC,and strangers in the night. Misdemeaner has some cool 80's guitar and is an attempt at mainstream(and they deserve to be mainstream) so who can blame them,and some of these songs are pretty cool...IF,I might add if you have an open mind (so that excludes most of you shenker diehards)...........	1
B0001KO9RE:love_it:c._boyle_"loving_parents"	I got this gift from my husband I love the machine it so easy to use. I read so many other and I was afraid I was not going to get the machine and go buy my normal coffee but I bought the coffe, syrups and much more just to make them like the coffee shop was easy. The only thing I don't like is the height of th cup area or the noise. I had to go purchase other cups and them dump it into my bigger cups. They do offer you to buy a attachment for the bigger cups.	1

B00005N5TE:don't_even_bother!:scott_mccrary	Okay, I was excited to see this movie.  I read a few non fiction books on the dot.com bust and thought I knew a thing or two, but when I watched this movie focus on petty relationships and nothing more, I found myself wondering what planet these film makers were from.  I mean, WHO cares about these people's relationships??  NOT ANYONE WHO IS WATCHING THIS MOVIE!  We care about why and how businesses succeed and fail.  This movie sucked	0
184956	this game has a 25 minute introduction or story.  Square Enix was really creative and the stories are so good!  However I do expect them to put something like "Skip Intro" cause impatient people could really get mad at the stories!  I, however only get a game every five months so I am fine with that.  This is only a minor flaw.  Another flaw is that when you want to look at the map or statistics, you have to wait 5 seconds until it appears.  Very annoying, but again a minor flaw.  This game depends on how much you like to battle the same creatures over and over and over again!  It get very boring after awhile.  You have to train those dumb spirits and sometimes you just want them to level up quicker.  This game gets very boring after awhile and you will want to ditch the game as well as the characters.  There is not much action and you have a limited amount of monsters to battle.	0

I shook the bag, felt for the necklace, and finally out popped this itty bitty tiny heart pendant. it's so small, i thought it was more suitable for her doll then for herself. i was very disappointed. other then the size and over priced tag, i thought it was cute - but i will be returning it.	0
B0009A4F16:too_different_to_other_barbies:mozilla_firefix	I have bought quite a few barbies from Amazon recently, including the caligirl series, fashion fever series, and barbie loves micky mouse. This barbie is quite different to all above. She does not have a rubber skin like others, so we may see her leg joints if she is wearing a skirt or shorts. Her foot is quite flat; only the slippers in this package fit her; all other barbies' shoes do not. I guess this "pooh" might be made with the "former generation" technology	0
B000F34IBE:high_quality_and_excellent_value:robert_p._molina_"molingo"	These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried.  And given their low price, what is there not to like?  I would recommend these to just about anyone	1
548965	This was a great buy from Amazons sale rack at five dollars and 29 cents plus free shipping.  My [...] just loves puzzles and we are certainly fond of Melissa and Doug products.  We normally purchase them from Tuesday Morning or our local hobby store because they are usually cheaper.	1
B00009UHXR:a_successful_connectivity!_:efthimios_efthimiopoulos_"e2"	Unless that I made an order for Terk Technologies Leapfrog LF-30S Wireless 2.4 GHz A/V Distribution System, I received another wireless system from TERK Co, but the point is that this system is working properly, and right now I'm able to have Greek TV via internet to my desktop, and via the TERK wireless system downstairs to my living-room TV appliance. During the operational time, I saw that I don't have good resolution. I don't know if the reason is because this distance between my office and my living-room (the office is above from the living-room - so there is no big distance at all).	1
B0006U67H4:junk:disgusted	This is the worst purchase I have made from Amazon or anyone else. The "first" unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable. After a number of calls to tech support, it was decided to return and replace the unit. Amazon promptly replaced the treadmill. This one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function. My friend at tech support did not have a clue. He suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit. It is not clear what I am to do with them. I strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer	0
B0002ZA2BA:poor_quality:nicki_herrell_"kaden's_mommy"	(2 stars because the style is cool...)this was a christmas gift from my husband this year as our son is a big boy (19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it was too much to carry him, his carrier and a heavy diaper bag everyday to daycare so this seemed like the perfect solution... and it was... until the bag started coming apart 7 days after I received it! And I was careful, I had read some of the other reviews about the stitches coming apart and I had thought they had just over filled the bag... nope! The bottle holder has ripped all the way down the side... you can't overfill that... there's just room for one bottle, isn't that what it is made for???	0

B0001DHSFG:pilates_segment_okay;_cardio_segment_truly_lame!_:e._karvala	The basic pilates mat exercises are performed, which are okay; however, the cardio segment of this video is truly lame!  The instructor runs the viewer through marching, marching and stretching one's arm at the same time and, finally, marching and kicking back one's leg.  That's it.  How incredibly dull!  What's worse, the instructor has a terribly artificial clenched-tooth smile plastered to her face for the duration.  "Pilates for Dummies" is a far better instructional video for newcomers to the world of pilates (do a series of jumping jacks or go for a run afterwards to get in your cardio).  I wouldn't waste your time w/ this video.	0
B000E3TPQ8:lovely_aroma,_beautiful_presentation:knitting_zeal	Adagio has outdone themselves with this creation.  Jasmine Bloom Display Tea starts out as a tight ball of leaves, the size of a quarter.  Add some hot water, and the ball unfurls it's leaves of Jasmine green tea revealing a strand of delicate white flowers arching over the green tea starburst.  The aroma is a delicate, perfumed scent of Jasmine blossoms, the color is a pale green, and the taste is light and mellow.  The hand-tied tea blooms are nicer to look at than taste, however, I recommend trying this tea just for the fun of it.	1

I have been in public accounting for 10 years, and i am now ready to start my own firm.  I wasted my money on buying this book.

501577	I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.	0

169549	I love InStyle.  I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle.  It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion.  It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas.  It sticks to fashion and I like that.  That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will.  The best out there.  MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue.  I love it	1
163281	I have subscribed to Discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription.  The magazine, which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag.

B0006NGVOU:beads,_beads_and_more_beads...:livin'_the_good_life	We have several boxes of these Melissa And Doug bead sets b/c we just can't get enough of them!  My three children (twin boys - one girl) love to sit and make necklaces over and over again!  YES!  My boys love this too!!!  It's a great exercise for their fine motor skills!  The patience they have all developed to sit and string these small beads together is wonderful!  It's great practice for them as they create different patterns with each new necklace.  I suggest getting a few boxes - especially if you have more than one child playing with them at the same time.  Our favorite set includes letters so they can each spell out their own name or other words.	1
158620	Some other people have complain about the quality, if you're a print graphic artist then its problem.  As a web designer who need 2" by 2" graphics, this set is great.  You do get a variety of photos of objects.  For example, there's like 20 different examples of a live garnade, something like several hundred coins from different countries.  For $17 this is definitely worth the money.	1
45752	With the PS2's life cycle coming to an end, there are hardly any new games that are anything remotely spectacular.  Capcom's Okami however, is just that, and it's not just one of the best games to ever grace the PS2, it's one of the most original games you'll ever play.  The first thing you'll notice about Okami is the game's incredibly unique art style and graphics, which are some of the best to ever grace the PS2.  Seriously, this game looks incredible, you won't believe your eyes.  Okami's storyline is based on Japanese legend dealing with the sun god Amaterasu, who you play as in the form of a white wolf, and the epic quest that awaits him.  Now, what truly sets Okami apart from the rest of the pack is the caligraphy-esque celestial brush that you must use to advance throughout the game.  Need a bridge?  Draw it.  Need to dispatch a pesky enemy?  Draw him in half.  This brush adds a new dynamic to the gameplay which is fresh and unique, and makes you wonder why no one has ever tried anything like it before in a game of this type.  There's loads of side quests and mini-games as well, adding to the length of Okami which truly make it an epic game, and all of which help make this one of the best games ever on the PS2.  If there's anything bad to say about Okami, it's that the combat can get too easy at spots, but that is only an extremely minor gripe.  All in all, Okami is just the thing that PS2 owners have been waiting and yearning for.  An original, epic adventure that doesn't get stale and provides some of the most unique and mouth watering graphics you'll ever see.  If you own a PS2, Okami is an absolute must own, and it's one of the best games you'll ever play	1
B000CRCNLU:poor_product:dan_-_milwaukee	Bought this mirror at target, along with many other Eddie Bauer baby products available there.

B0009RENAW:write_music_that_looks_like_music.:emily_a._combs_"daisyanna"	As a retired teacher, I wanted the ability to compose a song and share it in a pristine form.  Finale SongWriter does that.  The lyrics find their way to the correct note.  The Midi connection works and all the parts of a composition is enveloped in this software. One of the attractions for me is the cost.  Finale SongWriter does not extract your final dollar from your stash.  Try this program, and you will find many facets hidden that makes Finale SongWriter a positive	1

0807845280:delinquent_girls_and_their_minders:"kiki361"	A pathbreaking work in women's history and the history of deviancy, this book argues (if not entirely convincingly) for a new interpretation of the history and relationship of girl delinquents and women reformers. Odem  traces the history of middle class women reformers towards sexual  delinquency by young girls through the particularly rich case history of  Los Angeles County. Noting the diverse cultures in L.A. (white, working  class, Hispanic, African-American) Odem argues that many girls who became  labeled &quot;wayward&quot; were acting out against oppressive and  repressive families who held old-fashioned and patriarchal views of girls'  sexuality. Odem also explores the eventually oppressive route that  reformers took in &quot;retraining&quot; wayward girls	1
394425	I used to enjoyed Discover, but the past several months of their radicals changes, got me to think a real dumbing down.Once in awhile, they would put together a good article - but not constantly.How can we enlighten ourselves and improve our intelligence on science etc in the world stage.There are still many of us that do not want to be glued to the computer for science as we would for the tv.Discover's editorial staff ought to get their magazine back on track or the circulation and subscriber base is going to go down the tube. Thank goodness Scientific American, Astronomy, Sky and Telescope, Science News havent fallen down.I am not renewing my subscription unless Discover 'rediscovers' itself.How dumb Americans are!	0
81939	Cook's Illustrated is the first cooking magazine that I'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover, even though they DO insert advertisements for their own products, which I suppose, to them, makes this an "ad-free" magazine, but I'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. The one time I found it necessary to contact Cook's Illustrated about a customer service issue, I was simply floored by the treatment that I received... I'll simply leave it at that.	0

B0007YAOS2:rare_replica_is_priceless:ally	I bought this as a memento of a brilliant but modest necklace I had seen at the Smithsonian Institute.  I love the grand central stone as well as the modern multi-strands of this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear.  By far, the intricate detail present reminds me of the jewelery owned by ladies of the royal court.  With so much class it is still affordable.  This necklace is an exceptional gem.	1
B000C49RXA:don't__waste_your_money.:marta_lukasik_"cosmetic_freak"	The Philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. Well, this is for sure true, when you use this Kit Kit. I have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using Acne Kit Kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. I'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. I was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. All they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. Soon I have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough I WAS USING an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. I dont get it- I was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. For the same price I could have bought stuff that really works-the one that Vanessa Williams is happy with. I know cause I tried it, didn't make my skin feel like Sahara and will be my next choice. Save your money. P.S. The oxygen peel is O.K. dough	0

The item has been in stock the whole time so I'm not sure what has caused the delay.  I'm just thankful I ordered it just to try it out, and that I didn't actually need it by any certain date.	0

B0000D8GGS:wonderful_camera_for_basic_needs:h._p._ramesh_"hpr"	Got this camera in 1999 and it is still doing very well!  More than 3000 great pictures have been taken.  The camera is very easy to use and needs no maintenance.  A word of caution - ensure that the camera doesn't get pressurized laterally - this can happen if it is stuffed in a bag and someone sleeps over it.  The spring-operated shutter is very sensitive.	1

B000034DCJ:very_versatile_-_once_you_know_it's_many_uses!:a._harris	I purchased this sling from ebay for $8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it, we did just that.  It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product, and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it, I now COMFORTABLY, have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure.  I am petite and this is one size fits all, you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter.  If you have problems with the baby being secure, you just need to pull up the material high on the back (theirs and yours) AND tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand.  I am now VERY impressed with this product, a little knowledge goes a long way!  The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php  ~ once you see how to use this product correctly, you WILL LOVE IT!  :o)  I do now	1

B000ICRXIW:sour_espresso:d._sanders	This type of machine just cannot make good espresso. Espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans, correct temperature of water, and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time. With a quick/no-fuss machine like the Tassimo, some of these ingredients are missing from this machine's process, so the espresso turns out rather sour. Adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it, but it's not a great latte either. Stick with regular coffee in the Tassimo, and although it's not wonderful either, it might get you through the morning	0

B0002HYD5E:not_as_pictured:lorelai_"gilmoregirl"	I received my order today, and discovered (as with all of the Hasa products in my order) that although more than one item is pictured--  only one comes with the order.  The item itself is very small, 2 1/2" X 1".  That, fine, I can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood, lifesize would make play a work-out for most children. However, shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for ONE item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising	0

0131427911:blatant_errors_-_poor_scholarship:benjamin_winters	I picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others, hoping to learn about America's prison system.  I think our prison system is horrible and I was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic.  Unfortunately, in the first twenty pages of the book, Elsner claims that America imprisons 704 people per every 10,000 citizens.  If you do the math, that equals 7% of our population. 7% of our population is greater than the population of the State of New York.  According to this author, there are more people in prison in this country than live in the State of New York.	0
B00069BVEE:i_wouldn't_still_be_nursing_if_i_didn't_have_this_pump:r._rawls_"wappingers_falls,_ny"	I've been using this pump for ten months now and it is the main reason I'm still nursing my little girl.  I went back to work when she was four months old and started pumping three times per day.  At first it was hard to try to be productive for the 20 minutes per session I was pumping because you really do have to hold the breast shield to the breast, suction isn't enough.  Then I got the Easy Expression Hands-free Bustier which has solved that problem.  I can now do e-mail, talk on conference calls, etc. while I'm pumping so I don't waste time at work and continue to give my baby the benefits of human milk.  I'm able to fit four standard bottles and two of the smaller/slimmer Medela bottles into the small cooler, with the ice pack so I don't think the cooler is too small.  Also, I don't think the cooler was meant to be transported in the backpack.  If you don't try to cram the cooler in the backpack there's no problem with storage in the backpack.  I also reccomend the Medela Micro-Steam bags for working moms who choose to pump once they go back to work. Also, I don't think the suction is too hard...yes it may be uncomfortable for the first minute or two until the pressure of engorgement has been reduced, but it is by no means painful.  Pain is what I experience when my daughter bites with her new razor-sharp teeth!	1

B000059TEP:low_expectations,_great_impressions:randy_keehn	I'm not sure why I never watched "Ghost" before until last night.  For some reason, I didn't pay much heed to it when it was first released and never thought it was worth watching on TV.  I'm glad I gave it a chance because this is a GOOD movie.  What makes it good is its' skillful mixture of suspense, romance, comedy, and the supernatural.  That would seem to be too much to tackle for one movie but we get it all in the right balance.  I was drawn rather quickly into the movie and got to where I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  There were a few "convenient" capabilities that these ghosts had that were necessary for the story to work.  I'm a rather pragmatic person but, by the time these things came up, I was so caught up in the story that I WANTED these things to be possible.	1

B000B5I0O2:customer_service_rating_is_1_star_or_less.:lee_henry	The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned. Customer Service exists but their reps claim they can't do anything about your problem. Their manners are less than acceptable. Rude seems to be the "in-thing" at this company. As consumers, we have options; one of which is to ge elsewhere. I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned. It's too bad	0

B0008GM6JO:beware_cs2_--_stick_wih_cs!:peter_payne_"peter_in_japan"	If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support	0

388312	This game is amazing. Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title	1
B000K7UG20:bad_description_of_product:anthony_pipola_"dissappointed"	I bought this movie for my husband because its one of his faves.

B0006J31WO:they_fall_apart_at_high_speeds:r._zuckerman	I bought the goggles and was excited by the look. They are kind of "Riddick" like.

I gave them to my daughter and she will try to wear them skiing. They definately are not for extreme sports. They are also too big for casual use as sun glasses.	0

B00029TCRQ:nothing_but_a_headache:deb_"deb"	I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.	0
B000B8J73M:very_cute.....but_durability_a_concern:shonda_"bubblz"	I bought this as a Christmas present for my 4-year-old daughter.  She is a huge My Little Pony fan.  Ponyville lives in our house in fact.  We got it out and played with it for a couple hours.  We didn't have the problems described with the hand crank.  That seems to be very durable.  The problem is with the flower that Zippee goes in.  A pony steps on the flower to open the flower and then you wind the gear counter clockwise to close it.	0

B000E617U2:your_island_in_the_sun:ellie_"eilean_siar"	This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every peny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it	1
231917	I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all.  Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process.

B00006L0D8:only_when_i'm_desperate...:shanti_r._"effervescent_adolescent"	Like a reviewer below said, this magazine was good a while back. Try back in 2002. It used to have better tips and less filler. Now, it's all filler. Seriously. There are maybe 5 quizzes which don't say much, a "dream decoder" which is complete phooey, and yes, the many tweeny posters that I'd be embarassed to have on my wall, even if I were 11. I grew, but sadly, this magazine did not, let alone stay the same. Nothing is serious in here, it's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read.	0

0915190087:not_a_good_tale_for_any_age:mm	I too read the TA for Tots to my 3-5 year-old 30 years ago.  She loved it a lot so I've been looking for it again, this time for my grand-daughter.  Even though the title is different from the original one I knew, I purchased it and  read it as soon as I received it.  Bottomline: this story is _not_ the original one and I don't like it at all.  Other than showing stereotypical Happy Prince and Princess fairy tale characters (which I can live with up to a point), I saw bunches of red flags when I got to the evil witch, drawn with a full-blown ugly face "who was very clever and devised a very wicked plan".  Unhappy because there are so many happy warm-fuzzy people around she freely starts giving away cold pricklies.  Without enough warm fuzzies (we read earlier) it puts people "in danger of developing a sickness in their backs which caused them to shrivel up and die".  Ouch.  So instead of embracing the wisdom of old women, here we have another story that villifies them (OK, I'm a psychotherapist also and know all too well how these images affect us all).  No, it's not funny, and there is no way I would introduce this book to any child.  The book also does not do a good job of showing clear examples of what warm fuzzies and cold pricklies really are, as the original book did.  Too bad, for using images of "warm fuzzies" and "cold pricklies" is an easy way to introduce feelings and consequences of behaviors to young children.  I am returning the book.	0

B0006UF43M:flimsy_as_a_stroller:ashish_mathur	I found the product highly unsafe as a stroller. The handle is very flimsy, and is not strong enough to control the direction of the stroller. Also the wheels do not lock properly and safely. Its ok as a car seat but as a stroller has a lot to improve	0
B00021BK60:beautiful_shades:elizabeth_a._borst	What a great modern selection of elegant colors and what a perfectly textured eye shadow. Paula Dorf says "Where are the brights? Not here" and calls the shadows "softly muted". That is true but don't take that to mean there is no life to this shadow. It's also named Glimmer and it does have a slight velvety glimmer to it. The selection of very wearable colors has a shade for everyone. I bought the gold, which is subtle but is still gold. I love the way it goes on and it's suitable for day or night. Paula Dorf will never have you looking like a clown but I don't find these shades boring either.	1

B000BM8FR2:great_bottle:k.p._"addison's_mommy"	I tried several different bottles, including Avent and Second Nature, and this is the only one that my baby could get a good suction on and didn't flow too fast or make her gag. The nipples are the same as the pacifier given to me at the hospital (which is the only pacifier she will take as well). I am breastfeeding, and with all of the trouble I was having findnig a bottle, I was worried about what would happen when I went back to work and my baby had to be fed from a bottle. This bottle has eased my mind. Also, the wide neck make washing easier than any other bottles. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it will leak if the top is not on really tight, but as long as I make sure it is tight I have no problems	1
433398	Yes, there may be some small issues with the sound quality, but you get used to it, and Wilhelm Kempff is definitely one of the great pianists of the 20th Century, so it is worth it. These are incredible performances that are often justly called definitive. Kempff seems to always bring out every theme of every work and magnifies its emotional intensity, whereas other pianists would not have nearly as much attention to detail and neglect many subtle themes.

322898	Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.	1
405586	This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments).	1
B0002IQ162:great_dvd_recording_media:w._combs_"rooshing"	I've never tried verbatim media, since there were 5inch computer floppy disc (circa 1983-85).  I pleased to find that verbatim still makes a quality product	1

B00004RCAR:great_jazzy_funk_album:james_wax	What I love most about Scofield's recent guitar playing is the subtlety in his style. He is careful not to over do it, while still demonstrating skill and precision. His riffs are practically perfect and are very well placed.  The only problem with this is that with no vocals and many similar sounding  songs, I rarely make it to the end of this CD. Still for those who enjoyed  &quot;A Go-Go&quot;, this one is quite similar, so make sure to pick it up.  This quality funk CD with jazz undertones may not being groundbraking, but  is a great casual listen. (Guitarist can definitely pick up a few ideas  here!	1
B000FJP0QU:no_record_speed:d._sutton	Have used many types of dvd-r. This the only one I have found that didn't have a record speed encoded in it and was unusable. Tried different locations on the spindle and the same results. Would have been a good buy if they worked. Gave it only one star because there was no 1/2 star	0
B0009K9Q2E:misadvertising:m._raible_"surprised_customer"	The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems.  HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM.  Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment	0
B0000CDD2U:great_product_and_service.:pete	First, I would like to say, with a bit of trial and error, this is a very good product. Well worth the price. I want to comment on the great technical support from La Crosse, and the super customer support from Amazon. The first unit I received was faulty due to being calibrated wrong. Left La Crosse a voice mail and was called within 36 hours. Tried to trouble shoot to no avail. La Crosse followed up next day. E-mailed Amazon about issue, replacement was in mail the next day. Outstanding	1
B000NRWK6M:everything's_lost_in_this_world,_including_the_plot.:	This was a really dissapointing remake of the great adventure story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It didn't really seem to follow the original novel other than the names of the lead characters. The plot and scripting are  incredibly weak, it seems the editors just stopped mid-movie and rolled the  credits there. The CGI dinosaurs' appearances were impressive but their  animation was very stiff. In my opinion, not worth the $83 it costs	0

B000BNJIE0:do_not_buy_this_toy!:beth_"bz"	No wonder they are selling a 30 dollar toy for 5 bucks, it does not work and the quality is sub par.

I gave one star because you have to, but I would give negitive stars if I could	0
B000FCN6IQ:very_well_made_boots_by_nine_west:cdc	The Nine West Botamy boots are comfortable and really well made. The leather is very soft also. Even though the toe is very pointed, these boots are still comfortable. Amazon has a great price on these boots	1
B00074ON20:defective_unit:disgruntled	My wife purchased this toy box at our local Toys R Us.

B00006WNOQ:worthless:prinado	Wow, what a fine example of terrible engineering. The only control is a knob that ranges from OFF to SUPER. To set the thermostat, you  turn the knob to the SUPER setting. When the room reaches a comfortable level, you slowly turn the thermostat down until the heater goes off. This is the point at which the thermostat setting equals the room temp. At this setting, the thermostat will automatically turn on and off to maintain the selected temp.	0

As for now I wanted to get this out to Amazon customers so I am using my neighbors computer	0
B0002XRWSI:using_camera:arthur_crosby	Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it.	1
B0002EQT5Y:learning_to_make_and_appreciate_music:joanna_daneman	Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.	1

1591791529:transportive_and_restorative:loves2read	This is one of the most beautiful, restorative collections of Celtic music I have ever heard.  Haunting, sublime harp, cello, guitar, flute, and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation, prayer, or simply unwinding the mind and emotions.  The poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself.  Highly recommended	1

B000050AP8:completely_useless_and_ineffective:l._daener	This product is a waste of money. The mice in my room are completely unaffected, and walk right by the device without any sign of concern. Besides being ineffective, the devices themselves make a slight buzzing sound (not silent as advertised). I now have to buy a set of (humane) mousetraps, and I recommend that anyone reading this do the same and save themselves $40	0
532585	I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.	1
B000056W4W:solution_to_feeding_my_baby:g.a._"mom_of_two"	I had trouble getting my breastfed baby to take an Avent bottle (which my first took beautifully) so I called the lactation consultants at the hospital to ask their advice.  They suggested the Evenflo classic bottles which are like these except plastic with the clear nipple.  They worked great.  After swearing by Avent with my first, I never imagined the solution to feeding my second would be an "old-fashioned" type bottle.  It works though so I will stick with them	1
B000FCUT68:too_quiet_:quarter_midget_mom	The idea behind this toy is great & ours has lived up to its durability claim.  My husband did not complain about adding songs to it, so it could not have been too bad.  Batteries:  this eats through them like crazy - and we used Duracell.  Volume:  the idea of volume control is good, but the highest volume is way too low.  I can't even hear anything until I get it to the mid-setting.  My 5 yr old son takes his to wrestling matches to listen while he waits his turn, but the background noise of the gym drowns out the sound in his headphones.  We probably should not have bought this until next year, maybe Fisher Price will have improved it by then	0

Her baby brother, now is playing with it too, he is one yr. I recommend to all! Great buy.	1
0882666436:excellent_value_for_money:	Simply, clearly written, the book is a very practical guide for someone new to, but serious about, farming. Concise, yet still comprehensive and fun to read.

B000FH4S6U:pink_camo___can't_find_her.___:michael_r._hinshaw_"doc_hinshaw"	I bought this for my daughter.  She is into pink and camo???   Anyway it is a quality product and the daughter just loves it.  What more is there to say	1
B000FBF400:convenient_and_complete:dirk_devries	Pros: Compact and complete, this portable lighting studio offers flexibility with it's reversible backdrop (gray/blue). I also have used the black back panel for some shots as well. Construction quality is good ( I found one of my cats sleeping on the top panel, which is fabric and held in place with Velcro tabs), sturdy enough for its intended purpose. I like the output of the lights--seems to be a broad spectrum similar to daylight.	1
B000EXOXTC:blue_and_cool:same_old_same_old_"monitress"	I don't like pink so I bought the blue bag.  I had bought a black one, but it was so skimpy I returned it and prayed until this one arrived. I had no trouble with Amazon crediting me for the return, either.  It was so cute!  I'm too old for "cute," but I kept it because I needed a case for my new HP R717.  It is small, yet padded enough to trust that your camera will be cushioned if you drop it.  I have dropped my camera and it was not injured.  It has a little pouch inside to store an extra battery for my camera, not the big AA batteries, but the flat type that come with my R717.  I recommend this little bag, or the pink one, even if you don't like pink...or blue.  They are well cushioned and snug, but not too snug you think they will tear.  The are sturdy and have nice shoulder straps and magnet closures	1
B0009VCBB6:man_gift:ima_goober	I sent this to a male friend of mine. I find men difficult to shop for, however this was an excelelnt choice. It actually does project the time onto the wall or ceiling. According to my friend, the alarm works well and is loud enough. There is a unit that you place outside and it recieves the accurate time from an atomic clock that it then broadasts back to the in house unit. It also acts as a thermometer so you know the outside temp. Your man should be pleased with this	1

182693	Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting	0
240875	Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large.	0
B000CQBXUS:ionic_zone_good_product:k._gardner	I was very suprised at how small the units were (I ordered 2).  But they work great and run very quietly.  The filter is very easy to change.  I have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that I switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money	1

B000E1VYQO:forfeit_a_little_comfort_for_flush_success.....:yogafreedom_"pkfreedom"	This toilet paper will never feel like the cozy stuff that blocks the toilet on a regular basis, but it is a product that feels somewhat better than varieties you find in many public toilets. I am willing to compromise a tiny bit of plush, and save all the hours spent attached to toilet plungers. I do concern myself with any chemicals that are placed into a product that makes it "rapid-dissolve", and will in time, try an environmentaly friendly brand. A great option for family with kids who know no limits for toilet paper usage, and ignore the presence of a plunger	1
568757	First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like "lay lady lay" or "like a rolling stone" to name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite Dylan album and I have all the "classics" like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend this to any Dylan fan	1
277338	Spyro was one of the first games my 5 year old ever played.  It was challenging enough for him without being too frustrating.  There are alot of Xbox games on the market that are for more mature audiences but this one was perfect for a 5 year old. This game was not meant for an adult gaming audience.  I was surprised when I realized this game is no longer in production.  There should be more games for the 5-10 age bracket.  My son loves this game.  He literally wore it out.  I have to find him another copy of Hero's Tail to replace his old one	1
B000F7WW3G:sylvania_dot-it_lights:john_wooters	This is a fine product. The 3 LED bulbs pack a vast amount of illumination. I ordered 4 of them and have no problem lighting up my whole livingroom. I left 1 unit on for over 6 hours and its was still burning brightly when I chose to shut it off. You will not be disappointed with these. Awsome	1
B00005BYQU:a_rhyming_surprise:m._norton_"peggy_n"	As with all the leap frog products, this ones a lot of fun. Packed full of learning surprises. I have always felt that making learning fun and easy cuts down on the fact that it's 'work'. The Birthday Surprise is fun and full of rhyming words, that make little one want to learn. I have a hard time giving any leapfrog products anything but a 5 star rating, because of the quality in all their products.	1
342924	A serious snooze fest.  Of course, if you are a huge Kim Newman fan, you'll be pleased; literally every other story in the book is one.  If you must read this book, check it out from the library; at least that way you won't be wasting your money	0

B0002ZW5WY:a_decent_knife_for_the_price:aaron_olson	They aren't kidding--this thing is razor-sharp.  It needed no tuning up before I used it for the first time.  The handle is balanced so that one feels almost no weight... which is unfortunate, because I like the weight for chopping.  But the hollow-edge design is wonderful--the mushrooms and onions I sliced up were thin as paper, and didn't stick to the blade.  I'd recommend it	1
B000B8J73M:complete_piece_of_junk.:navy_wife_&_mother	I bought this for my pony-obsessed daughter for Christmas, mostly because it was the only way to get the Breezie "Zipzee" (one of the main Breezies in the new movies). Thank goodness I wasn't expecting much out of this toy after reading reviews on the other playsets, because it didn't even last a day! After I assembled the "braiding" handle and my daughter quickly learned how to operate it herself, she came out not an hour later in tears because it had fallen apart. Not the handle you snap on, mind you. That was still firmly attatched. The rest of the mechanism had more or less disintegrated as she used it! Fortunately she gets enough use out of Zipzee and Daffidaisy that it wasn't too much of a loss that I had to throw it away only hours after opening the box.  So, unless you're really after Zipzee or Daffidaisy, don't waste your money on this junky thing that could potentially be a choking hazaard for younger siblings. Horrible!!	0

B000E5DKLW:excellent_midnight_snack.:john_thorne	This is one of my favorite Tasty Bite entres. It is spicy hot, but not at all too hot, with a noticeable "curry" flavor. The addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note (although I could do without the whole chile pod). I take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just-before-bed stomach warmer, but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick, easy, and tasty lunch, far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles. By the way, the combination of pured greens and green peas is a terrific idea. I'd give this five stars if the peas weren't a little too redolent of the can. And, with the free shipping, this is a terrific price.	1
B000EALK8W:buy_for_looks,_not_functionality:megan_ketchum	Personally, I think if you are buying any sort of Razr for its "functionality" you are buying the wrong phone.  I have personally owned numerous LG phones and while they may not be as small, light, and attractive as Motorola phones, LG phones are built to last. However, if you are just looking for a cute phone that is easy to carry in your purse/pocket and to use just as a nice looking phone, this is a great one to own.	1
B000HZLPR0:yuuummmmmmmmmy:s._garbacik_"create_contentment"	Thanks to our purchase of a Keurig, I am a converted coffee drinker. Timothy's German Chocolate Cake is my absolute favorite.

In fact, my hubby and his coworkers all claim this as their number one flavored coffee too. It is scrumptious	1
0967535417:an_important_little_book_about_an_important_subject:	Although this book is only 20 pages long, it contains helpful information about the concept of fair trade.  Americans have so much, and it is hard for us to imagine the degree of poverty in other third-world countries.  Rose Ericson begins to introduce the subject of what fair trade means to these nations.  To us it is only a $1 sometimes, but that $1 in a poor nation can supply food for a day to an entire family.  In our hurry to accumulate material goods, we must be careful to not take advantage of the artisans and producers of these third-world nations.  Fair trade is a concept whose time has come	1

B0000C88FJ:too_sharp:philadelphian	This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave	0

B000EJTEJ0:actually_4.75_stars.....:michelle_"home_workout_dvd_queen"	A little caveat -- this review is actually for the exact same flooring system in the 1'x1' size tiles (which worked out better for me because they are a little more flexible in terms of configuration for a smaller space).	1
249453	I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it	1
60342	This book, Styron's finest, is about redemption.  Heralded by the epigraph from John Donne, the intricately structured tale with its Marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that  it's impossible to put down.  But it's also to Styron's great credit that  the novel's theme, redemption through confrontation with death and  violence, is reflected through its feverish style.  There are not many  books in the postwar era, and none in the United States, that have such a  non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact.  Echoes of the  Greek tragedians (several times evoked in the text) and of Dostoyevski  abound.  Finally, the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate  character, a philosophical Italian small-town cop named Luigi, elevates the  moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers  don't even seem to understand, let alone approach.  It's a shame that  Styron has not received the Nobel Prize yet	1
B000I2WB6G:scares_baby:heather_zahler	This worked great for a couple months.  Then the monkey that moves up and down started making a loud clicking noise.  The gears must be slipping.  My poor baby gets really excited to kick the parrot to make the monkey move, then gets scared at the loud clicking/popping noise and starts crying.  Really sad	0
B0002H0RXQ:hard_to_find_item:vincent_gervasi_"vinman4"	As a guitar and harmonica player who plays out in small clubs it is very hard to find a quality harmonica holder that perfectly holds 10 hole harmonicas .When your specialty is Bob Dylan Neal Young and Donavan covers you have to have a dependable holder that does not slip.This product is perfect for that type of music.I bought two so that I could have one set up in G and the other set up in D to cut down on set up time	1

172308	This magazine is my dream magazine. I subscribed to it immediately after reading a few articles while my parents were shopping at the tractor supply store. It has quite a few useful articles covering everything from animal health to hoof trimming, to special breed information and generators. I think it's a must for anyone who has ever been interested in farming or ranching, or just getting back to the country life	1
B000ETZU8E:waste_of_time_and_money:b._attwood	Sure wish my mother-in-law had read these reviews before giving this to me for Christmas.  Tried to play it once with my parents, who are also big 24 fans, a few nights later and were sorely disappointed. This game was obviously just shoved out the door to feed off the popularity of 24 the show and not to garner any popularity in its own right.	0
B000FGXZBA:best_diapers!!:e._jacob	These are the best diapers I have used. They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection. I HIGHLY recommend these	1
B00081L5VO:great_find!:s._nelms_"s.n."	I have never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this and we are so pleased!  Our 8 month old daughter loves in the independence she can have in her own tub and we feel that she is much safer than in the big tub at this age.  We love how you can hang it up on the shower wall to dry.  Just make sure the suction cup is wet and it won't fall off the wall.  Sizewize, it's basically a perfect fit in our tub, which is slightly tapered from head to toe, but I could see how it would be snug if you have a small rectangular tub.	1
347977	As a fervent admirer of Peter Bart's previous books, The Gross and Who Killed Hollywood, I was extremely disappointed with this one.  I feel he sold out by flacking for Peter Guber, whose exploits were richly detailed in the book "Hit and Run".  There's really nothing new in here, and you'd be well advised to avoid it	0

B0009S9RIO:relax:timothy_s._mcguire	The Ultrasonic Aromatheropy Fountain is really unique.  The sound generated, yet unheard, causes water to spring up from the surface 3-4 inches to provide a fountain-like water sound. At the same time, the frequency of the sound waves create a plesant cool misty fog that slowly boils over the sides and out along the surface it is sitting on. All the while, led lights under the water slowly change seemingly to all colors.  The construction was just a little light duty other than that, Very Nice	1
B000AS7GJU:slippers:a._krueger_"amarie"	I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.	1
B00005T3NH:horses_for_courses:rainmakr	I have no axe to grind with Bose.  I originally bought this speaker for a custom cabinet with almost no room for a center channel set up.  This speaker has an incredibly small footprint.  If space is limited, this is not a bad option.	0
B000EOOZLM:easy_to_use,_not_easy_to_carry.:on_line_shopper	Very convenient to use. However, since the neck band is rigid and does not fold, it is difficult to carry	1
B0006NF894:great_color_and_performance:rebecca_l._paskind	I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate by the end of the as other products have.  Also my coloring is very fair, red hair and blue eyes, even with brown/black mascara I always looked a little off-matched.  The brown in this line is a beautiful color and looks more natural than any I have ever used.  The ease of removal is the icing on the cake	1
331843	Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut.  If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12.  Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised.  I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby.  It's very healthy and low in sugar.  Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	1
B00065HKE8:hilarious,_and_the_cameos_make_it_even_better:kim_paffenroth_"stoker_award_winner_and_author_of_the_new_zombie_novel,_dying_to_live"	It's a funny concept to begin with, and Stiller is hilarious. Then you throw in Rip Torn (probably the best film Judas, among his many credits over the years), and these cameos that are out of control (Shatner, Armstrong, Norris) and you've got a comic classic.	1

B00029U2IY:i_never_take_them_off:sonnsett_radius_"sonn'"	I love, love these earrings. I bought them because I wanted a pair of earrings to wear all of the time. Unless there is something special then I will change for a special occasion. But, these earrings I wear in the shower ---- they are always shinning and they never rust because they are real gold. I received these earrings before the scheduled delivery date	1
B000A0FXIO:love_it:deb_"tchrgr6"	If you are the type that wakes up during the night and has to know the time, this is the clock for you. I absolutely love it. No glasses necessary, and I don't have to crane my neck to find the time. If you're a fanatic about exact time,(I'm not) the atomic feature means you're always on schedule.	1
B000FOEN9U:sturdy_case:kim_a._rawls_"luvs_2_shop"	Got this to protect my Motorola L6 phone.  It fits the phone like a glove.  I also love that it protects the phone screen.  The only complaint is that the case open easily if it's dropped or handled in a rough way.  Clear tape on the seams can easily take care of that.  My toddler has gotten a hold of my phone more than once and dropped it. The case still does not have a chip or crack on it	1
B000EG6F2C:good_size_-_great_quality:karsten_weiss	We purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility, pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it	1

B00005K3OI:a_nice_movie:r._thomas	I enjoyed this movie a lot. Hugh Jackman and Ashley Judd are both very appealing in these roles, and Greg Kinnear does a nice job with his as well - the jerk who's just so charming that you can't resist, even when you know better than to fall for it. Ellen Barkin does fine with her small role but it is weird that she is the one listed first	1
B00005AH85:molechaser_didn't_chase:m._e._connaughton	The product was, as advertised, easy to install and has worked continuously for more than two months since I installed it.  So far, it does not appear to have affected the mole population, however. To be fair, it is possible that my sandy soil is not the ideal medium for this device (instructions indicate that it works best in heavy claylike soil, although the critters have dug quite close to it).  To be really bend-over-backwards fair, I suppose it is possible that my problem is not moles, although the telltale signs are exactly what I understand mole tunnels to look like.	0
B000BV4T9Q:great_bang_for_the_buck!:thomas_w._morales_"deal_dad"	I was debating between this analog model and digital models. I have never heard the digital models to be honest. But this analog model has been great. I can hear minor changes in my daughters breathing and talk to her over it to "buy time" when I am busy and can't get to her immediately. I have had none of the problems with noise and interference some have complained about. If your family is on a tight budget like mine, this is in the best bang for the buck out there today	1
B00004VWM1:great_toy_and_good_food:andrew_blackwell_"old_griller"	I've had much fun using the rotisserie and my first attempts, a turkey and a pork roast, were quite good!  I anticipate excellent results as I gain experience.  One caveat, it doesn't make sense to buy this unless you plan to cook 10-15 lb roasts.  The instruction booklet doesn't provide much in the way of cooking guidance or recipes, but there's lots of both on the internet.  I suspect that using a rotisserie is easier w/a gas grill, but I've been using charcoal for many, many years...and that's that	1
266802	I have to admit that, at first listening, I found some aspects of Ms.Belle's interpretations of these pieces disorienting. However, as I listened to these covers repeatedly, I can now say that I understand better what the vocalist is after. Not that I always agree with her and with George Duke,the arranger/producer, but I agree with their choices and their totally new project and enjoy having had my horizons broadened.	1
B0006ZF9C8:nikon_coolpix_4800_case_and_battery_kit:s._brown	This camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a MUST.  The price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores.  So, I look at it as getting the case for free!	1

470600	This exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space.  This is great for people who do not have alot of room.  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow	1

131087	Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films	0
B000056JEG:leaks:maya's_mom	I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.

B000HAQ8EK:very_pleased:maximum_verbosity_"max"	I've had this camera for a couple of weeks now, it's my 4th digital camera.  I am very happy with the photos I'm able to take, they are truly outstanding.  I'm still learning all of the settings but I'm finding everything to be user-friendly.  I like the way it feels in my hand and I'm pleased with the battery life.  I purchased a 2GB card to replace the one that came with the camera and it's been the perfect size for me.  The video is amazing, I was standing in the upstairs bathroom of our 2 story house and  saw our little one jumping on the trampoline at the far end of our backyard, so I decided to tape it.  Not only was the quality good, the camera picked up the audio, which I never expected!  And I like that you can zoom in or out while you're taping, I wasn't able to do that with my last camera.	1

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.	0

B00000JHXV:terrific_terrence!:christa_dillman	My son is a huge fan of the Thomas & Friends diecast trains and building sets.  Despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys, an important character was missing from his collection: Terrence the Tractor.  Of course, he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his Easter basket.	1
273016	I purchased the Adorama Slinger Bag after first purchasing the Tamrac Velocity 5.  The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).	1

29607	I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration	0

532833	I just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one I bought for my 14 year-old grandson.  For some reason Ziff-Davis marketers think that  full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for PC magazine. (Dec 27, 2005, p 122 if you want to check it out).  Previous issues had partial page ads selling "sex pheremones" which I could almost overlook, but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line.	0
B0009C8J4S:it_is_a_shame:r._easterling	I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition	0
401618	I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals	0

349978	Robin Williams is an AFRS disc jockey in Saigon during the Vietnam War. He is fast-talking, zany, unconventional - and a problem for his superiors. Williams is so much at center stage behind the microphone, doing his imrovisational schtick as only he can, that whatever else the movie is about becomes inconsequential and quickly forgotten. The movie is an exhausting experience to watch, as it must have been for Williams to perform. It's an amazing one-man show, but the picture as a whole left me somewhat empty	1

Keep in mind that all digital interfaces have error correction built into them. Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel? There's no gold inside! So there's no need for oxygen-free, gold tipped, multi sheilded, super mega supreme cables. If you don't believe me, buy this cable and a no-name cheapie. Compare them for yourself -- you will see no difference.	0

If I ever have trouble falling to sleep, I'll just dig out my old "Flatland" book, and I'll probably be fast asleep a few minutes later!  Listening to the A. Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing!  Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing.  I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying.  I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story.  Not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous	0
549942	An old movie, but a good movie.  The end is a sad comment on the society of tomorrow.  Heston and Robertson do a great job of acting.

This author also wrote "What you don't know may be killing you"  These two books are great to accidently leave at a loved ones home.  They are filled with tons of improtant messages and very easy to relate to examples are given that help you understand what actually is happening to your body. My dad has gone from drinking no water to probably half of what he needs but this is a start, he will read more the next time I leave another book by accident...  This author is great!	1
549075	I have been using this rack all summer and still have yet to see it rust as someone mentioned in an earlier review.  The rack is certainly a space saver and comes in handy when you have a lot of grilling do.  I have used it when smoking chicken and ribs in my Weber Kettle, and noticed that the meat may tend to touch when placed in the rack so not all areas may be exposed to the smoke.  If this happens, I may rotate the pieces or just leave it like it is since I'm not entering anything in a competition!  Everything still has the same great taste but the parts that were not exposed to the smoke will have a different color.	1
0375706208:a_survey_of_planet_earth's_history_for_the_layman:d._s._thurlow	Richard Fortney's "Earth" is a survey, in mostly layman's terms, of the geological history of the Earth and how it relates to humankind.  Fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth, selecting a series of locations where the earth's geology is apparent, and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding.	1

Then it doesn't want you to burn WAV onto CD but forces you to invest in MP3 encryption so that you can burn MP3 to CD. The software is full of these horrible twists that Nero has gone from the best burning rom to the worst burning rom by simply making it harder for you to do what you want. I rolled back to Nero 5.5 and had a fully functional and top of the line burning rom again	0

281261	Wedding Crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself, won't enjoy. two womanizers fall in love, one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin, like first off, what does virginity have to do with love? & second, who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin? & then Owen Wilson's character fall in love with Rachel's McAdams character and well, that's the usual predictable romance plot. the problem with this film is it's not that funny. it seems to think it's better then it is. I don't think I hardly laughed during this film. the part about the "supposive" gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course, because it's this kind of film, he ends up being gay and of course, he tries to hit on Vince Vaughn's character in a scene that is beyond creepy. lets just say that "gay" guy is prob one of the worst actors I've seen. & then we get a cameo from Will Ferrell, alot of people I know find this guy "so" funny. but I don't get it. it just wasn't funny to me. u know, I loved the classic, "American Pie" that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy! this film wasn't so much funny as stupid. & for the most part, I'm not going to remember this film in 5 years from now because it's just an average film	0

B000JIMEBG:excelent_for_sniping:william_sullivan	Well, I originally ordered the Black UTG Black Sniper Rifle, but was out of stock at Air-Splat. Well, I could have waited 3-4 weeks or get the Green UTG OD Green Sniper Rifle that I had been thinking about ahead of time. So I sent a reply e-mail and they sent this rifle about 3 days later. The screws, you get some screws, now on the newer versions, the long screw that is supposed to go in the port behind the trigger, is not the long screw. You put in a short screw, well at least for me. I had tried to figure out what was wrong, finally decided to call them and they told me what to do.	1
B000G7YO7M:it's_a_must_have!!!:joanne	I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!	1

B00006JU7S:war_and_boredom:octavius	King Vidor's rather contrived adaptation of Tolstoy's epic riddled with miscast actors, a boring script, and a hurried screenplay.  In short, another one of those 50-year old films that have outlived their audience to slowly sink into Hollywood's vaults of oblivion.	0

B000BK8RHW:soothie_bottles_made_life_so_much_easier!:l._arsenault_"phd_mommy"	My daughter is breastfed, but we introduced a bottle around 3 weeks to ensure that she would take one (with pumped milk and/or formula).  We originally bought Avent bottles and had no problems until all of a sudden at 2-1/2 months she went bonkers!  Refused to drink from the bottle.  Granted we had be a bit lax on giving her bottles (not every day, but at least once per week).  I tried a Dr. Browns and it was the same problem.  And it didn't matter if it was breastmilk, forumula, warm, cold, room-temp, etc.  She just screamed!	1

B000FALAZY:don't_call_it_a_spork:ross_a._brunetti_"rb"	The "traditional" spork never impressed me much. This thing is a spoon with a USEFUL fork on the other end and a serrated knifelike bit that might come in handy here or there. Consider - the spork's obvious habitat is eating typical backpacker food when packing, typical microwaveable foodstuffs at the office, or the stuff in your wide-mouth vacuum bottle at the field jobsite. The Light My Fire Spork fits the bill to perfection	1

B0009KBUA0:not_as_cool_as_stendhal,_but_still_very_good:a._l._thomas	After three years of dragons who walk on all fours, we get a dragon who stands upright.  Seems kind of strange.  Thoron's debut appearance was in the "Fire & Ice" Portal Of Fire set.  He makes another appearance here in The Metal Ages, and he looks a lot meaner here.  Perhaps the rigors of battle are wearing on him.  I bought Stendhal first and was very pleased with him.  I found Thoron to be somewhat disappointing.  He's got some great detail, but he's not as articulated as Stendhal is.  Replacing the standard light-up feature is a dragon roar feature.  Thoron doesn't light up, but he has a variety of growls and roars that are activated by a button on his chest.	1

B0000669AJ:good_toy,_but_beware_for_younger_children!:shannon_l._huff	We bought this toy for our 10 month old daughter, who just love to make noise with anything. She also loves to stick things in her mouth because she's teething. One day, she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth. the metal from one of the bells cut her lip! We let her play with the other ones still, but the one with the bells is put away at least until she's older	0
B000JNS97Y:lego_watch_is_great!:j._l._thistle	My 3 year old son loves this watch.  You can change all of the pieces of the band to different colors and different sizes.  It clicks on easily and doesn't come off -- even on a child's arm.  I am very happy with this watch	1
B00005A3L0:metal_scrapping_son:knightnoise	The Bounty Hunter is an excellent value for the person who loves to scour about an area that was lush with people ie.(company picnic, family reunion).  The Hunter is easy to use and is lightweight. The instructions are clear and concise in describing the difference between a rusty nail and a piece of jewerly. This is my first Bounty Hunter, and I've already recommended it to my friends	1
B0009EYJM2:it's_a_worth_buy:noorain_samat_"busybee"	I got this bracelet for my boyfriend. Initially, I was looking at two different designs, but I'm really interested with this one. I made up my mind to buy this bracelet. When I received it, I'm vary satisfied with it. It's really nice, and the good thing is my boyfriend really like it. It's a worth buy.	1
495755	I LOVE this arm band. I have had it for about 6 months now. You dont have to take your iPOD out of the arm band to charge it or to hook it up to your computer. I also only use my iPOD for the gym, so its nice that this arm band provides great protection (better than iPOD's armbands because it fits snugly and wont scratch it when you put it on) as well as not coming off while working out.	1

256363	Charlotte Church had the most beautiful and captivating voice I ever heard when she debuted.  I purchased all of her albums and played them to death. This CD is horrible!  Her beautiful voice is no more as she makes no attempt to even use it.  Some of the other reviews said this release is the result of her growing up.  Ridiculous!  She could easily have kept the angelic voice as she grew.  This is simply a tragic waste of talent	0
B00004R9VW:noisey_and_kills_squirrels.:kmick	I purchased this item a few weeks ago to mainly kill fly's. It seemed that this wasn't happening as there were fly's still around and no evidence of fly's being killed. At night there would be a lot of flying bugs getting zapped though the noise would make you jump every time. It scared my Labrador Retriever to the extent she would not go outside after dark. The final straw happened when a young squirrel laid dead underneath it with no marks on it at all, I could only figure that it had got zapped. I finally switched it off and hung-up some zip lock bags with water inside, now there are no fly's and no interference with the ecology of our garden	0

1888363339:bawdy_and_superficial:stephen_luby	I enjoy reading sports fiction with my 10 year old son.  The descriptions of this book suggested it addressed important themes which transcended basketball.  However, as I read the book, I found the treatment of those  themes quite superficial.  In addition the book was bawdy.  While it may  accurately reflect locker room mentality,  many readers may not find that  mentality entertaining.  It is not an appropriate book for children	0
B000B8NFHQ:a_huge_disappointment_over_2005_version:paul_kjorlie_"kjorlie_builders"	When converting my 2005 data over to 2006 version it lost all of my time data.  I have to rebuild my datafile just to use the check register now.  Also the new program will not allow me to add a vendor or a customer.  I've had to change names and addresses of obsolete customers and vendors just to add new ones.	0
23803	I didn't have a ton of time to research this flash. I've used it now on several occasions with my Canon 5D and couldn't be happier with it. It's great for shooting portraits.

B0007QCNGG:sizing_is_misleading_-_beware!:kathy_n-v_"buried_in_amazon_boxes"	I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.

B00009XV6M:don't_buy_this_one:	I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product	0

B0000E3J98:cat_lover:s._hudspm_"stealc"	I had bought this heating pad previously for an elderly cat because it did not have automatic shut-off and it works wonderfully.

I can get a heating pad with an automatic shut-off anywhere	0
5088	If you're looking to spend money on this, don't. Having spent my teen years holed up in my bedroom on a Commodore 64 (and being the current fan that I am), I was really excited when I heard about this product. Unfortunately, it stinks. There are a couple of games on this contraption that are real gems, the rest being mediocre at best. The overall bad choice of games isn't my issue with this thing though. It's the CRUMMY JOYSTICK. Control is horrible. The stick is clunky and unresponsive and makes playing a real chore. As someone else pointed out in their review, often it doesn't even respond when pushed in a certain direction. I can't believe it's 2006 yet these companies releasing plug-n-play video game contraptions can't even make a decent joystick! A real letdown	0
B00009N7CK:bad_pictures,_bulky_to_use.:basava_s._kore_"b_kore"	The main reason for buying this camera is to be able to take good pictures from far away. The quality is very poor.

B00091SDN6:poor_quality:m._martin	We had a set of Chicago Cutlery knives for many years and thought they were good quality.  Over time, the wooden handles dried out and the blades didn't sharpen very well.  So we replaced them with this set, but were very disappointed. The blades rust after very brief exposure to water.  We are still using the old ones	0
B0007Q3URC:great_backpack,_but_zipper_gets_caught:joelsindc	Love this backpack, it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well, while protecting the contents well, laptop included.  The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there, and still fit under an airplane seat.  Love the two water holders on the outside. Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner, compass, or whatever. The support is great, you'll barely feel its there, and if you do, just use both straps, and then strap the front for great support. The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens, but thats quite minor.	1
B0009JKI9K:could_you_please,_buy_these_blades?:dimasin	I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!	0

B0001WCX3E:keep_their_attention!!!:numomee	My son got this toy for his first birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and eyes on himself. Great toy	1
B00074H8A4:happy_with_this_mat:tzk	Overall, I'm very happy with this mat.  At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like the mat because it had an unpleasant smell but the smell disappeared within a week or two.  I also, initially, didn't like the fact that the mat was rolled so tightly that it wouldn't lay flat but I solved the problem the same way a previous reviewer did - just turned it over.	1
B000G686MM:wall_mount_mirror:cyndi_h._"autumnraynes"	They had one of these mirrors in a 5 star hotel that my husband and I stayed at and I fell in love with it! I HAD TO HAVE ONE OF MY OWN and thanks to Amazon I was able to find one. This is an EXCELLENT product. My husband installed it easily and I would never be without one again. One side is magnified and my eyebrows have never looked so good, lol, and eyelining is a breeze. Though he would never admit it, my husband uses also (trimming mustash, nose hairs (eewww), shaving, etc.)	1

B0002T3ZKG:good_balance_between_style_and_everyday_functionality:k._yasuhara_"carless_in..."	The Joy is an elegant addition to Lamy's well-designed line of affordable, functional fountain pens.  I'm a big fan of Lamy's Safari for everyday writing and have been using one for years (see separate review).  The Joy is the longer, pointy-ended, calligraphic cousin of the Safari, which is also a plastic fountain pen with windows on the side.  In fact, the caps are interchangeable, and the threading joining the front and back halves of the pen is the same, so I normally write with a Joy nib section screwed into a Safari back end, since I don't like the Joy's long end section for everyday writing and carrying in my bag or pocket.  Aesthetically speaking, I like the long, tapered design of the end, which reminds me of the dip pens I used to use for art and calligraphy.  While this design is fine for a pen that lives on a desk, it's a little too long for carrying around the campus or office.  That being said, I consider this a matter of taste than a problem with the design.	1
254643	I was thrilled to find this set here on Amazon, and buying this set is so much cheaper then buying each volume seperatly. All of the DVD's have some good interviews with the producers, designers, voice actors, and other people associated with the show.  I don't usually like watching interviews/things where people talk a lot, but I love watching those interviews over and over and seeing the steps they took to make this show as good as it was. I totall reccomend it to anyone looking for something a little different	1
B00067MVQ8:wipe_cooker:mama_saint	We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money	0
B000EBMK9O:frogs_licenseplate_frames:c._hoke_"christiansportster"	They arrived well packaged, and in perfect condition. They certainly look cute on my yellow Mazda!

Can't tell the difference between metal and plastic frames	1
B0002XTWDQ:a_good_practice_stick_for_martial_arts_beginners...:peter_zed_"peter"	Damn! I just got the yostick and took it to the local gym and streets to demo some new tricks.  At first I had some doubts about the durability of it but after some heavy duty urban testing, it's still mad tricking.  In other words, I've been trying pretty hard to break it.  For it's price, the yostick is incredible fun.  In an age of pricey video-games, $10.99 is not a high price for something that provides exercise, fun and an introduction to the movement and breathing rhythms of martial arts.  A value-priced training tool, not a toy at all.  The movement required by the yostick will help martial arts beginners have fun while learning precise hand-eye controls.  The ends are fitted with rubber tips making it a joy to trick directly off the ground.  Looking forward to collecting other models. Enjoy It	1
B00062WIUC:great_pot,_hard_to_clean_first_time:frank_yee	This is great heavy duty pot for a very low price.  I've used it so far to cook a pineapple upside down cake on coals and stew.  It worked very well, even without the usual camping legs.  This made in China pot has many minor pits and defects in the cooking surface but cooks well after two rounds of seasoning.	1
B000EHQ7VA:horrible!:jake_samus	I bought this disc hoping for pristine remastered sound and what I got was shrill noise with all the hiss sucked out.

B000BU14C2:great_stroller:txatty	We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement.	1

B000I5T3T6:love_this_high_chair:c_slovak_"mom_of_three_boyz"	I bought this chair for my third child and wish I would've had it for the first two as well. It is easy to assemble, easy to use and easy to clean. I like the recline feature and 5 point strap because my baby could sit/lay in it at a fairly young age. I love the wheels because I could rock him with my foot and talk to him while doing dishes or making dinner.  The one hand release on the tray is a dream for Moms who could use eight hands! My son seems to enjoy the toys, too. I only wish it came with extra trays	1

B0009OAFV6:a_great_little_little_trimmer:penny_dylan_"penny"	I have read reveiws before i bought it that said the trimmer "pinches" or cut people, but i haven't found that to be the case. I wouldn't use it in ultra sensitive places (but i try not to use anything sharp and potentially dangerous near sensitive areas) but it does the trick quite well.  I have really enjoyed it and think it functions really well for a good price.  It also has an attachment to be a regukar shaver (which wasn't advertised when i bought it) but worked well on my legs; not as great as some more expensive  electric leg shavers but is great when you don't have much time.  All in all i suggest buying it.	1
B00012NHAC:sprinkled_goodness:maine_coon_mama_"mcm"	This product is so good for you.  I sprinkle it on my cereal, salads, in yogurt, etx.  A nice nutty flavor.  And the health benefits are outstanding.   I highly recommend this product	1

B000IZ78A2:great_cover_with_one_shortcoming:peter_bratney	This is a great cover to the Sansa MP3 player.

You'd be silly not to purchase this $20 case to protect your $150+ investment.	1
B000BNXKYY:great_all-around_bike_computer.:dave	I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6.0 earlier this week, and I've already put it through a few rides.  I'm upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I've had for a long time.  I've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately, and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great.  I almost bought the Delphi 5.0 a while ago, but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features.	1
B000AM6MM8:the_movie_and_the_dvd:j._donie_"quill_and_lens"	One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:	1

B000G82FWC:i_love_this_wrap!:lucy_tovar_"mom_of_two_bubs"	Since I also have a two year old, it has been so great to have this wrap.  I can go to the park with him and not have to leave the baby in a stoller and I can keep my hands free.  The best part is that my baby falls asleep in the wrap usually within five minutes.  If he is fussy and I don't really know why, it is so easy to put him in here and take the kids for a walk.  The only drawback is that it is a bit comebersome, so I wouldn't use it if I was only going to have it on for a few minutes.  This is such a great way to get the things done that you need to do while still staying close to your baby.  And the wide straps keep it from hurting my back at all	1

67589	first off, let me say for the most part, katamari damacy is an amazing game.  if you don't know the story behind it, well, it wasn't thought up by game designers and that's why it's so original.  the game ideas came from a lady who didn't even like video games, and they used her ideas to make it.  in a world where if you've played one RPG, you've played them all, if you've played one shooter you've played them all, etc. katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air, and i'm glad it's popular.  the music is strangely catchy, it has a great sense of humor, the attention to detail is absolutely astounding (a ton of work must have went into this game), and it's surprisingly very addictive and fun.  in fact, unless you've actually played this game, you won't understand how fun and addictive it is.  show me many games and i can say "i'd like that" or "i wouldn't like that," but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand.  and there's even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend!	1

B00007DWBH:finally!_something_to_make_parents'_lives_easier!:ana_hotaling_"saotomeranchan"	My husband and I have been trying to reduce our years of accumulated clutter, and to our dismay that includes FOUR infant car seats including our brand-new DuoGlider SnugRide infant seat. We were planning on giving one to my mother-in-law, one to my sister-in-law, and keep the third for my husband's car, but then we realized that more than likely, if we brought the baby over to their homes, chances are the baby would already be in his car seat.  We were thrilled to find out that Graco sells a SnugRide car seat base separately! This way, we can bring our son to Grandma's and she can take him for a drive without having to wak him to move him from one seat to another. The extra car seat bases simplify our lives and help us get a little closer to getting rid of all the clutter in the garage, too. Plus, the car seat base works with both the Latch system and with a regular seat belt. A must-have for parents who have more than one car and who have nearby relatives eager to help watch baby	1

B000MCICVU:over_hyped_cd,_but_still_solid:j._lett_"jazz_fan"	Paul Brown is a tremendously talented artist and producer with a wonderful engineering background that allows him to set the standard in smooth jazz for clean production and versatile music. However, content on his latest project, "White Sand" isn't musically expressive as the content heard on his first two solo albums. The artist collaborations on "White Sand" make it tempting to purchase, but you quickly realize Brown's musical wittiness and versatility (Smooth, Latin or R&B) are lacking. Overall it is still a CD worth paying for	0
282209	This is the second time I've bought these for my dog. Although they are not dog treats, my dog loves them. She is very special to me, so I get her the best. This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!	1

B000KPY83K:i_absolutely_adore_this_phone!:robert_d._cordingley_"robocord"	I've had a Treo 650 for a long time.  I wasn't 100% sure I'd want the 680, when it was first announced, but a big nasty scratch on my 650's screen helped me decide to take the plunge.  I'm so glad I did.  The lack of a protruding antenna makes it fit in my pocket much better, the internal slot for the SIM card eliminates my worry that it might get lost, and the covered SD card slot is very welcome, because the darned thing always popped out in my 650.  The only thing lost from the 650 is the reset button.  To reset the 680, you have to take out the battery.  That's not a big deal, since even on the 650, you have to remove the battery cover to get to the reset switch.  What's better on the 650?  The main thing for me is that the cell phone's radio is slightly more sensitive and that it will take 8gb SD cards (SDHC).  I use this phone for everything, since it's also a great Palm organizer.  In addition to that, I've installed a registered version of Pocket Tunes, so it's a very good MP3 player.  It's even compatible with PlaysForSure, if you're into that.  That's why I'm so happy to see the 8gb support.  I also use the phone to play games, like Monopoly and Scrabble, when I'm waiting on line or in a boring meeting.  I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone.	1

B00068TJIU:great_watch,_but_a_little_slow:judge_mental	I bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb. It IS a BIG watch but I am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wrist,but if your not a big guy I woudnt recommend this model. Now onto the timekeeping.When I received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to Seiko for repair, I took it to the local Seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30, well worth the money and now it runs great. This watch is an absolute tank, I wear it every day, it gets banged around quite a bit, and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal.	1

B00006G8GI:if_it's_hardcore_gore_you_want,_look_no_further:b-movie_nightmares_"obsessed_with_cinematic_cheese"	Of course Dead Alive was the better movie.  But I think the comparisons to the Peter Jackson masterpiece are appropriate, due to the fact that there is a high body count, lots of over-the-top splattery deaths, and annoying partygoers that end up as zombie killers, some as zombie lunch.  Apparently there was some footage  cut out for this release.  I'm not sure if that was gore footage or not, but I would think gorehounds would like this one due to the overwhelming amount of onscreen violence.  There is even some non-gore &quot;grossout&quot; humor (vomit-related, etc.) that reminded me of Bad Taste as well as Dead Alive.  Sorry to run the Peter Jackson comparison into the ground, but again the influence is unquestionable.  Don't expect the FX quality of Dead Alive though, this looked lower budget and some scenes were a little too dark to make out everything clearly.  I don't know if this was the way the original film was shot or if it was the print/transfer, but it's a minor distraction.  They did a great job with a relatively small budget.  I echo the other reviewers who would like to see Ittenbach's other films on US (hopefully uncut) DVD release--I've heard Burning Moon is especially crazy	1

583697	I really dislike this software.  I'm the type that likes to customize everything and this program just is not made that way.  First, when you initially select files and folders, your disk choices are "C:" or "ALL".  I have several disks and I want to pick and choose, but this program makes that really difficult.  Then you have to pick a destination where the files will be backed up.  Choose carefully, because you won't be allowed to change it later!  And if you want to do incremental backups, be sure to schedule it before you do the initial save, because you can't do it later.  Basically the entire job, future backups and all, must be defined completly at the beginning and can never be changed without completely starting over.	0

B000AV14J0:horrible_quality,_really_disappointing:sarah_salome_"vintage_grace"	I only had it for a few hours and after that I knew I would be returning it. Its video quality is quite horrible, just better than a videophone and average of a webcam. I should have expected it from something this small and this inexpensive. But honestly, I prepared myself for something at least better than what this camera is. It's quality will not be any better unless your outside, and if you like me and spend the majority of the time hosting parties and wanted something small to capture the fun, this would not do. You basically need spotlights in the room if you want to capture something on film instead of a shadow. This also is a pain for Mac users. It says it's able to import files, and yes it can, but in ASF format. Now you can play it in VLC, but think you'll be able to convert it, think again. It converts just fine, except without audio. I've tried converting the video into several different formats and all of them come out without audio. So, Mac users, pick something else. It is being returned, for certain	0

489997	After reading the many good reviews here, I too bought the Lenmar battery to act as a second battery for my Canon digital camera.  I was totally pleased with the excellent performance as many others have noted.  The only difference I noticed between the Lenmar and OEM battery was that with lengthy continuous shooting with the LCD screen on the camera case got significantly hotter with the Lenmar battery that with the OEM.  This was not a problem until I was shooting on a 101 degree day (with the Lenmar battery in) and suddenly the screen went black.  I could view previously taken pictures (LCD OK) but any new photo I tried to take was black. I read later in the manual the upper operating temperature of the camera is 104 degrees.  Once the camera cooled it worked again for a while, but the black photo problem continued intermittenly for a few weeks then the camera completely stopped taking photos, no matter what.  So, was it the Lenmar battery's extra heat generation pushing the camera over its temperature limit and damaging the circuitry?  Would it have happened if the cooler running OEM battery was installed on the hot day?  I can't say for sure, but if you use a Lenmar battery I would be careful about operating it on a very hot 100 degree day (e.g. use the viewfinder, not the LCD since that generates heat, or turn the camera off a lot to cool down between shots).	0

B00005AQ9E:not_useful:o.s.	I bought this item over a year ago, and it has never served for anything. Once I spotted a deer and turned on the "IR" illuminator, and the deer ran away - not too surprising, it is actually a red light and totally visible for most animals. Better use a flashlight. This is a first-generation nightscope, and has a very small range of utility: If there is a little light, the adapted human eye sees better, and if there is almost no light the device does not see either. 100 bucks is not too much of a waste, but if you are serious about nightvision you should spend about 10 times as much	0

B00004CX8F:an_erotic_vampire_tale!:z_hayes_"myrradine"	This is one of my all-time favorite vampire movies. The cast led by Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat, and Brad Pitt as the vampire Louis does an excellent job of bringing to life Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. The costumes and sets are evocative of the respective eras the vampires live through, and the cinematography is lush and sensual, evoking the decadent lifestyle that Lestat leads...even Kirsten Dunst has a role here as a child vampire, and her famous line "I want some more" has been rendered immortal in movie history. The chemistry between Lestat [Cruise] & Louis [Pitt] is believable and in fact, they give one of their best dramatic performances in this movie. All in all, a cinematic treat	1

B00025A7JM:better_than_a_filet,_quite_possibly_the_most_tender_steak_on_the_planet:c._poole_"steak_lover"	So here's the deal, I'm from Omaha, you can't go two miles without an Omaha Steaks Store.  Here we just call em steaks.  I can go to any butcher shop in Omaha and buy steaks that are just as good if not better than anything Omaha Steaks has to offer for considerably less.  This has always been my stance.  That is until I had these, these are quite simply the best steaks.  Yes, they're expensive, but if you're like my family and go out for steaks on birthday's you can actually save quite a bit by buying these instead.  You won't get a better steak in a restaurant, and my uncle's the head chef in a steak house, I could be stabbed just for saying that.  Cooked rare to medium rare you can literally cut them with your fork, they are more tender and have twice the flavor of any filet I've ever had.  I can't stress to you how good these are.  It's still the only steak I buy from Omaha Steaks, but when you come from the land of steaks that's saying a lot.  Sorry Texas, you may have more cows, but Nebraska Beef is simply better	1

6302041325:a_disappointment...ugh...not_recommended.:john_muller	For those of you interested in seeing a delicate and sensitive portrayal of a S/M relationship, I would highly suggest the Japanese film, "Moonlight Whispers" over "Maitresse." That film is a gentle coming-of-age film with male sub/fem dom theme, while "Maitresse" is a somewhat confused film about an ex-con who stumbles into a dungeon and a (highly unlikely) vanilla relationship with a dominitrix.	0
6304294824:it_left_me_rooting_for_stalin:jonathan_lapin_"fletcher_rabbit"	a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here.	0
B00099YJH2:waste_of_money!:heather_horak	I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it.  Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom.  However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter.  I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam.  Maybe all of the "steam" energy is being used on the night light!  If you have your home's thermostat set under 78 degrees, do not waste your money on this item!  Find something stronger to get you through the winter months	0

B000HTJH58:a_good_granola,_for_once:t._rice	This is a good granola. I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things, and a few nuts tossed in. Nice taste. Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! Makes like so much easier!!	1
175010	Like Callanetics, this DVD concentrates on the slow movements--you really MUST tuck, you really MUST curl up, or else this DVD is ineffective.  Unless you can shut off the phone and close the door on the kids, the amount of concentration this DVD takes for getting one's posture absolutely correct, tucking just right, is not feasible.	1

B000BU7HN2:if_they_made_it_out_of_better_material_it_would_be_perfect...:h._grove_"owling6683"	It's a three-piece roasting rack--two sides and a long "pin" that holds them together. When assembled it has a rounded bottom and tall sides with handles. It's supposed to handle up to a 25 lb turkey, and after using it with a 22 lb turkey I believe that claim. The tall sides and handles make it easy to remove your turkey from your roasting pan, and the wide rounded base holds the turkey nicely up out of the drippings without crushing the rib cage the way angled racks do. In fact, my only beef with the shape was that it was too wide to fit in our Maxam Steel Roaster, which is currently my favorite roasting pan.	1
B00094O3HI:honey,_make_a_bee_line_for_your_tub_with_this_one:kiss_+_makeup_"makeup_junkie"	I received this a a gift for Valentine's Day this year.  It's a nice bubble bath with lots of foam (rather than big, double bubbles).  It's chock full of natural ingredients and no SLS so it's very gentle- even for little ones.  I do however prefer the Deep Steep in the calming lavender chamomile or energizing rosemary mint.	1

B0006Q5OPY:flimsy_-_there_are_better_ones_out_there.:vyshtia	Look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while.  I say it's flimsy because it's so skinny.  Other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts of meat.  This smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more.  I say just get the larger one that's more stable and takes less effort	0

B000E65HKI:great_software:bob_"bob"	This is really good software.  I own CAD software, but it doesn't do what Punch Home Design can do.  It has a bit of a learning curve, but if you take the "step by step" tutorials, you'll find it much easier to learn.  I did a module of the tutorial (there are several), then I saved that drawing as "test" and loaded my own and did the appropriate things to it.  By going back and forth, I got to use the steps being taught several times which made it easier to remember "how" to do that thing.  If you're planning to remodel (that's what I'm doing) or building from scratch, this software will give you a real good idea of what your completed remodel or construction will be like.  It will more than pay for itself by saving you from making a costly mistake	1

B000FJ9WU0:wonderful!:grass_tiger	This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).	1

After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work.  Customer service cites this is a "product upgrade".  A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit.  What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle.  It would barely even unwrap.  Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade.	0

B000CS7A26:cool_and_fun:duncan_deaunutt	I love the Luke Fx lightsaber more than any other one because it is made nicely, it is light, and it has a good glow in the dark that makes it look real. I would not even dream of fighting with it, I would think it would break in a few days of fighting. There is not much to say except it is the best Fx next to the Darth Vader and it looks cool in the dark. It is so bright it lights up a whole room when the lights are off	1

B000E671XY:feedback:l._johnson	These teas (both the raspberry and the blueberry) are priced lower than in the grocery store ($3.49 per individual box), where they are usually a seasonal item. This is frustrating since my husband and I are hooked on them and probably brew and drink a full pitcher per day.  They are the best tasting cold ice teas and great for the antioxidant benefits.  This seller shipped them promptly and they were very well packed.  We will be a repeat buyer for sure.  A+!!!!!!!!!!!	1

B000BY4ZHO:looks_can_be_deceiving:c._honess	I ordered this kettle specifically to avoid heating up water in plastic. However, this  kettle emitted a foul chemical odor that also transferred to the water. I boiled it a few times plus tried the water/vinegar suggestion in the brochure but nothing seemed to help. I decided that I didn't want to take the risk of drinking these unknown chemicals so I'm returning it - it's not worth the risk. I can't figure out if it's coming from the "stainless steel" bulb  (that feels like plastic to me if you tap on it) that covers the heating element or the plastic seal between the glass & the bulb. Plus the lid has a stong odor too & that is plastic covered in "stainless steel"	0

B00006JUK8:disappointing:	I agree with the other reviews. It was a huge disappointment that it didn't heat the water. It is only supposed to maintain the temperature, but after using it for about 20 minutes, it didn't even do that. The manual rollers hurt my feet and it sloshes water around and spills it when you move your feet back and forth. Back to the store indeed	0

289389	This one turned out badly and I hate to say I bought it.  Buggy worse than normal, it is a rough game.  The fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible. The support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions. Too bad. I trusted PC Gamer's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers. Do not buy this game...even when working it is not but a bargain bin game	0

357836	This is another praise for the game, rolled into the other praises. By now, you've read the synopsis by others: your character the Prince (or one of his cousins) rolls an orb (i.e. Katamari), which collects every object in the level. This game works on many levels, it is first and foremost absurd and bewildering. The introductory animations and cut scenes are off-the-wall yet amusing. The incessant rolling is cathartic and addictive, the bonuses involve finding hidden presents and cousins in the level. There are many variations on the rolling theme in the game (roll a sumo wrestler into food, roll a snowball onto a snowman, roll fireflies into a kid's reading light, time trials, etc), but the most satisfying is the original premise of rolling everything and anything into as large a ball as possible. Once you start to consume people, trucks, skyscrapers, ships, clouds, etc, then you feel very powerful.	1
157961	I LOVE this game!  The storyline is wonderful!  I guess if you feel bored with the campaign, just go looking for easter eggs!  But what I LOVE is playing multiplayer!  And someone did bash the multiplayer, but there are TONS of rooms that will kick you out for cussing and/or killing your teammates!   I've had this game for years, and I never get tired of playing online!  Actually...it's kind of addicting...	1

B00005YXWD:limited_access_to_refills_is_very_disappointing:jeri_feaster_"sees_mountains"	I got this for my 6 and 3 year olds.  They both really like it (3 year old needs help remembering which letter goes with which color).  Of course they used up the 8 designs in the first 2 days.  Hasbro.com does carry refill packs, but the website is so bad that it is hard to find them.  Don't bother searching on the word "refill"! There is a form you can print out and then mail in, but this is kind of ridiculous both in waiting and in price.  The form is under replacement parts, but it doesn't even identify what you are buying.  After digging around, I  deduced that it was refill sheets: I think 10 pictures for 6.99 including some bonus pegs?  There is an after-market web site where you can instantly purchase downloadable pictures 13 for 4.95, but you actually print them (including the black background!) on your own printer with your own ink!  Ouch.  Hasbro really disappointed me on this one.  They shuld have included at least 20 pictures with the item and should sell 40 packs replacements online for about 5.00.  Thumbs up to the toy.  Thumbs down to Hasbro.  Also, the light bulb on mine flickers all the time as if it is about to short out	0

B000BN3LXE:worth_it's_weight_in_gold:j._albers	I love my new stroller.  I also have a Graco travel system.  The Graco was just way to big and heavy for me to handle.  I think the Peg steers very well, unlike what some other reviewers have said.  I even set up an obtacle course in the store I bought it at to make sure that I could steer it one handed with my 1yr old in it.  It handled like a dream.  My husband and I went to the mall last weekend and were waiting for an elevator, instead of waiting in the long line, my husband carried our 1yr old, and I carried the stroller up the stairs while it was fully opened.  It was a breeze!  We did the same thing when we left the mall, only this time I collasped the stroller, the carrying handle on it makes it super easy to carry up or down stairs.  It's still winter, so I haven't had much of a chance to test out the sun shade, but hopefully that will work out ok.  I would reccomend this stroller to anyone, infact I've told two of my girlfriends about it, and they have already added it to their gift registry.  You will be happy with this stroller	1

I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.	0
B000L0OZ1Y:great_holiday_gift:erin_"clubpeck"	The Suduko Board Game is the perfect gift for the older kids on your lists.  It is well made and can be played by one or two so they can use it alone or with friends.  Since it is wood it will last a long time whether it is being played by middle schoolers or college kids. Also, I paid $17.99 for this and have not found it anywhere near this price.  It is usually $29.99 to $39.99 for the exact same game	1

B0000AWD92:saving_on_si_subscription:b._nelson_"bruce3404"	Just got this in the mail:  If I allow SI to charge my credit card NOW for a subscription that isn't due to renew until 12/24/2007, they will send me 60 issues for $39.00, or .65 per issue.  I have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time.  So there is a very slight savings, somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my $$$ for an extra 9 months or so (recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of 2%, that interest is worth about 50 cents, so I guess it pushes the per issue rate up to .66)	1
190501	Nine months ago I was hired to help turnaround a once successful business.  From day one I realized that this was a company without focus.  It's one thing to define a problem, another to find a solution.  Haneberg's book was a shot in the arm.  Just one concept -- "Stop Multitasking" -- would have been a major breakthrough for my team.  And, personally, the idea of doing "One Great Thing" has completely revitalized my approach to a huge job.  This book immediately rose to the rank of three or four "must read" titles in my business library.  In the couple of months since I first read it (and I've re-read it a couple of times) our department has moved far away from the reactive mode that drove decisions -- we're nailing deadlines, we're closing more sales, we're thinking more strategically across the board.  In a business and social environment that throws more at us day-by-day, hour-by-hour, this book is even more important than it would have been just a few years ago.  We're all doing more with less -- and this is a book that has helped me see order amid the chaos of conflicting priorities.  If it's true, as Woody Allen says, that 98% of success is showing up, then the other 2% is knowing how to keep your eye on the ball once you get there.  This is the manual for getting your business -- and your life -- where you want it to be	1
B00008PW1F:season_4_is_good_but_not_as_good:mr._know_it_all_;-b_"dr_shock"	With season 4 the series starts to slide a little. I don't think the show is weaker,it's just that how long can you watch a story before it starts to seem like you been there done that already? Look, I love the Godfather one and two,but three is just not as good. The total time it takes to watch the first two Godfather films is a little over 5 hours! That won't even get you through season one of the Sopranos. I hope I speak for everyone out there when I say that as good as the Sopranos is, it will never come closed to the Godfather movies. So I guess it is just starting to get old. I will certainly be watching the finale episodes, I just hope it isn't too big a let down. For those who are interested the DVD set has great transfers, but few interesting extras	1
B000EYNKAY:sulfa_free_dried_fruit_is_fantastic!:a._noey	As an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy, I thought I was limited to naturally dried fruits, which are tasty, but not aesthetically appealing. I'd been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of (at worst) a trip to the emergency room.	1
B0006ZN4WU:powdered_egg_whites:brigitte	These egg whites work great and are economical.  I recently started a diet where I can only eat egg whites.  It seems such a waste to throw out the yolks, not to mention the mess of separating the eggs.  I use these mostly for baking and to add protein when cooking other foods.  Adding the powder has saved me a lot of time preparing the diet foods.  The powdered egg whites do have an "eggy" odor and have a slight aftertaste which is easily overcome by adding vanilla or other extracts when making protein shakes or other sweets	1
B000FGZM0C:yummy_sauce!:fern_"shady_lady"	I recently used it over a few smoked sable fillets - tasty! We also like the Marinara. So versatile, flavorful and convenient.	1
60133	This is my first experience with GPS.  This product makes using it a simple experience with on board instructions.  Viewing the screen on a Laptop as opposed to most of the Portable GPS units is a definite advantage to the user.  I would purchase another immediately if the need arose.	1
B000FKERN6:classic_scent,_but_outdated.:goss1	This is the classic original round stick Old Spice deodorant formula and now I realize that it is really dated.  The formula hasn't changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms.   If you want the great smell of Old Spice then just use the After Shave and Cologne, but stay away from the old stick deodorant.	0
B00008T95O:love_this_clock!:christina_morabito	I love this clock. I wanted a small clock for my bedroom and didn't realize it projected when I bought it (was an impluse purchase when buying a DVD player) I can't live without it now. I am nearsighted so this is great in the dark. I have given four as gifts (that's what I'm buying today) and I find that when I go away it takes me a couple days to get used to the clock not being on my ceiling! I will ALWAYS have a projection clock from now on. I couldn't live without it.	1
B000B13TP6:so_heavy_that_it's_dangerous:lb_"book_lover"	I bought this for my daughter when she was 2. I agree with the other reviewer about the weight of the product. It is so heavy that it can actually hurt a child if it turns over. I still let my daughter play with it but only when she's being supervised around it. And I have to make sure that the toy is not on any type of unstable ground. There are other good shape sorters out there - I wouldn't waste the money on this one because of the potential safety hazard.	0

B0007KKIKK:not_worth_it:shanticat	I have owned this unit for 2 years.  The water seems OK and definitely better than from the tap.  However, every 4 months or so we have to change the filter because we start to have a chlorine taste coming back.  The replacement cartridges are very expensive.  There is a little knob on the faucet that you pull to switch from tap to filter, and this knob recently has broken off.  We cannot seem to access the company's website to get a replacement part.  I am thinking to get a different water filter system altogether.  I would not buy again.  (Also, I have had lots of problems with their water bottles...leakage, breaking, etc.  I won't buy any product from this company again.	0

B00004U2G1:agree_with_everyone_else_on_here:angelo_sellers	I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version	0

0792899636:blue_sky:b_and_l_"a_mom"	This is a terrific movie regarding military life in the '60s.  Jessica Lange truly deserved her Oscar and Tommy Lee is excellent and of course Powers Booth shows his narily side which he protrays so well in so many movies.  I can't even tell you how many times I have seen this movie and I will watch it again and again.	1
345224	This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?	0
B0002808S4:wonderfull:trent_steele_"atos"	I've had this PC remove for 1 year and I have used it everyday that I am home and I have not yet changed the remote batteries.

B0001G6U5M:unfortunate:s._novick_"just_another_american"	When I got this camera for my birthday April 2005 I thought that it was a dream come true. The picture quality was brilliant, it was easy to use. The device was ment to be envied. It took marvelous pictures until within 3 months, July 2005- the LCD screen cracked. The camera had been in a case sitting on a bed with no possibility of misuse or accidental damage. I was never suspiscious of it until I took it to be fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems. Something bad will happen to this camera. Either the sceen will break or the memory card thing. A friend of mine also owned the s410, and her screen broke before mine did.	0
431397	I cancelled my subscription to this magazine 6 months ago with a letter to the editor stating that I loved to see nude woman, but subscribed to learn from the masters about photography.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when I resubscribed after not taking the magazine for years... it used to be a wonderful magazine chock full of insightful articles, lighting techniques, studio setup diagrams, lots of great stuff... I subscribed to a 2 year deal through an online subscriber and asked them to quit sending it after only 6 months and to keep the money.	0

B0002KQNZE:this_dvd_is_not_shaolin_idiot:mikey98223	This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called "Look Out, Officer" that Stephen Chow made in 1990. Shaolin Idiot is not out yet to my knowledge. If you want Stephen Chow's "Look Out, Officer" you should buy this DVD if not, don't.	0
B00074H8A4:lots_of_cushion:jennifer_m._hilton	The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat	1

B000IZDYLO:its_a_piece_of....:sean_bergquist_"seanrules"	Face is made of cheap plastic - it scratched within an hour of putting it on.  Watch had about 20 scratches and dimples after 2 weeks.  I've been wearing a cheap Casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it.  Other problems include- the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly, for example when I put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat; also, the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive, with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch.  Finally, the watch is very well photographed in the ad, and doesn't look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality	0
B00000IOPJ:a_desmond_delight!:tm_"tm"	Though I own alot of Paul Desmond recordings, this one as been in the CD changer for weeks now.  There's great, gentle interplay with Jim Hall, and a total sound that is most enjoyable.  Warm and round notes make this  perfect evening music which I have found pleases most everyone	1
127339	Published in 1986, Dr. Deming "Out of the Crisis" seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in American management mentality. Two main subjects are discussed in the book. The first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations, the second, relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way American management operates. 14 core points are suggested by Dr. Deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods.	1
B000JF20LI:great_elliptical!!:bev	I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be.	1
396463	Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.	0

B0006I8I0K:designed_for_early_australopithecines?:k._browd_"non-melonhead"	I don't have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose. I don't see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all; as I said I don't have a huge melon like Mike Myers's brother in "So I Married an Axe Murderer". The idea/concept is great but...I'll probably return them. Unfortunate because I was really looking forward to using them. People with REALLY big heads, caveat emptor	0
B00016X0GY:just_okay:kc	This grinder was recommended to me, but I have to say I find it frustrating to use.  Juice leaks out the bottom when grinding steamed vegetables or juicy fruit, and grinding some things (e.g., green beans) takes a lot of force.  While the price is fine, the high cost of "shipping and handling" to purchase one unit made me angry; had I noticed before I bought it, I wouldn't have!  Since then I've noticed that this is sold at most local grocery stores	0
B00021D1H6:disappointing_one_from_benefit:ashley	The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that..	0
B000197NXM:bubbles_at_the_avon_library:pat_smith_town_avon	Everyone in the Children's Room at the Avon Library loves the Gazillion Bubble Machine.  It is used frequently during story hours and captures all the chidren's attention.  It's not necessarily educational but is alot of fun	1

B000BYCC1K:purchase_witth_caution...:alli_"alli"	I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.	0
77518	I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16	0

B000FNEVQQ:good_for_lunches_or_storing_food_in_the_fridge:toots	Although the compartments seem small, you can fit lots of food into this bowl. It's divided into about 4 or 5 sections, so you can separate your veggies, meat, etc. The only thing that bummed me out was the ice pack - the frozen gel expanded on the inside and caused the container to break :( So, I use it to store food in the fridge. I have all of the other Fit & Fresh containers and none of the ice packs on those have broken.	1
114440	Micky Dane (Robert Patrick), a paparazzo photographer, is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder. This movie has great action, good acting and really catchy music. Body Shot is another Robert Patrick movie that I've seen multiple times(probably about 12 so far and still counting).  You gotta love Patrick with his blond hair! I AM biased and give this a perfect 5 stars	1
B0000VD03S:galactic_falls_flat:c._barber_"skot_barber"	This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois	0
B000FTHLNU:great_case_unless_you_want_to_attach_it_to_something:steve_azer_"photopassport.com"	Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.	0
B000KTYYYY:mmmm,_cherry!:virginia_allain_"(retired_librarian)"	Regular Hershey's Kisses have always tasted great, but when I tried this flavor, it was an eye-opener.   The cherry flavor in the center makes me think of my Mom's favorite chocolate covered cherries of the 1950s.  Those were always considered too expensive and grown up for us kids to eat.  Now I can have cherry cordial kisses whenever I want.	1
B000HCVR30:amazing!:david_a._dunlap_"david_a._dunlap"	I've been using this since the first beta release, and it has sped up my productivity at work by miles.

After changing my default save setting to 97-2003 I have run into no compatibility problems.	1
B000AXSJDW:good_value:mssue_"mssue"	This cooking set was on sale and even with shipping beat the "best" prices locally.  I gave it to my son as a gift, and he was thrilled to get it.  It included the pots, lids, lifter that were also good quality.  Very nice set.  Good quality/good value	1
B0006IIKRQ:a_holocaust_movie_with_a_difference:z_hayes_"myrradine"	For me, this movie is very different than other Holocaust movies, in that it explores the issue of what happened to Jewish spouses of Aryan women...the story itself is based on a true occurrence, and the movie begins with a wake...the widow is tormented by visions of her past in wartime Berlin & shows disapproval at her daughter's choice of a non-Jewish fiance...the daughter then discovers there is more to her mother's past than she was ever told, and travels to Germany to discover her mother's past...the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences, and basically focusses on the plight of Aryan women in Berlin whose Jewish husbands have been confined in a place called Rosenstrasse...I won't give too much away, but I must say that for a slow-paced movie, it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the Jewish spouses...as for the acting, the characters from the past did an excellent job, their performances were very realistic, and heart-wrenching, especially the actress who plays the main role of Mrs Fabian Fischer, the Aryan wife. In the present day, the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother's past wasn't very convincing, but all in all the story itself makes up for other lacks in the movie, and it is definitely watchable for the unique plot	1

B000NJ5OO0:very_cool_phone:benthere	I got a chance to play with one of these last week. The external speaker is very loud, the controls are easy to use and best of all, it comes with a 1GB card. My only gripe is the slide feels a little loose; I felt like I was always going to open it up by mistake. All in all a killer phone and the MP3 capability/software is a lot better than my KRZR	1

B0007PHO7A:perfect_for_busy_feet!:k._mann_"mallie's_mom"	My daughter loves to kick the blankets off during the night and I was always worried that she would get cold, especially with the very cold weather we have had so far this winter. I saw this and knew it would be perfect for my little kicker girl! She wears it every night now and I know she stays warm throughout the night. The only suggestion I have for anyone thinking of buying this, is to make sure you get the right size and length for your little one. Mine is growing so fast that I will have to get a bigger size soon just because she is getting so long	1

B0008FUD5Y:dont_waste_your_money:s._beck	Loud annoying and entertaining for only a day.  I got this doll because my 3 and 5 year olds, both "had to have it".  They watched it dance for about 30 minutes and that was the extent of the play with this doll.  It isn't a doll that they can use imagination with, snuggle with, or any other type of constructive play.  A Dora video would have been a better choice.  At least their attention would have been captured for the 30 minutes and then they would have watched it again later.  In order to get the skirt to stay on (to change the song she danced to) I had to push VERY hard.  My kids couldn't do it on their own	0

556445	I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list	0

363626	As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.	0
87341	My wife and I, huge fans of `America's Next Top Model' and `Project Runway', were very excited about seeing this film.  Why it took us this long still baffles me, but as of Friday night we had the pleasure of seeing `The Devil Wears Prada' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure.  Now, most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of Meryl Streep, and while she was outstanding, this film is more than just a Meryl painted canvas.  There are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise.	1
185793	Too bad this group supported by Keith Sweat didn't go any further.  I bought it for one song, but the whole CD is great for listening.  Lyrics contain songs about love and such, and I like they way speak about it.  It gives you something to look forward to.	1
B00021E34Q:awesome_sensual_fragrance:j._g._peterson_"dance_music_lover"	I first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester. I fell in love with the sweet, sugary light smell of it and so did my husband. It's perfect for all seasons since it's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you're wearing. I've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet. Now I want to try some of their other fragrances. If they are half as good as this, they win in my book	1
466616	At a recent NYE event, I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance. Its so fast and the colors are vibrant. I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens, it makes me look pretty close. I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in, it pumped out a lot of great pics.	1

B00028DM96:a_pleasure_to_use_--_great_keyboard,_fast_lookups,_compact_size:eric_h._chang	This Sharp electronic dictionary is the perfect pocket companion for those times when you don't have your laptop, or a dictionary handy.  The interface is intuitive and the keyboard is amongst the best I've ever used on this type of device.  Moreover, the access times for Dictionary and Thesaurus lookups are very fast; the "phrase search" function is a little bit slower, but not intolerable.  There are also "crossword puzzle" and "anagram solver" functions that I have not used, but I imagine work fine.  Another positive for this product is the fact that it uses a single AAA battery, not some watch-type cell battery.	1
B0000DJAQU:natrue_made_is_tested_for_purity:teaching3_"e"	I called Nature Made and inquired about their procedures to test their product for mercury. Their Fish oil is USP tested for purity and potency. There isn't any "mercury-free" fish oil, however, NM contains only .01 mcg / g of mercury. Very low level and certainly not toxic. I'm keeping my bottle of it and will take it confidently. FYI: they have a great website that contains all this information	1
B00005B0BL:junk:janet_mendoza	We have had this weather station for a year now an more times then not there are absolutely no readings!  I only get an indoor reading, which I could get from my thermostat!  We have reset it, messed with the sensors, moved it around the house in many locations with a direct site on the outdoor sensors and still no readings.  Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!  Also I called customer service and was on hold for over a hour and still never got a human to talk to for help!  Don't buy this product!!	0

189689	I am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery, or lack thereof, of the magazine subscription I received as a gift of Romantic Homes.  This is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year's subcription for me from Amazon.com for Christmas 2005!  I still haven't received ONE magazine (it's now July 2006).  Amazon assured me three times, over the past year, it was coming, it's now July and I still haven't received the magazine.  I am so disappointed at the lack of customer service.  I urge you to NEVER buy a magazine subscription from Amazon.com.  This has been a horrible experience and I cannot believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter.  I am tired of empty promises from Amazon.com while I am anxiously awaiting my magazine.  Not only have I not received my magazine, the "people" at Amazon have NEVER offered a refund, a renewed subscription, ANYTHING!  I realize it's a measly twenty-something dollars, but this business practice is horrible!  I am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak English and are trying to help me.  Please do better Amazon, this is terrible!  Shame on you!	0
B000H20HU4:family_tree_maker:deb_c	I really enjoy using this program, much better than what was out there 5 - 10 years ago when I last worked on genealogy.  I love the Ancestry.com feature, it is wonderful to go find your grandparents, great-grandparents and even great-great grandparents in the US Census.  I have found out a few things that I didn't know, unfortunately my Mother recently passed away, and I have no one to verify some of it with.  I would suggest that anyone contemplating this program gets it now, and starts working while you still have elders who can help you sort through the information you find.  I also found a family tree out there from someone who only lives a few blocks from where we used to live.  She has traced her family back to the 1500's in Germany...and it appears that they are related to us.  It was strange to go to her website and find a picture of my Great Grandparents headstone.  It was just another branch of the family.  Buy it	1
B000BM8RT8:very_good_portable_compressor:brandon_king	This thing increased the pressure 8 lbs in 20 seconds. You can't beat that in a portable unit. I wish I didn't have to screw the nozzle into the valve stem though	1
497806	Great casting, but poor choice of a stage script to translate to film.  It's so aggravating.  I want to chew my own leg off half way into it.  I know part of it is everyone is a "talker" of a various sort.  They're all a different type of scam artist for this reason in how they sell.  I just don't think it works.  Otherwise talented dialog delivery that comes off totally contrived.  The best actors in this are playing cliches of themselves.  It gives stage to screen adaptations a bad name.  Mamet's an extraordinary genius-writer, but this did not belong on the screen.	0
126836	I got this light before the LED lights started coming out in the retail channel.  Those lights tend to almost be too bright, but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries.  Unfortunately, this light uses 4 AA batteries which makes it fairly hefty.  It alternatively can operate on an AC adapter.  This makes it lighter, but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment.	0
B00005O0SO:why?__what's_the_point?:artist_&_author	There are enough reviews of the main movie story so I don't need to add anything in that regard.  But, what on earth does a lesbian sub-story (in both regards) have to do with the story as a whole?  Nothing.  So, we have another movie that would be great to introduce the whole family to blue-grass music and the Appalachian way of life that, instead, heads for the trash bin	0
B000E1336S:great_scent!:wint	I light this candle every other day in my bedroom because I enjoy this scent so much.  It is a very light scent, but the smell does fill a room quickly.  If you like the Amazing Grace and Pure Grace lines from Philosophy you will like the "Clean Crisp White" candle. The candle is high quality and comes in a very nice container that I didn't want to throw away.  Great for gifts	1
B000KLZ2NY:sound_is_good,_but_they_keep_falling_out_of_my_ears!:raina_brody_"rainab"	I don't know about you folks, but I have small ears.  Though the sound on these ear buds are good, I can't keep the darn things in my ear for more than 30 seconds at a time because they're too big for me, and FORGET about trying to walk and keep them in my ears.  Unfortunately, this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords. Good idea, badly designed for size differences.	0
B0000D9SR8:review:crystal_wright	HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all	0
B000002H15:saved_by_oingo_boingo...:stephen_cabral	I should have reviewed this along with FM. Both were double record hit soundtracks. Both represented youth. Both are excellent time capsules of what radio was playing. One was a bad movie with a great soundtrack and the other was a classic movie with a terrible soundtrack. This is the terrible soundtrack. When the best songs are by Billy Squier and Sammy Hagar you know you're in trouble. Jackson Browne, Joe Walsh, Don Henley are each awful. So were the GO-GO's. Not surprisingly Don Felder and Jimmy Buffet both sucked. I almost fell asleep in route 128 traffic when Graham Nash played. The band that called themselves Poco can't be the same Poco I grew up with. There were some listenable tracks by Timothy B. Schmit, Louise Goffin and Stevie Nicks but then there's Quarterflash. However, amongst all this crap was a gem...the very last song is Goodbye Goodbye by Oingo Boingo. This song rocks and Danny Elfman sounds crazed. Unavailable anywhere else which saves this from the trash	0
B000FHEVZS:the_perfect_reason_to_purchase_this_product:j.storm_"jay_b"	I Bought The Program Reason And The Tutorial DVD Simultaneously So I Really Did Not Have The Opportunity To Play With The Software Before Viewing The DVD. That Being Said I Could Not See Using The Program Effectively Without The DVD. This Was The The First True Piece Of Audio Software I Ever Purchased So To Have A Visual/Audio Aid To Guide Me Step By Step Through The Process Was A Lifesaver. From A Beginners Standpoint The DVD Uses Some Terms That Are Unfamiliar And Kind Of Hard To Grasp. But With Repeated Viewings I Am Able To Make Some Great Music. I Would Recommend This DVD To Anyone Who Has Purchased The Program Reason	1

They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point.	0
0679743898:excellent_introduction_to_artificial_life:philip_m._gennuso_"philscorner"	This book is a quick read and a great introduction to artificial life. It combines something of the science, the personalities and the history of this field. For general readers with some technical sophistication it  affords an opportunity to broaden one's horizons without too much of a  mathematical stretch; for computer scientists who are thinking of their own  research it can give a general idea of some of the accomplishments in the  field and a place to start delving into the original research papers.  Read  it and enjoy the future	1

B000HGONJQ:purfect_makeup!:janice_e._mcnickle	I recently converted to using powder makeup.  I am hooked. I didn't tell anyone I was using it.

I absolutely love it because it is flawless and does not feel "goopy" like liquid foundation	1

I WOULD THIS PHONE TO ANYBODY LOOKING FOR A PREPAID CELL PHONE PLAN. I LOVE IT BECAUSE ONLY FOR A LIMITED TIME YOU GET 300 MINUTES FREE UPON ACTIVATION OF YOUR PHONE. I WOULD ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT IF ANYBODY PURCHASES THIS MOTOROLA ACTIVATE IT ON [...] ITS A WHOLE LOT EASIER THAN CALLING	1
179565	I think this is a pretty good earpiece...  granted, I've only used one other (it was a flimsy little thing that came w/ my friend's Nokia), but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort.  Where my friend's would fall out of my ear, this one (once I got it figured out) never comes loose.    Second, listening to people on my friend's, I would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well, and then they sounded muffled and distorted; but on my Jabra I can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear-- moreso than when I'm not using the earpiece.  Finally, when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece, she sounds distant and muffled; I've had no complaints from the people I'm talking to using the Jabra, and, in fact, my mom said it sounds better when I use the EarBoom than when I don't.	1
B000MAT1I0:great_value:douglas_a._hughey	I highly recommend this bundle for the price.  For less than the cost of an offical Verizon travel charger, you get a travel charger, home charger and a USB cable with driver CD.  Everything works just fine.  The instructions for the USB cable are very lacking, so here are my suggestions:  you can use Windows Media Player to move music over to your phone using the Sync feature, and you can use a free program such as BitPim to do other file transfers between your PC and phone.	1
B000002GI7:boooooooring!:	Don't waste your money.  This album is cheesy, sounds like a million other pop rock songs, and is nothing compared to their earlier work.

0192836366:great_work,_great_translation,_and_great_notes:shaftesbury_iv_"rire_faire_rire-voltaire"	The previous review is clear about the value of this translation.  Knowing a bit of German, I can say that this translation does use shapes instead of forms for Gestalten.  the real value of the work beyond the translation, however, especially for first time readers, is found in the notes made by David Luke.  These notes are helpful for the historical context, allusions to Goethe's personal life and work, and allusions to philosophy, literature, and more ... all essential to understanding the work	1
B00006966I:not_for_my_son.:lisa_j._white_"happy_mom"	I registered for these bottles I am a new mom and thought the variety was great. We used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick. He would struggle with feeding time. He was so gassy and had horrible reflux, that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry. I did have a recommendation to switch to the Dr. Brown bottles which made a huge diffrence. However, he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable, their stage 1 nipples were to small and the stage two were to big. We had gone on a camping trip and I bought the Playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning. I also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the Dr. Brown. So I tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore. So if you like the ventair I think you would like the disposable much better. My sons Dr. wanted to put him on an antacid but I was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age I wanted to see if I could solve the problem, which I have done completly with the Playtex disposable bottles!	0

I tried everything including new seals (that I bought separately).  Eventually we just went out and purchased a new one, because we still like the model.	0
141366	When I found out Francis Collins has written a book about his faith, I ordered it the same day.  After all, we seemed to be following the same path.  I earned a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old.

B0000A4XFF:one_great_chair:f._may	I purchased 2 of these last year.  There are lots of wooden chairs and other furniture out there but few made with a wood anyone can pronounce.  Since I am a woodworker and live in Oregon, I knew ahead of time I would treat this chair so it will retain its color and last in the rain.  Any type of clear wood deck sealer will do and the TRICK to having a lasting chair is to place a small amount of "liquid nails" in each joint before screwing it all together (this chair does require assembly but it is EZ).  If you seal the wood and secure the joints, this chair should last many years.  I still love mine and they look great and because of the liquid nails...there are no creaks or movement whatsoever so I don't have to worry when my "larger" friends sit in them ;-)...buy them now...they are well worth it!!	1
630021592X:easy_come_easy_go_should_be_for_boats_fans.:stephen_verhaeren	If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd	0
225670	This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.	1
B000FKHMGU:these_are_the_best_bags_out_there,_but_they_still_aren't_good_enough:asha_williams	I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense.  I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed.  I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply.  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom.  I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place.  My solution was to use bottles.  They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice	0
140428	This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date. Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear. The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use. Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light. They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price. I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	1

B0006ZP47S:easy_and_fun:mommy_to_ngh	The remote on this car has nice big buttons that are easy for my two year old to use.  One button makes the car go forward and one turns it around.  The third just makes reving engine & squealing tire sounds. Not very realistic but convincing enough for a toddler.  This car has been tossed around and dropped yet still looks and works great.  It is a very durable toy that is simple to use.  It is a great first remote control car.	1
B000000506:back_to_basics:hugh_springer_"the_known_original"	This is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic. Lyrical wizardry was the order of the day, if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic. The production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other. BUY THIS!!!!!!!	1
B00092ZWUW:there_is_no_red,__i_received_white_too.:raymond_lee_"rl"	Amazon is out of RED.  After waiting for 2 months, they shipped a white while the packing list states red.  When contacted, they said that they do not have a red for replacement.  If I want a white I can get it elsewhere for $7.99.  Not I have to go through the trouble of returning it	0
B00005B6ZR:works_good_for_me:l._culp_"linaka3"	I found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn't cause my hair to frizz up and it's easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don't really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my makeup or something else. (I'm a multi-tasker anyway)  I also don't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair.  Overall I like it.	1

B000GK6B4I:wonderful_program,_but_flawed_files...:thudleiber	Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.	0
579971	I got this for my baby girl and both she and I love it!!!  She doesn't slip and it is really comfortable for her.  She really enjoys bathtime.  And, if you follow the way the hammock should be used for the size of your baby...  you will really enjoy it.  I wanted this prior to my baby being born, but I read some of the reviews and I didn't buy it for her.  After the first month of her using another tub, and having trouble with the product, I decided to buy this Aquarium tub that I wanted in the first place.  Caution:  Please use the hammock as directed for your baby's size.  This tub is perfect if you do that!  The reviews that I read about the hammock being too small or the bump in the middle of the tub were laughable when I actually read the directions before use.  Please read the directions.  Both you and your child will appreciate that you did	1

But I've been using this twice a day for two months and I haven't noticed any improvement at all.  Not even a little.  In fact, my eyes might actually look worse.  It has not faded the dark circles, nor has it improved the bags.	0
B0007VB4IY:a_good_product,_but_you_might_do_better.:gasp!	I trained for a marathon and several 10K races using a heart rate monitor. They are very good instruments for training and I recommend them to everyone who wants to lose weight or get in shape. After you've purchased one or two of them, you become a better shopper. I purchased an F-4 for a friend, and I was very, very disappointed in the battery life when I found out how soon the battery in the main unit wore out. Some of the newer heart monitors - Nikon for one- have user replaceable batteries so you can save a lot of money and time replacing batteries after one or two years	0

B000639LHY:the_leg_ripped:kimberly_j._wheeler_"huggies23k"	My daughter wanted a doll that goes in the water last christmas.  I chose this one, and she was so pleased.  THe doll is beautiful.  She did not quite sit the right way in her raft.  Someone needs to hold the raft while the doll is in it, or it will tip. My daugther did not like that we could not just dry the doll off with a towel, so she could take it around the house with her, but that it had to hang and dry.   Still she loved this doll and it was her favorite, until two months later when the material around the leg wripped.  Instead of trying to sew it, I figured it was cheaply made and the rest would rip also, we said goodbye.  This year I am getting her another doll that goes in the bath, but I am getting the Paul Drink and wet doll by corolle.  It is a lot more expensive, but I think it will be worth it.	0
B00006K112:a_definate_don't_for_thick_hair:kelsey_thompson	This straightener is great for thin hair... but not for thick. I myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy. The best hair straighteners out there are about 1&quot; thick or less and they normally have glass plates. So if you have thick hair, spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality	0
B000BPQPXK:poor_user's_instructions:francois	The product promises good results, but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing -- and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated.  Unfortunately, as an average customer, I have only two hands.	0
B000JF5TXO:confused_by_this_'classic':megzi	I am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film: male, born before 1935, or a huge Monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out. Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day	0
B0007NZPYG:had_to_return_it...:mom_of_two	The hair dryer is very heavy.  Also, while I like the yellow design of the dryer itself, the yellow cable makes this look rather like a home improvement tool	0
B000FH2ZIS:mccann's_instant_irish_oatmeal:m._moore	The oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this IS NOT an instant version of McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal, the oatmeal it is famous for.  I thought McCann's only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored.  I would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what I prefer and is much better for you	0

279630	Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of "King Solomons Mines". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic "Prisoner Of Zenda". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution.	0

B0009MFXFQ:performs_adequately:jayb77_"jay"	This shelter met all my expectations.  I would tell anyone to get the optional sand bags if you do not plan to use spikes to secure it.  Being so large, it catches quite a bit of wind and would surely tip over otherwise.  I had mine setup on a raised deck, so the sandbags were a life saver!  Overall this is a high quality item and has already been used a few times and is a much more economical option to renting party tents!  The storage bag is outstanding too... with nice wheels and a handle - it is easy to transport!  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little challenging to setup because it is so large	1

302537	The recipes in this book are often somewhat complex, but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful. Braising does not aways take a long time either.  One of my favorites is Soy-Braised Chicken Thighs with Star Anise and Orange Peel - 40 minutes total	1
418762	I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized.	0
B00068M52W:don't_call_it_chess_if_the_characters_aren't__actual_chess_figures:meredith	I have 7 and 9 year old boys that play chess.  They are also both very computer savy.  I bought this program to buff up their chess playing skills and stategy, but they say they find it boring and don't think it has anything to do with playing chess because the game pieces and boards look nothing like the traditional game pieces.  The characters are very difficult to identify and confusing, they are cartoon renditions dressed up in costumes.  I'd save your money and look for a better chess program or get your child involved in an actual chess club	0

B000F2DNU2:very_good_cracker:d._tyce	I bought these crackers because I love cheese and seeds/nuts and am a low carb dieter.  They are very good and I would have given them 5 stars except I actually liked the crackers without the cheese better.  These are great for an occasional cruncy/crispy treat and I would purchase them again.  They have a less "sweet" taste than the regular crackers and the cheese flavor is mild, not artificial or too salty.  I highly recommend them.	1
B0002OJ6X6:if_it_ain't_broke_-_don't_fix_it!:mary_lincoln_"mollie_ollie"	I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?	0

483548	This game, while simple in it's storyline shows us the depth and power of Disney matched with Square/Enix.  First Square and Enix merge, effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest RPG's of all time (Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy).  Now, we have the perfect pairing of wit, humor, heart and pure Square story.  Based in many of the worlds from Disney Legends, your character Sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing.  The chains you can get going in Sora's attacks are amazing.  The extra battles in the sky over London and in the Hercules Arena are outstanding.  To learn this battle style, you must have wits of steel and thumbs of Orchaleum.	1

B000AQK1DK:enjoyable_foot_bath_-_have_to_work_for_the_pedicure:m._billa	This is a great sized foot bath.  I pour hot water in it, sit back and relax.  It doesn't keep the water warm, but if I start off with really hot water it stays warm until I'm ready to get out.  Using the pedicure attachements is hard work though- I just assume use a hand-held brush.  The bubble feature is too loud to use while watching TV.  Still, for the price, I like this foot bath. I've even given it as a gift	1

48524	I love this magazine, the images are crisp, the writing consistantly to quality and the photography is always fabulous.  Let's face it when a magazine coins a phrase, you know it's good.  I have read GQ for several years and have found it consistantly good, though I must confess the only part that I consider must read every month is Style Guy, I don't always agree with him, but I love the questions, you really wonder if these people have ever picked up the magazine the are writing to..one never knows.  The clothes they feature are usually top shelf, uh with top shelf prices as well..I mean a $2000 pair of alligator lofers..you gotta love it.  If you have any interest in the latest styles and some great writing as well, then I highly recommend this book to you, though frankly I can't imagine anyone reading this that does not already have an opinion of this iconic magazine..but if you don't then by all means pick it up and form your own opinion..it's worth the effort	1

406066	Our library has just finished its magazine usage count, and to my surprise the American Spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits, measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues. And yet our patronage here is very conservative. Perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all, or maybe, as a couple of reviewers suggested, with Bill Clinton out of office, it no longer has the same appeal.	0
1558745629:what_was_country_about_the_majority_of_the_stories????:	A book full of heartwarming stories from country stars, singers, writers,  and listeners, or so the back of the book said.

565053	This 1971 black comedy is still a stitch, even if it doesn't feel as audacious as I'm sure it once did. Directed by the maverick Hal Ashby, it is the epitome of all opposites-attract love stories as a twenty-year old depressive connects with a 79-year old life-loving woman. They actually bond over their mutual interest in death, as they keep showing up at the same funerals. However, the root of their respective interests couldn't be more different - Maude shows up to reconfirm how lucky she feels to be alive, while the hearse-driving Harold simply likes the morbidity of it all.	1

B000ITVRQY:amazing_value:omar_nazif	Going from charging my phone a couple times a day to charging it once every couple days has definitely changed by opinion of my A900, making it less high-maintenance and allowing me to do some web browsing, headset using, and general multimedia mayhem without the constant paranoid fears that this fooling around will cost me when the OEM battery decides to die at the most inopportune time.  Quite a cheap price for the freedom and peace of mind.  It's been 12 hours and the thing has yet to change from 3 bars.  What!?  Aside from the piddling cost of this battery (which is about double the tax you'd pay on a battery at a Sprint dealership), there is the tax of the bulge it creates on its backside.  To me, this is not insignificant, but is ignorable, as it doesn't detract from the aesthetics of the phone and it provides a way to grip it when dialing, talking, or using the buttons	1
B00021AUVG:like_nothing_else!:emma_callahan_"product_junky!"	This perfume isn't comparible to anything - finally a totally unique scent! It's sweet and sexy, and the scent changes with you. I'm addicted to it. So are the men! ;	1
B000BPCWEQ:dsc_t9:jeffrey_j._marcus_"jeff"	I've owned the T9 now for just about 3 weeks.  I purchased it after some extensive research.  Of course you never really know a product until you've had it awhile.  Here's my thumb nail opinion.	1
B000EMM97Q:clumpy...:l._el-zein_"lmez"	The mix was a little lumpy...had some hard chunks that would NOT dissolve, they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter. The mix was not expired, it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage. Still came out o.k. and tasted great.	1

B000KPY83K:4_phones_and_counting...:stacy-michelle_reid_"coffee_girl"	I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular.  I've gone through 4 phones - the same thing over and over.  Never did they (or I) put 2 and 2 together to see that it was the SD card (although right now it's working, and the card is not in it - go figure!).  So, I guess the options are not download things, but have the phone work, or download things onto my SD card, and not have a phone	0
B0000DGBI2:very_painful_-_no_noticeable_improvement:a._antunez_"amarie"	I read the directions and followed them to a T. The pain was just too intense (on my gums - they started to bleed!). I tried to adjust the "trays" every which way, but there was no way not to get the gel on my gums. After all the time, trouble and pain, I didn't see ANY improvement in whiteness. I have used the older Crest Whitestrips, and liked them much better.	0
B000077DD4:_don't_buy_rosetta_stone:margot_s._kernan_"movie_starr"	The first order I received for Italian 1 and 2  had defective disks, which were not replaced by the manufacturer when I called their customer service.  When I re-submitted my complaint to Amazon, they immediately sent me a replacement of the whole set. However, these disks also are very slow to load on my new MacPro laptop, and quit at times. I am not able to recommend Rosetta Stone	0
B000JWIZH4:great_phone:murat_yilmaz_"murat_yilmaz"	This is really cool phone and has many features. Unfortunately, you could not use some of these features in the U.S. One thing I do not understand why unlocked phones are so expensive in the US and retailers charge much more price. Its price is just 429.99 on the Nokia's web page.	1
B000BFO7M6:very_surprised_that_i_love_this_scent!:s._e._smith	I am in my mid 30's.  I am not a Britney fan at all.  I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it.  Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent.  My husband and I are both picky about perfume.  I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit.  Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it.  I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache.  I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone	1

B000J0T6Q0:not_to_be_trusted...:dustin_deckard	When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.	0

86581	We bought this clock radio, got it home, set it up, realized that it didn't have battery back up, called Sony only to find out that they do not find it necessary to put that feature on their alarm clocks....how bizarre!!  They do not carry battery back up on any of their new models according to their representative at the customer service center!  Boxed it up and it's going right back where it came from.  If it's okay not to have battery back up, it might deserve a chance, however, what's the use in having an alarm clock if you can't trust that it will indeed wake you up	0

I wish it had a snap or something so it'd stay closed instead of only folding...	1
B000G1785S:works_great_on_your_head_as_well!:adam_b._king	Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually bought this shaver to use on my head. I have been shaving my head for the past 2 years and during that time have used a Panasonic ES8066. It was a fine product (able to be used either wet or dry, unlike the Braun), but I had no idea that upgrading to the Braun 8985 would make such a difference. I shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the Panasonic! No longer did I need to keep going over the same spot again and again. The Braun took off the hair in one or two passes, cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation. I can't believe I wasted two years shaving with my old shaver! I know Panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers, and I can't comment on its new Vortex shaver, but I know I won't be returning my new Braun any time soon	1
B000056W4W:clean_+_pure_feeding:teeny_beany_"teeny_beany"	I cringe at the idea that I fed my baby from heated up polycarbonate bottles. I might not be able to breastfeed my baby, but with my new glass bottles, at least I know that I am feeding her the purest form of formula I can possibly give. She hated the taste of the latex rubber nipples so I bought some silicone ones and was successful.	1

B000EBC4PY:get_what_you_pay_for:t._morgan	I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.	0
079284551X:city_of_angels_was_way_better!:jay_murray_"2_cents"	Save your $3.50 DVD rental fee. If you're looking for a movie that will make you feel like City of Angels made you feel, look elsewhere! Sorry, my vote is for Hollywood. The director of Wings admits that there was no script before shooting began. The extras that came with the Wings DVD, interviews and info on Berlin, were more entertaining than the movie.	0

415680	There are issues regarding hardware incompatibility w/ specific components of the Toshiba Satellite M45-S355. The hardware incompatibility issues w/ the DVD-RAM drive, the GL910 chipset, and the SoundMax integrated audio drivers are known to both Microsoft Technical Service personnel and their counterparts at Toshiba. I spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies (both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as "English"). The Amazon representative with whom I spoke was in New Delhi. I ultimately figured out (on my own) which Toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded (again consuming hours of download time with a 56K modem), and I used an Iomega CD-Rom USB external drive to load the software after about six extremely aggravating hours. I was able to avoid similar pitfalls when attempting to install Small Business Accounting 2006. Don't buy these products unless you absolutely MUST. Microsoft's "technical service" is a euphemism more aptly meaning "technically useless". There is nothing technically professional about the additional capabilities of Microsoft XP Professional. I should also mention that both the Toshiba laptop and the software were purchased from Amazon	0
B0009J1EUC:very_poor_light_output:d._marchiando	I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine.	0
B000ITVRQY:samsung_mm-a900_extended_battery_w/door_review:g._middleton_"kingpindoe"	The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying	1

486137	Most people I know who have viewed this film fall into two categories. On one side there are those who hate it, while on the other are those who like it. I am of the latter group. This is not a comedy, although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh, it appears to be a comedy. However, make no mistake about it, this brilliant film is more than that. It is a biting satire of a very dark side of life. One I wouldn't wish on anyone.	1
B0002VJKSU:does_not_fit_the_i530:k._apgar_"book_and_music_fiend"	Just as a note to any Motorola i530 users, this belt clip does not fit the phone.  The wraparound clips at the bottom of the holster are too large for the phone and the thumbclip at the top of the holster does not reach far enough over the top of the phone to snap into the lock groove.  Do not bother with it.  This item may be mislabeled and actually be compatible with another Motorola phone, but I have no way to find out as I only own an i530	0

B000GZ0AFY:bad_battery_bad_phone:s._bonewald	ahhh I see your battery is dying.  Be forewarned.  I'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  I mean really how old is your phone?  Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  The Li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)	0
B0001XGNQ6:i_never_knew_shaving_could_be_so_satisfying:richard_reynolds_"swnovice"	I recently realized that while my wife spends hundreds on high quality skin care products for us, I was still using throw away razors.  I recently received a Fusion razor and loved that, until I went to replace the blades.  $4+ a piece, and they last no longer than any other blade.  So, I got online and researched shaving and what I learned was that, though there have been advances in shaving technology, nothing has been improved, only made more expensive.  I learned my dad was right; all it takes for a great shave is a good safety razor, a decent brush, shaving soap and a mug.	1
B000KBNDGW:wellies_par_excellence:diva_designed	These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking.	1
477445	This magazine is all puff-- if you're looking for honest and insightful reviews, this is not your read.  However, if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them, this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue	0

B00004Z5PD:awkward_shape,_avoid_it._:michael_davis	The shape conforms perfectly to the designer's hands, but unless you share the same DNA, I'd avoid this product. I've used many of these over the years and this is the only one I struggled with. Constantly shifting it to get it's high and low points in a place that was tolerable. I finally reversed it, pointing it towards me and it worked a little better. This just needs to be a simple pad. Instead, they've overdesigned it as a gimmick.	0
320125	I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.	0
B0009OUFKC:one_more_piece_of_junk.:.	Yes, you'll feel your muscles contracting. If they were really contracting to a  degree worthy of being called exercise, the contractions would scare the heck out of you: You'd either feel like your whole core was paralyzed or you'd be going into an spastic, involuntary crunch. Don't worry, that won't happen. The machine isn't strong enough. (Try this: Tense up your abs..more..a little more...relax and do it again a few times, for a minute or so...thats already WAY more exercise than you'll get from the 'Ab Sonic'.) If you're a therapy patient who has a poor muscular awareness, perhaps this will help you begin to get enough feeling back to move on to a real exercise program. If your spinal cord is severed, this may be all you can do to get a little musuclar stimulation...fine. This is not exercise. It may 'remind' you to tense your abs in order to not look like a fat slob, but why not just remind -yourself-? It's not powerful enough to do do any real strengthening, and even if it was, it by-passes the most important part of your  workout: the will. You  aren't learning the effort of tensing the muscles, or tolerating greater stress, you're just electronically agitating the muscles. In the end, this has ZERO effect on strength, muscular development, work tolerance, and function. Are you in therapy? No? Then why are you trying -so hard- to avoid -moving- your body	0
241429	This disc set contains two spectacular games, Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger. Both of the games are wonderful. I have played every version of Final Fantasy IV, the Japanese version fan translated, the English version on the SNES and the remade version on the PSX. I loved all three versions. Final Fantasy IV's storyline is great. The plot starts right away. The storylien is gripping and it makes you feel a lot of symphathy for the characters. All of the characters have well developed personalities and this game has a quest for redemotion It shows that people can change. When Cecil is in a situation where he must choose honor and dignity versus the life he knew- he makes a decision that will change his life forever. He goes against everything he learned to do the right thing, what his conscience tells him and embarks on a quest for redemption. When he becomes a new person, the other characters are developed, and his relationship with his lover and his companions are delved into. The storyline is great- a wonderful love story and a great tale	1
228355	The flight into New York had been a long one; but I was gently revived when Kirsten Dunst met me at the airport.  She was to be my escort that night at the Lincoln Center where the President would present me the Distinguished Writer's Cross-the highest award this nation can bestow on an author.

388948	Being a Starsky and Hutch fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to playing this. The graphics are &quot;cartoon&quot; horrible and the need for &quot;VR&quot; points becomes annoying after awhile. The bad guys are like something from a Chinese Kung Fu movie, you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them...and that's with playing with a PS2 gun (I can't imagine shooting with a controller) which makes you lose the mission because you are down on &quot;VR&quot; points. The dialog gets annoying too and you can't skip hearing it either	0
336931	Do you know why this double CD is often in the bargain basement?  SImply because it is an inferior product.  For some very odd reason, the compiler at the record company decided to put 13 live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember.  For all we know, it may have been a copyright problem. I bought this for my Dad about 5 years ago, but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it. The live recordings on this CD are dismal and not related to the awesome "Hot August Night".	0
386494	It is a fun "first person", shooter game. The graphics are decent and the story line's ok. The game's play time is about 15 - 20 hours	1
B000HKYOQ4:...when_i_was_very_small...:feeniks	This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).	1
B0007M3PKI:_a_good_camera_for_the_money._:collageart_"glenda"	This is a very good camera for the price range. I have always had good luck with Sony products, unlike some of the reviewers here. The resolution of the viewer window and the image quality itself is more than what I would expect from a camera in this price range.... it's pretty decent. For what most people use DV cams for, this is camera doesn't suck at all.	1
B000BAUSO2:it_worked_for_me!!:janice_m._mahon	I lost six pounds in eleven days.  I started out taking one-half pill in the morning and one-half in the afternoon.  I was wary of any reaction.  I now take one pill in the morning and one in the afternoon.  That's enough for me.  I have a lot more energy and am motivated to exercise.  No side effects whatsoever.  My problem was the munchies at night watching TV -- and that craving is gone.  I highly recommend this product	1
B000K2PA3A:before_you_buy,_read_this!:gadgester	Unlike years past, H&R Block (founded by a guy named Bloch) decided to charge $16 for each e-file, Federal or state.  Only one version, "Premium Federal+State+E-file" includes a "free" Federal e-file and state e-file; but that version costs $70, so there's no free lunch at all.  Seriously, $16 is a lot to pay for e-filing.  There are websites that give you completely free e-filing; my favorite is TaxAct (at taxactonline dot com).  With TaxAct, you get the complete Federal plus state package for $7.95, which includes e-filing.  Or you can use their standard package to prepare Federal and e-file for free, with *NO* income restriction!	0

Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers.

It's really not bad at all, although the plastic hair doesn't allow his head to move very much. When I'm writing, and I get to a point where I need to back off a bit, I pick him up and change the pose, or threaten my daughter with the masamune, or she and I set him up for a couple of humourous pics. It's great.	1
0613783808:a_child_&amp;_adult_inspiration:marcia	I first heard this story as a part of a sermon given to a congregation of mixed ages.  The children were enthralled with the illustrations (as were many adults) but the &quot;message&quot; was deeply felt by the &quot;older&quot; child in all of us there.  It is the message that no one really knows how much influence they have.  Mole was just doing something that really intrigued and interested him, and brought him pleasure.  He wished that he could influence others, but never knew what his music did for the world.  Maybe this is true for each of us as we pursue what we really have a passion for.  The message is true for children and adults alike. I will share this with my young 8 year old violinist friend, and from the pulpit. Thank you, David McPhail	1

B000NNZT1Y:the_do-it-all_phone!:pcdo	Well I read through just about every review prior to purchasing this phone and was almost thinking twice about it after reading some of the reviews here, but I decided to take the plunge and go for it.  Well I'm glad I did.  All I can say is this phone has been a pleasure to use from the get-go.  It has its flaws but what phone doesn't?  The question is whether you're going go flip out over an alarm clock or volume strip or is it a trivial issue for you.  Most of the gripes others have had just seem little to me.  Let's talk about the pros and cons:	1

B00074TAWI:nice_idea_poorly_made.:the_mountain_man	I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon.	0

B0007LXKQS:weighed_my_hair_down_:g._graham_"g"	I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck	0

B00005JS5C:pretty_darn_close:bunson_honeydew	My fiance (now wife) and I have been looking for a workable solution for the hair down under.  She has tried waxing - too painful - and shaving would cause a lot of bumps and irritation, even with the Shick Intutition.  Her pubic region was basically living on Neosporen, Bikini Zone, and Gold Bond (not together and not in any particular order).  We also tried scissors, but that was hard to negotiate, if you will, in the more intimate of areas.  At this point she was seriously thinking laser hair removal, but wasn't ready to pony up the $$ and commit to an irrevocable decision.  Although, based on the other posts here and accepted fashion trends, I highly doubt that an "au natural massive overgrowth" will be in style.	1

B000BNJIE0:workes_sometimes...:curtis_empson	Most of the other reviews for this toy are correct. when it works my kids love it. and it is pretty cool when it works. but it doesn't work very well very often. you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly. and even then the car crashes a lot. we have found one car (out of about 200) that works somewhat well. but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so, read the reviews and make your own judgements. personally, i'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it. my kids will still play with and enjoy it, but not as much as they would if it worked better	0

I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it.  It all went downhill from there.  I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly.  The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective.  I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind).  He couldn't read the questions on the tv.  I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated.  Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all!  As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.  One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri.  Whatever.  Game sucks.  Costs too much.  Stay away	0

B000KMHV8W:nice_ninja_weapon:neil_r._meislin	It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.	1

B000J103TS:scrappy_man_you_let_us_down_:shanti_g.	First of all let me clearly state that im from Atlanta and I am a diehard fan of Lil Scrappy and that is why it breaks my heart to tell you that this CD is garbage. Besides Money in the Bank there are no other standout cuts and it is a shame because the underground mixtape he dropped with DJ Don Cannon early last year was on fire, He and Cannon delivered all new tracks and there were all on point, that was of course before 50's influence which brings us to our problem. The influence of Curtis Jackson A.K.A 50 Cent is very clear on this album. I like 50 but he knows little of the way we make records down south. If the G-Unit boss would have just stayed out he way and let Scrappy pick and choose his own tracks, verses etc. everything may have been fine. The guy is a control freak and as a result nobody in the "A" is pumping this and it is a shame because when Scrappy is on point the boy is unstoppable. This CD is garbage plain and simple and 50's influence is going to put the the crown prince of the south's career in serious jerpody unless he quickly wise's up. This is an honest review from a fan that has been down since day one.I have bought all the mixtapes and everything else he's dropped but, im telling you If you the consumer buy this Cd you will regret it and to Scrappy ditch the G Unit do what's in your heart and get back to business.	0
B00029TCTE:not_worth_it!:ria_g	I ordered this online and got the pieces in the mail.  3 pieces were damaged so we called the manufacturer for replacements.  They said it would take 2 to 3 weeks.  Its been 3 weeks, when I called again they said it would take another 2 weeks.  How hard is it to get replacements?? My baby is due anytime now and the changing table is still in pieces.  Would like to get the nursery done, preferrably before my child goes to college.  We purposely ordered it early to give us time, but apparently that wasnt enough.  I tell you its very frustrating and so not worth it.	0

I looked everywhere on-line for a replacement part, but could not find anything.  Finally, I called Hozelock in New York and they sent me a replacement part.  They charged me about $6 for shipping a part that cost about $3.  The system can't be used with a regular sprayer or a regular sprinkler.  Also, it is hard to reel the hose in.  Overall, I don't think this item is worth the cost.  If you need to call Hozelock their number is 1-800-297-7461	0

6304542887:another_failure_with_dolph_lundgren:michael_bolts	Dolph Lundgren (Universal Soldier, Blackjack) plays a man who is hired to take out a primary target and helping him is his old partner, Gina Bellman. Soon things heat up as the two security guards working at the building they are at start to get fiesty and one of them takes drugs and sees spiders and stuff. The 2 are also in a heated romance and get caught in a deadly cat and mouse game of double cross as the agency they are working for want them dead. Another Dolph Lundgren stinker vehicle though Lundgren can't act if his life depended on it. He couldnt pull of He-Man and The Punisher, he can't pull off anything else. Gina Bellman is hot but her acting is horrible as well as the rest of the cast. There's nothing like being hired to kill people and then have sex. Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander). Bottom line is this actioner is a borefest	0
125642	I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander.

B00068O7GO:i_love_this_product!!!!:k._bingham	I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.	1

105254	I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.  I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others.  They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it.  Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price.  So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members.	0

122227	First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.	0

I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!

0940795205:is_the_universe_in_'tune'?:steve_s._jones	People have been trying for years to prove that the founding cause of the Universe is natural occuring harmonies. These theories are usually the occult disguising itself as science. If these theories are correct there needs to be a 'fundamental' frequency (a demiurge style 'god of harmony') to begin the resonance. No such thing exists - see Scientific American, August 2005 'Is the Universe Out of a Tune?	0

B00004ZES4:you_don't_want_this_version!:"thai79"	When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting &quot;customers&quot;(read victims)	0
B0000C88FK:magnifica_afeitadora:rafael_quero_"querora"	Yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa, muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua. Le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae. Si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad.

B000068YIJ:it_helps_get_me_through_the_tough_days...:jill_c._schwartz	I have been suffering from depression since I was 15 years old. My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else	1

B000JG9SY4:not_perfect,_but_good_for_the_price:j._prevas	The bike arrived in fine condition, no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported.  It was really easy to assemble.  Once I had assembled it I tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around - as if the gears were scraping against something.  So, I undid all the screws (a pain) and opened the plastic-enclosed base.  There was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way, but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging, and would interfere with the gears.  So I taped it to the side, closed the plastic up, and that was that.	1

B000324Y8E:product_sucks:perry	I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen.  Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes it impossible to close with one hand.

B000A2LI6I:too_thin_to_keep_you_warm,_too_bulky_to_haul_around.:m._lee_"tech_geek"	I purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the 12-hour flight to Japan.  However, it was way too thin to keep her warm.  After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this	0

B000077DD3:excellent_but_over_priced:john_f._wright	Overall I would highly recommend the Rosetta Stone software even though it's a bit over priced and certainly insufficient as your primary learning method.  Rosetta Stone *combined* with Pimsleur is a great method for languages that are similar to your native language.  The disks are copy protected and that is a serious drawback as you need the CD in the drive any time you are going to use it and you can't use a backup copy for safety.	1

B000005S2Y:essential_existential.....:graham	I bought this album when it was first released in the 70's. Heaven and Hell was hot item and passed through my senior school from ear to ear amongst 'those kids in the know' in much the same way that a joint would these days. The movements build on a theme throughout the work and reflect the care that went into creating some classical overtures. Only later in life could I get the similarities to Carl Orf and Khachaturian. This is a real masterpiece and a snapshot in time of when Prog really was prog. Listen to it in full and then catalogue alongside Camel's 'The Snow Goose', the original 'Tubular Bells' by MIke Oldfield, 'Brain Salad Surgery' by ELP and finally ' Snowflakes are dancing' by Tomita.  Please dont compare this work to the keybored pop, I chose my spelling, of the 1980's If you enjoy Vangelis, as I do, you might also want to listen to the compositions of Ennio Morricone, he is the man who wrote that great music that follows Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns.	1

0812973763:"days_of_our_lives"_for_the_starbucks_crowd:jody_tresidder_"jody"	Other reviewers have taken pains to outline the "plot" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. Suffice it to say author Kathryn Harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that "more is better" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused New York shrink. This reader was aching for the hero, Will, to book himself onto Jerry Springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from Ms Harrison like "It's just...it's...What is it? Will doesn't have a word for what he feels." (Perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. In any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.)	0
B0007CXQQ6:assault_on_the_environment!:john_j._meyer	This hamper is okay, but Amazon was very irresposible in how they shipped it.  I ordered four, and all four shipped the same day from the same warehouse.  How did they arrive?  In four giant shipping boxes; each one contained one hamper and about 3 cubic feet of air filled plastic bags!  It took me 20 minutes just to break down the boxes and the plastic bags.  I live in the city where recycling and trash space is scarce, and this really an insult to me and to the environment.  There is nothing fragile about a compressed laundry hamper.  According to the packing list, the shipping cost on each was $6, which means that due to Supersaver, Amazon was skinning their shareholders to the tune of $5 per hamper.  Amazon, shame on you, you could have shipped all four in a large envelope!	0

Zinc Oxide protects a broader range of these rays than does Parsol 1789.	1

B0002E2GQU:full_vs._medium_roast_espresso_beans:petur_o._jonsson	Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for  Italian espresso. Illy roasts their beans for a longer time, but at a lower temperature, than Lavazza. As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker, and according to some people more robust, than Illy is.	1

0534619363:a_good_read_for_the_religious_ethicist.:adam_r._frank	Pojman does a superb job of illustrating many different approaches to ethics, providing examples of practical application of each. This helps the reader develop a critical mind, capable of reasoning his or her way through ethical dilemmas that we all face on a daily basis. Pojman is not afraid to go for the jugular on approaches in which he finds serious flaws, such as cultural and ethical relativism. The reader will find that Pojman does not adhere to one ethical theory in particular, but rather calls for reason and judgment, based on strong moral principles, in every situation. Some situtations call for a utilitarian approach, some for a virtue-ethical approach. Whatever approach he takes, however, will be based in thorough and sound reasoning. This book makes its readers want to be better people.	1

Although this camera is 6 mp, my 3.0 Cannon took much clearer pictures.  I have had this camera for 9 months and I am sending it in for the second time for repair.  First the power button stopped working, and then on Easter (something about holidays) all of the functions of the buttons switched.  When I pushed delete, the menu came up.  Even the mode selector wasn't working.  It was reviewing the pictures in all three modes.  I will say that sony support online is very helpful, but I need something more reliable.

B0000DEW91:i_like_it.:s._mccoy	This gate is easy to install and simple to operate once you get the hang of how it works.  My son is one and half years old and has a tendency to rush gates (he's broken two already...)  and so far, this one's holding up.  I would not recommend anyone use it at the top of stairs because it doesn't have an installation kit, but for hallways and at the bottom of the stairs it works really well.  It swings closed on its own and is pretty loud if you let it slam shut...  we use ours in the kitchen so it doesn't wake the babies up- however, if you were to use it in a hallway near where your kids are sleeping, it might be loud enough to disturb their sleep.	1

It is very sturdy and also attractive	1
572785	Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album, like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5. In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces.	0

B0009DT342:better_shave_than_a_razor_(but_i_suggest_getting_the_cleaning_base_too):m._landi	I have to say that I have been converted. For over 15 years now I lived with a razor. I have a pretty thick beard and it grows fast too. I am the kind of guy that gets a 5 o'clock shadow at noon. I have used every single type of razor out there from disposable to the battery operated vibrating type and from the one blade to the 5+1 blade. I have tried all the brands and ended up feeling the Gillette brand is the best type of razor, but now I find it's not the best shave. I used an electric shaver several years back, it was one of the top of the line Norelco with the incorporated gel. It gave me a pretty bad razor burn and did not get all the hairs; I ended up having to shave as normal. --TRUE STORY-- I am a Manager at my job and on my last annual review the only item I was marked bad was my personal appearance. Not that I dress bad or not wear deodorant, but that they felt I didn't shave often. (I shave at the very least every other day, usually every day). So I felt I had to so something about it. I researched electric shavers thinking I could get a quick shave during my lunch hour in my car or at least on my way to work so it would last longer. I found that Panasonic seems to be leading the pack and was moderately priced and had all the features the expensive models had. The instruction manual is explicit in saying it will take about 30 days to get used to any new shaving method and they assure you will love the Panasonic shaver once your facial hairs get used to the way it is cut. I have been using it for almost 30 days now, and I will not live without it. I have NEVER had this close of a shave before. I can actually go 2 days without getting a shadow. My fianc has found a new love for touching my face, and I seem to be getting more kisses too! During the first 2 weeks I had to get a couple of the missed hairs with my old Gillette, but today officially I was able to through my Gillette away for good. (My boss has even asked what I am doing different and when I told him, he went out and bought one too, he also loves it now. My fianc said she would leave me if I stopped using the Panasonic, it's a good thing Panasonic has been around for decades) So, I am raving about his product, but every good has its bad... what the bad? Well, it gets a couple of weeks to get used to the shave, but for the amount of time I am planning to use it and the money I am saving from buying razors every month, I can handle that. The cleaning system is very good, but it takes very long to clean (2-3 hrs) and it is noisy since the base turns the shaver on and off during the cleaning cycles. The cleaning cartage is said to last 3 months whether you use it once a day or one a week. I have not gotten to that point yet, but it is very very easy to clean in the shower with some body wash. I just end up using the base for the drying cycle, which is an option. The batter is very good. In the month I have used it, I have charged it twice but it really didn't need it as it said the charge was good. Overall... excellent product. Could there be a better shaver out there, maybe, will I ever know... at this time, I am not worried about it, I am very satisfied with this Panasonic, and don't think it can get any better. This product does not include the cleaning base. I do recommend it as even if you don't use it to clean the razor, you can use it to dry it, it will help keep your blades in the newest condition and prevent them from rusting when air drying. But, if you are looking to save money and get an excellent razor, this is it!	1
B00005BW6I:thought_it_was_great:	I received this as a gift and loved it at first.  But after using it just 3 times one of the support poles snapped when we were putting it up.  I was bummed too because I loved it so much.  If you do buy it, be careful when you handle it - it's not as durable as it seems	0
246023	This WiiPoints card, which is the equivalent of $20, allows one to purchase and download games from the Wii's virtual console, part of the Wii Shop channel. Already, at launch, 12 games throughout the history of gaming were available, including Pinball (Nintendo Entertainment System), Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega Genesis), SimCity (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), and Super Mario 64 (Nintendo 64). Nintendo is planning to add new games every Monday, to come to a total of 30 by the end of the year. Beyond that, "new classics" are coming throughout 2007 such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (Super Nintendo), and Mario Kart 64 (Nintendo 64). Many of these games can be controlled with the included Wii Remote or the backwards-compatible GameCube controllers. Some require the Wii Classic Controller, but a great number use the other two aforementioned control methods	1

B000HB33YM:nice,_but_picture_is_misleading:r._bower	I got this for my 2 year old for Christmas. It was a nice present, he enjoys it. 2 things though, it only came with 75 smaller balls so i had to purchase another 100 from somewhere else and the picture is misleading as to how big the item actually is. It could fit 2 toddlers in the pit itself and that would be max, and that is two 2-3 year olds. It is comparable though to other ball pits in size and he seems to enjoy the hoop and putting the ball through the hole in Big Bird's ice cream cone so i feel it was worth the money, especially since i didn't pay for shipping	1
222350	This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?	0
0805055614:disappointed:kristen_kordet	As a follower of the Celebration story for many years, I was greatly disappointed by what I thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town.  It was nothing of the sort.  The book had the feel of  so many pages of anti-Disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad  serial.  The authors of Celebration U.S.A. clearly made up their minds  about Celebration long before signing off on a mortgage.  Lacking in the  detail needed to illustrate Celebration's experiment with the tenets of  neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of cliched generalities  such as "a return to the past" and "recapturing tradition."  It soon became  some sort of mantra exhorting Disney's ownership of the town, the rules  imposed on property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the  attention the town received.  Most tactless of all was the shadow of  mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation with  neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the authors SHOULD have  been doing: giving the town a chance	0
10640	This game is a joke. It is the same exact game as the 2005 version with minimal additions. The online play is so glitchy and drops so often its not even worth the time. Do not go out and buy this game thinking that its better because of all the hype. If you want to play a great football game go get NFL 2K5 by 2KSports/Sega Sports. This game is 3 years old and blows Madden away any day of the week. In 2k5 you are able to go to roster manager and change your rosters to make them current. You can edit players and create rookies like Reggie Bush or Jerious Norwood and make the roster the same as the current 2007 NFL lineups. Madden bought the rights to be the only official Nfl game for the sole reason that Madden sucks and he wants to make all the money and not spend any money improving his game. Madden bought the rights to the Nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make an official Nfl game and thats why there is no 2k7 or any other game football game for it to compete with. Thats why Blitz is the only other game and they cannot use Nfl players so they have to have a generic game without real players. I hate Madden with a passion. 2K Sports is the way to go for any sports game including football you just have to do some manual labor updating rosters but once you have it is current and still 10x better than Madden will ever be. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0

459971	I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon.

It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off	0
B0000687FY:django_il_bastardo:christoph_niedermair	In response to the earlier reviewer, this is Sergio Garrone's Django il Bastardo, not the other film the reviewer mentioned. Django il Bastardo is a small gem among Spaghetti Westerns, a low budget B movie in which a ghost (Django) avenges his own death (a topic later adapted by Clint Eastwood for his &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;). Hence, Steffen's &quot;wooden&quot; acting is totally appropriate for the role. A little jewel with nice gothic atmosphere, innovative camera tricks and good supporting actors (a standout is Luciano Rossi as the main baddie's insane brother)	1
B00006G8HB:excellent_video_for_those_new_to_yoga:jennifer_blouin_"jenniegrrl"	I'm pretty new to the Yoga experience. I started with a Kathy Smith DVD (hated it!) then I got a Yoga Zone Video -- the one for flexibility and toning and I found it to be very good. I then got another video -- Yoga Shakti which is excellent too and I was looking for another beginner video (the Yoga Shakti one has some advanced parts in it) so I bought Yoga Zone -- Introduction to Yoga. While some of the moves in it are on my first video, I still found this to be very good for beginners. Alan again teaches you the breathing technique -- which I often forget.  I noticed on another review someone complained about the slowness of it. Yes, it does move slow HOWEVER if you're a beginner and you're just learning the poses, the last thing you would want is for it to move fast. He takes the time to explain each pose and how it should feel when you're doing it. His voice is very soothing and puts me in a calm frame of mind.	1

B0006J31X8:big_fan_of_clic_products_disappointed_with_clic_sport_google_:brad_q._post	I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!	0

179392	Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.	0

B00063NXHS:well-designed_for_making_the_switch_to_bottled_ink_(no_more_catridges!):k._yasuhara_"carless_in..."	I have a Lamy Safari and a Lamy Joy (both in the colored, plastic versions---not clear or aluminum).  I got this converter so I could eliminate the waste of disposable, plastic cartridges and use the bottled ink of my choice in my pens.  This converter has good capacity (refill frequency varies, of course, with ink, nib, paper, and writing habits) and a long knob with two flats that's easy to twist for refilling.  The body is clear and makes it easy to see how much ink is left through the windows in the pen body of the Safari and Joy.  With practice, I can now fill the converter with one hand, holding the converter body between my pinky and ring fingers and twist the plunger knob with my thumb and pointer finger.  This leaves my other hand free to tip the ink bottle, if necessary.  I've been using one of these converters for years, and they seem to last fine.  It's a simple device, but I can think of worse designs.	1
B00015YRF8:little_hesitant_:daniel	I was a little hesitant to purchase the Chrisopher Lowell Bill Organizer after reading some of the reviews.  I decided to go out on a limb and purchase one.  Mine came perfect, all the dividers, no assembly required what so ever.  I was worried that all the bills due the same day would not fit but they did.  I do take the bills out of the envelope before puting in the slot, and some slots have three to five bills in a single day.  I love it and would not trade it for the world.  IF you never want another late bill, buy one of these and use it.	1

B000HZTB80:horrible_support_but_a_good_unit:charles_w._gandy	I bought this unit for my wife and we received it this week. It works great. When I registered the unit on line I found that Magellan's website showed there were software updates for this unit (Roadmate 2000). I downloaded the update and after some difficulty I was able to perform the upgrade. I then found that the voice prompts no longer worked. I logged back onto their webpage and found that the firmware upgrade had been removed due to a technical issue they are working on to correct. I verified all of my settings and finally called Magellan support. The support group was hard to understand (they are located in India) and were unable to help me. I asked if this was a problem related to the upgrade since the voice prompts worked fine before the upgrade and they would not say. They asked that I upgrade the unit again (although the screen showing the firmware and OS versions showed the new version numbers) but by this time I was low on battery charge and could not perform the upgrade. This unit did not ship with an A/C adapter. I asked if there was a way to backout the upgrade and he (Tom) informed me there was not. I asked the tech again if this was a known issue and what other issues I might experience with this "upgrade" and after some time on hold he once again was evasive and would not answer my questions. I asked for a supervisor and after some more time on hold he told me one would call me back within 24 - 48 hours. I was not happy with this and said that was unacceptable to which he put me on hold some more after I told him I thought 1 to 2 hours is more along my expectations. He came back and said a supervisor would call me back in an hour. It is well over an hour and no call so far. I tried their Corp office and was routed by an ARU back to India. I called their Corp office again and after attempting the dial by name directory got to a receptionist named Marti who would not connect me to management. She said she would send me to Quality Assurance and they could escalate to management if necessary. I spent about 15 minutes on hold and was finally disconnected. I love the Magellan GPS units and I have three (Blazer 12, Explorist 210 and the Roadmate 2000) and each time I have had to call tech support I am very disappointed. I have to say I will not recommend their products to anyone else since I am really getting the impression they are disconnected with their client base and provide at least some answers.	0

No explanation why. Cannot cancel and get a refund of $150. Extremely disappointed. Should have ordered directly - another French weekly, subscribed directed from the publisher a month ago and already received two issues. I am not even sure at this point I would receive my paid subscription for Paris-Match. I contacted the publisher and they told me they provide US subscriptions through a completely different agent. So, Amazon, what do I do now about my subscription	0
B00008HBY8:should_be_advertised_as_a_"desktop_shredder":wayne_beckham	Like everyone else, I was looking for a way to destroy CD's/DVD's, primarily those used as backups.  Now that it's possible to back-up almost an entire hard drive to a very few CD-sized media, it's important to maintain possession and version control.  The possession is obvious: I wouldn't toss out an intact hard drive, for fear of identity theft, etc.  The same is true of your backup media.  Version control may be less obvious, but by dating my latest backups, and then shredding any older versions, I only have the "latest."  There are good reasons to keep your older media - I'm just not going to debate them here.	1

The Anniversary Party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain, self-absorbed, jaded and rich beyond most people's wildest fits of imagination. Worse, there isn't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people, or at least most people who are fun to be around, don't act the way these characters do.	0

Boy are we sorely disappointed.  The coffee part works fine.  Unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and doesn't even produce hot espresso.  I exchanged this once, hoping I just got a bad one but apparently the Krups XP2010 is designed badly.  Shame on Krups for releasing a premature, untested product	0
B000F4H5FE:wow_this_stuff_is_strong..:neal_vanderstelt_"neal"	Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product	1
B000096QQ5:great_for_quick_cleans:b's_mama	I only occasionally feed my baby, and my apartment doesn't have a dishwasher. I usually decide right before going out that I want to take a bottle, so this disinfects everything really quick - in 3 minutes. As opposed to boiling it in a pot of water for 20 minutes. ANd I don't use it every days, so I don't see the point in keeping everything sterlized cuz I would have to sterilize it again right before using.	1
B00005KID9:hate_it:carrie	Ok well unlike the other reviewers, I hate this ice cream scoop. Yes, it's heavy and seems to be well-engineered. However, I don't like the somewhat square shape of the handle and have a hard time getting a good grip on it. And as another reviewer already mentioned, it has a tendency to collect water in the handle when it is washed. When I'm scooping the ice cream, the water drips out and down the handle, thus making it even harder to grip the handle. It makes the handle slippery and my hand just slides right down to the scoop and I get ice cream all over my hand. I have a cheap $2 plastic scoop that I bought when I was in college, and I prefer it to this one.	0
B00005BTNA:too_difficult_for_a_newborn_to_suck.....no_good__for_the_first_month_at_least.:minami	Initially, I thought these angled bottles make a lot of sense so I put different sizes into our registry. However, when our baby girl (1 week old) first tried to suck the milk out from the bottle, it did not come out. My husband had activated the vent and did everything according to the instructions. He thought the holes were not big enough since he did not see any on the nipple, so he put more holes on them but still nothing came out. He finally found out the way that these bottles work are not the same as a traditionally bottle does. The hole will not open unless pressure is applied against it and hole will get sealed back again when released. Baby has to use their tongue to push against the nipples in order to open up the hole. For a newborn infant, it is too difficult for them to figure out how to get the milk out especially if you are bottle feeding only. Luckily we had two Avent bottles (with the traditionally hole idea) so she is doing very well with the Avent bottles and she still loves them a lot. We ended up returning the unused VentAir bottles and got a lots of AVENT bottles but still stuck with the opened ones. I do not recommend these 'difficult' bottles for newborn. Baby should not need to 'think' how to get the milk out.	0

They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear.

B0002EQUL2:good_sound,_low_volume:me_"i_luv_music"	They are good for the price. They have a very good sound quality, or at least better than the ones that came with my Sony Walkman DEJ001. The only problem I had is when I connected them to my older Philips player, it had a low volume output. And then again, even on the Sony player, I had to have the volume at 7, and it only goes to 9. If you have a high output player or a computer, these will be great, but if your using them for a low output or old device, these probably won't cut the cheese	1

B0006TSZ70:the_only_bikini_briefs_not_designed_by_a_woman...:m._rauscher	These are the only semi-affordable bikini briefs I've found that are actually designed with a "pouch", making them the most comfortable on the market (of all the brands I've tried, that is). Unfortunately, they're difficult to locate in typical retail outlets, and you'll probably have to purchase them from an Amazon outlet that has exorbitant shipping charges, but what can I say. I guess it's worth it.	1
414579	If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360, buy this game first as your last Xbox game, you won't be disappointed. This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console. Although it has great graphics, the physics are the real selling point. You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun (Zero-Point Energy Manipulator). Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic. The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should (especially when you shoot them with the shotgun). The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around. The only drawback is choppy framerates at times. Highly recommended	1
B000HGE2YM:dismal_performance:m._dimitroff	I measured 7 batteries out of the pack of 20 with La Crosse charger, which I also bought from Amazon.  The capacity ranged from 547 mAh to 2002 mAh, with the average being 886 mAh.  That's about a third of the stated capacity.  Before I took the measurements, I made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of AA NiMH batteries: La Crosse and Energizer.  Both scored very close to their stated capacity.  Therefore, the test is valid and SUNPAK's claim of 2650 mAh is grossly overstated.	0

B00007C65S:nice_product:zhuo_li_"zhybear"	My wife bought this one when my daughter was 2 months old. We feed our daughter with bottles (mix formula with breast milk), and since each time we need to take the bottled breast milk from ref (my wife did breast bumping), and mix with formula, we use this warmer all the time. Also, when we travel out, this one is quite useful. Generally with only a little small amount of water, the bottle is warm enough to feed my baby. Also it is quite compact to put in the diaper bag (well, not compact bag though)	1

204322	Although I have only read a few specific subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...	0

B000AXQFJ2:works_good_in_noisy_areas.:d._howard	I've used this model headset for 6 months, and the sound quality is great. I drive a truck for a living, and needed a headset with low backgound noise from the truck. The "windstop" technology works good. I wear it about 6-7 hours a day. The earpiece can be straightened slightly to minimize discomfort. Only problem is it disconnects sometimes at "rest". It beeps when it disconnects, and reconnects automatically, usually within a minute or two. Would (and have) recommended to friends	1

321432	This DVD gives a very good 60 minute workout. As others have pointed out the cardio is very dancy. The first time I did it, I felt a bit awkward with the steps, but when I did it the second time I was able to follow along with no problems. The dance moves are a fun change up from my usual routine. If someone like Denise Austin were leading this one, I don't think I would play along. Minna is by far my favorite instructor, so I go along with it and it ends up being a fun workout. I wouldn't want to do this every day, but it is good to have something different in the rotation.	1
1566252172:this_is_a_book_of_fiction,_no_mention_of_craps_strategy:chalon_jackson	This book is more of an advertisement for Scoblete's other books, his writing buddies other books, and his golden touch craps siminar. This book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control, which is the reason I bought this book. The book is rather a collection of stories. Scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps. It would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up, especially the Captain, the authors ultimate craps hero. I couldn't even finish this book. It was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through, and left the reader with no knowledge gained. If you are interested in a good casino book I recomend something by Avery Cardoza or a book published by his company	0
B000BB6MCS:didn't_work_at_all:isis	I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	0

B000FFTH0O:like_having_air_conditioning_on_your_bike:drew_commins	Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down.	1
564231	As someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier, organic way of life, I decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter.  Many did not strike my fancy.  For example, I found Organic Style Magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste, while Mind, Body, and Spirit Fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all.  Natural Health, however, falls somewhere in between, covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet, natural remedies, beauty, and food/recipes.  As someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy, I appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer.	1
630195517X:gruelling:jeffrey	Most serious directors and actors aspire to a level of professionalism that seems effortless to the point of casual.  Like the best baseball outfielders catching swirling flyballs with a nonchalant jog and a flick of the wrist.  On the other hand, Kinski and Herzog want you to feel every moment of effort, every muscle twitch, the oppresive heat, the mind-numbing glassy eyed exhaution,  the dangerous waters, & the sleepless nights. Watching this movie, I can easily imagine the furious arguments and sullen bitterness of men pushed to their creative and physical limits. They suffered to make this movie and they want you to know it.  Herzog's actors tolerate conditions and exertions far beyond the call of duty and for what?  To make a flick.  Aguirre's men tolerated far more for gold most didn't live to see.  At the heart is the titular character, played by Kinski as a wild eyed wraith more dead than alive as he descends into an utter madness as a refuge against the ordeal and death he presides over.  To know anything about Kinski is to know that Aguirre is not a terrible stretch for him.  If anything, his performance is more brave in its selfexamination than creative in its acting chops. Herzog, for his part, seems to be a good old-fashioned meglomaniac as he appears to derive great satisfaction from pushing his cast and crew far beyond normal limits and treating them like little toy people so he can be a rich famous director. He has a singular vision and is determined to see it on the screen, no matter what.  He is a throwback to the American studio director/petty tyrants like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock (a gentleman tyrant who referred to actors as cattle), Michael Curtiz and many others.  Herzog is determined to control and Kinski resists control and their collaborations are the output of a kind of two brained insane but brilliant filmmaker. Aguirre is almost two movies.  One is a brillant study of madness and ordeal and the other is an equally fascinating, if unintentional, documentary of two difficult half mad professional collaborators making a great movie often in spite of themselves	1
B00015BHCY:stoped_working_after_1.5_years._wished_it_lasted_longer:j._spett_"simply_choying"	My wife got this Cuisinart Classic Toaster oven as a wedding gift. We liked the appearance and had it on our registry. We used this toaster oven a lot because it cooked very well. Toast was perfect, and the oven cooked nice and hot.

We would take the baking pan/and crumb tray and use our regular self cleaning oven to clean those, but it would take a lot of scrubbing to clean the glass and interior of the oven.	0

I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.

B0006OMUVW:disappointing:w.a.	The batteries that come with this charger we're not a problem for me.  In fact, I was surprised that they were fully charged right out of the package and seem to work fine.  I was however, disappointed in the charger.  The charger requires that all four AA batteries be in the charger for it to work.  You cannot charge just one, two or three batteries because the circuit is not complete without all four batteries inserted. Also, there are a maximum of two slots for AAA batteries and when they are in use none of the other AA slots are usable.  Given the price of NiMH batteries, the charger works out to be about $2... which is about what it's worth at best.	0
90277	In the several years since my retirement, I have come to wait by my trusty old rusted metal mailbox around the third or fourth of every month, waiting for my monthly issue of two magazines, the Atlantic Monthly and Harpers. Each in iuts own way is likely the best amalgams of intellectual articles on a variety of subjects one can find in contemporary America, and each features a stable of highly regarded writers and authors. For good reason; from subjects as arcane as the supposed imminent fall of the Soviet union based on demographic and economic analysis in the mid-1980s to the recent synopsis of former spy Robert Baer regarding the evils of dealing with the highly corrupted Saudi regime, the magazine consistently offers an erudite, informative, and provocative look at aspects of contemporary reality one cannot find elsewhere.	1

251914	I have owned several Canon digital cameras and like them very much.  I purchased the A520 as a gift for a family member.  After several months the lens cover problem that everyone writes about started happening.  It would stick paritally open or closed or all the way open.  The key word being stick or stuck.  I took it to a Canon Service Center and they repaired it under warranty.  After trying to use it for the 1st time several weeks later the lens cover was stuck open and would not budge.  I took it back to the Service Center and they repaired it again.  While looking at the paperwork after the repair they stated courtesy repair only and not under warranty.  It was under warranty and had 90 days from the date they did not repair it the first time.  After emailing Canon they said to just email them if I have a problem and they would see what they could do.  Very POOR.  I like Canon digital cameras but wish I had never purchased the A520.  I bought it because of it's low price, which was a big mistake	0

B000JOOGK2:where_is_the_key_that's_in_the_photo?:k._glann	Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy	0
B0000BX73E:don't_do_it!_(unless_you_have_to,_of_course):leslie_k._thompson	This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either.	0

My current machine is an AMD Athlon XP with the 333 FSB, 1 Gig ram & 80 Gig HD shared on network & a 40 Gig HD for software, OS is XPpro, it's 2 years old I think. I installed three cathode ray tubes, you know; big boxy monitors, the largest of which is a 21 inch monster right in my face all day. I read the reviews here and started "Quaking" in my boots! Oops I said to myself, and I looked up my previous day's purchases for the new Artist I just hired. Sure enough; I bought CS2 for the new machine. So I downloaded the 30 day trial for Illustrator CS2 Upyours, I mean Upgrade. Replacing my old Illustrator 8.01 These kids I've been interviewing made me think I should take a look outside MY CAVE!

0785110828:the_best_the_ultimate_universe_has_to_offer....:e._johnson_"supertzar2069"	This fantastic re-imagining of the Avengers is best consumed in this form. Yes there are too many pop culture references, yes the hulk is a little goofy and the Ultimate Nick Fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but I think once your done with this gigantic, thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about. This story arc takes the Alternate Universe Avengers from their creation to their first major victory, ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good. The second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well. This is the best that the Ultimate universe has to offer, is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers, no inline skates, teen angst, or first love in this one.	1
B00081NER2:great_buy:shuchita_sonalika_"shuchi"	The day I ordered this pair at Amazon, I saw the same Homedics slippers at Sears for $21.99 on sale and I was immediately assured that price wise, this is a great buy. I got the slippers within 3 days. The material is very soft and "towely", and pretty in pink- it feels really good to just walk in them. Though they have a battery compartment underneath the sole, they are not too heavy to walk in either. Each slipper uses 2 AA batteries. The massage is actually more effective while sitting. And my mum and my sister keep eyeing my slippers. I ordered another one for my future mum-in-law as well! I'm sure she'll love it. Also, I wear a shoe size 8, sometimes 8.5, but the Homedics Small Size for the massaging slippers fit just fine, actually a little better coz a good fit gives a better feeling of the vibrations. If you're thinking of buying this, go for it	1

B00009KN1D:great_for_just_1_and_half_years,_until_it_started_folding_up_while_in_use.:hipster	This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, "Sorry, you are out of warranty" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller	0

1585424129:turn_off_the_boob_tube_and_turn_on_the_boobs:orenda	Annie Sprinkles very personal heart felt Spectacular Sex Guide inspires us into our sexual potential giving us the tools for sexual transformation. Even if we already have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises here to try. I can relate to Annie's libraries of sexual experience even though I have not taken as many adventures as her. Really folks if some of us turned off our TVs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom. My favorite quote would be "Don't worry; be horny." Now that this wonderful book has been put on sale there couldn't be a better time to buy it	1

B0007YJGXG:an_unusual_and_beautiful_yoga_practice...:l._landau_"teacher_and_student"	In sanskrit, Ayurveda means the study of life. According to ancient Hindu texts, all healing systems stem from Ayurvedic medicine. This Ancient Ayurveda series dvd, led by Sarah Tomlinson with clarity and insight, provides a blueprint for increasing self-awareness through the use of asana, symbol and metaphor. Tomlinson, acts like a loving guide to going inward and discovering new self-truths. To effectively bring about change in our bodies and minds, we must change habitual patterns in the body. The poses in the series takes us through a full range of challenging movements, and Tomlinson illuminates the wisdom of this practice by brilliantly threading together how the poses evoke certain states of mind and spirit. Filmed against a simple, soothing background, Tomlinson wisely avoids distracting bells and whistles. Instead, the accompanying chanting by ayurveda master Gandharva,directly relates to the series in it's use of each of the planetary mantras.	1
286927	John Waters who likes to be called the "Pope of Trash" has done a lot of films that are outrageous in style such as "Cecil B. Demented," "Pecker," & "Hairspray." "Cry Baby" is a 1990 musical that is utterly silly and frothy, but works nevertheless. Johnny Depp, now a big box office draw and critical success with Oscar nominations for "Finding Neverland" & "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," can be proud of the rockabilly Elvis-type singer he plays named Wade "Cry Baby" Walker. Depp performs his "Jailhouse Rock" type number with great energy and rebellion. Having him run through sewage pipes in his underwear is enough to set many a teenage girl's hearts aflutter. The female lead is Allison played by Amy Locane who worked in other films like "Airhead," "The Mummy" & "Bongwater." She does a good Olivia Newton John-like "Grease" character of the square girl who has a crush on Depp's bad boy. Stephen E. Miller who was recently seen in "RV" with Robin Williams and previously in "The Accused" with Jody Foster does a good job as the square boyfriend Baldwin who loses his girl to Cry Baby.	1
B0007ZH8XA:immediately_frustrated:r.k.l.	I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!	0

B0007D3B56:very_sexy:mc_micky	This is a very suttle fragrance, that lasts for hours.

B0000669F7:hideaway_review:wesley_bell	Hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it.  Easily assembled, up within 60 seconds. I have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway, presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground. There was no rope or stakes with the purchase, I am unaware if these should have been included. Two entrances into the hideaway, the front inverted T entrance is great. However, the rear is a porthole type entrance, not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom. Material not that durable, but with care there should be no issues. a lot bigger than it looks on the site, which was a nice surprise.	0

129653	I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.

474706	So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion	0
0786145366:a_pleasant_little_visit_to_a_small_town_in_quebec..._well,_except_for_the_murder_and_all:joseph_p_menta_jr.	Though I usually go in for tough police thrillers, I sometimes mix things up by reading a light, funny mystery or- like this book- a quiet, thoughtful mystery set in a small town (a "cozy", I believe this type of mystery novel is called).  "Still Life" nicely combines the easygoing attributes of a "cozy" mystery- quirky, eccentric characters, a small-town setting, pretty much no violence- with a little modernity, in the form of occasional well-placed profanity (though not much) and modern demographics (a gay couple is included among the main characters).	1

B0009OAHIW:too_musky_for_me!:t._berry	I really wanted to love this fragrance...after all, it is quite expensive and I'd read rave reviews on many websites...but after one spritz I sold it to a friend of mine! My favorite perfumes are Beyond Paradise, Ralph Lauren Romance, Ralph Lauren Style, and DKNY Be Delicious. Light Blue, to me, smells overwhelmingly of musk. I wore it all day and I ended up feeling nauseous, with a bad headache. This must be one of those perfumes that works well on most everyone else except for me	0

252118	This program is positively wonderful for word practice and pronunciation with a number of flash-card style game and  a very elegant listen-record-replay interface.

0064404781:don't_let_these_books_color_your_memories_of_laura:corinna	This series is a travesty. I understand the feeling of loss when you finish a beloved series, but let Laura, not MacBride, have the last word on her family's experience. So much in his books rings false: the clumsy historical allusions, the narrative voice, the potty humor . . . One of the greatest things about Laura Ingalls Wilder's work is the way her voice advances in maturity as she, the main character, grows: Big Woods is written for little girls and Happy Golden Years for young women. MacBride doesn't manage this and talks down to readers. There is a tiny thread of Laura in these books, but not enough to do more than frustrate her fans. Sampling is for rap, not fiction.	0

341736	As we near the end of the life span of the last generation of consoles, key franchises that have appeared year after year begin to wrap up their yearly development cycle. Crazy as it may sound, Madden NFL 07 could be one of the last times we see Madden on the Xbox, PlayStation 2, or the GameCube. With that in mind, it's not altogether surprising that Madden 07 doesn't really push the envelope terribly far. The game includes a few new control features and some mode tweaks (nearly all of which are also available in the Xbox 360 version of this year's game), but for the most part, it feels like the result of a series pushed as far as it can possibly go on a given platform, and you definitely get the sense that Madden on current-generation consoles is beginning to wind down. However, for at least this last year, the veteran player outraces the up-and-comer in the Xbox 360 version, and there are certainly enough compelling reasons to check this year's game out on the older consoles.	1

B0002T8VKA:easy_maintenance_for_betta:lori	I purchased this for a betta fish, which was a gift for my cats.  This model was perfect because the lid screws on, which eliminates any fear of my cats lifting the lid to get to the fish.  There is a small hole at the top, so you don't have to unscrew the lid to feed the fish.  The "aqua gems" cover the bottom, but I added some gravel for additional covering.  Also, the aqua gems are light, and you lose some when changing the water, so some other covering will likely need to be added eventually.  The one negative I found is that the light is basically useless.  It illuminates nothing and the batteries die quickly.  Other than that, I'm very satisfied.  I did look at PetSmart for additional oxygen stones, but they don't sell them.  Not sure if those are really necessary, though	1

B00006I5MQ:crap:back_in_sd	I had a Pronto NEO for less than a year before the touchscreen failed after I dropped it 1.5 feet onto a hardwood floor.  The unit has a very cheap feel, especially for the price.  I wasn't at all surprised when it stopped working.  The PC software that you use to customize the touchscreen is crap.  The touchscreen is very tedious to customize (I write software for a living, and I still found it cumbersome to customize the touchscreen).  I can't imagine the average consumer being able to customize this unit, given the effort that it takes to struggle with the software and to transfer the information from your PC to the remote.  The whole point of the Pronto NEO is that you can customize the touch screen.  Unless you are VERY comfortable with computer applications, do not buy this unit.  Aside from the touchscreen's fagility, is not sensitive enough to the touch and the area of the screen is too small, given the size of the remote.  Did I mention the batteries did not last more than 2 months?  In short, this product is crap.  I might consider buying another one if it sold for $30 or less	0

B0002OQGAW:good_quality_silk:anna_v._onan_"silk_enthusiast"	Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up	1
B000001M0Z:great_cd_for_babies:r._jefferson_"romance_enthusiast"	This is one of my personal favorites.  I bought this CD when my daughter was 1 month old.  We would listen to it during those "late night" feedings to create a peaceful environment.  I'm pretty sure it was a benefit for her.  It was definitely a benefit for me	1
B00005CDSF:defective_switch:j._w._smith_iv	Don't waste your time and money on this product.  I have gone thru 3 of these in the last 6 months, two in the last week.

B000JGERAO:it_works!_just_modify_the_directions_and_your_expectations:bluestocking	Having had perfectly clear skin through my teens, 20s, and most of my 30s, I now have post-pregnancy adult-onset cystic acne that began at age 36. My skin is far too delicate and sensitive to tolerate most OTC acne products. I bought this product out of desperation, not believing it would work. After reading hundreds of reviews and advice and testing it for 2 weeks, I have found that it works well, with some modifications. My experience: cystic acne goes through its normal cycle (rising to surface, becoming a hideous scab, etc.) in a fraction of the normal time (4 days versus 4 weeks) when treated as directed with Zeno, OR it disappears completely without ever having risen to the surface (after a week or so), when treated very aggressively with Zeno. My advice: Don't expect it to work after 1-3 treatments and in 24 hours as advertised. Do know that with diligence and patience, it will work. Be very aggressive. Do double-cycles (allow the Zeno to remain on your skin after it beeps, then press the button for a second cycle) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way. You may get very slight burning of your skin (causing a whitish film or slight peeling) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly, but believe me, it's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne. I am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition, and seeing the results I have hoped for after 2 weeks	1

B000051SEP:great_watch:scott_a._manthey	Looks great, functions great.  Manual is a little daunting and a couple of the words on the display are very small.  I have 20/20 vision and I can't always read everything that is being displayed.  It is mostly in the Alt and Barometer functions where there is lots of info being shown.	1
B000EQ5TSI:a_movie_for_idiots:shawn_watson_"god_of_gods"	Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.	0
B000E8O8UQ:a_great_hair_dryer:chrishel	I purchased this hairdryer after my professional Conair Yellowbird from the late 70's broke.  I definitely wanted another Conair and I wanted to move into the 21st Century!  I did the research and this hairdryer had the most features for the best price.  I wasn't disappointed.  As the other reviewers have stated, this hairdryer dries your hair in half the time!  It's also nice to reduce the static in your hair when you want to freshen up and are "dry brushing" your hair.  It does draw a lot of power when on high heat and the highest blowing setting and the lights in my dressing room will dim.  Otherwise, it is very solidly built and I hope to have this hairdryer for another 30 years.	1
B000G33VMU:it_does_work_if....:d._m._"crazilittledi"	NV diet pills are working great for me- I lost 8lbs in a month!!! they work as long as you eat healthy and exercise regularly while taking the pills. It isn't a miracle pill so if you take it but eat nonstop all day and don't work out, of course nothing is going to happen. They really do control hunger because I take 2 a day and one day I was busy and forgot to take my 2nd pill and I was STARVING looking to eat anything and everything in sight	1
B000BM67XG:very_poor_software:mark_d._perry	I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money.	0

B000C29JSU:fun_and_interesting_concept:michele_thompson	This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive	1
B0001MKTZS:nothing_compares:soulfunky	The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!	1

B000HJ175G:you_have_to_download_amazon_software_into_your_pc...:e._heneghan_"speakeasyglobal.org"	I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.	0
B000GAYYCE:great_idea,_in_theory....:e._c._kukay_"bunny"	I saw this at the store, and I just had to buy it.  I loved all the little pockets for storing different things; it would keep all my baby changing gear and other necessities all in one place.  The picture on the cover shows it stocked full and hanging on the side of a dresser, which can be used as a changing table.  What a marvelous concept!  So, I took it out of the package, attached it to the dresser and put all of my gear onto it.  It looked very smart hanging there, and so practical!  When I came in the room the next day, it was on the floor in a crumpled lump.  So, a little disheartened, but not wanting to give up, I hooked it up to my crib, instead.  It was the next best thing and I really did like the device.  I put all of my gear on there once more, the wipes on the top shelf just like the picture, but the top shelf is so flimsy that the wipes topple off of it.  So, not only can I not hook it up to my changing table, I also can't keep all of the changing gear on it.  This essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless for the purpose it was designed.	0
B0000C9ZBX:even_good_for_nudists:impartial_shopper	This watch is so light and thin but so good-looking that even my husband, who doesn't like watches weighing him down, wears it every day.

B000EJQJ1G:great_product:erin_l._reed	Very impressed so far. Used it to recondition 2 batteries and charge up 2 others and it has worked flawlessly.

B000BNY7KK:no_more_searching_through_the_diaper_bag!:dayle_tuna_"mother_of_3"	Love it, love it, love it! No more digging through the diaper bag or my purse for dirty, lint covered binkies. It could be a little bigger, for my toddlers binky but they do fit inside and it's a great idea	1
B00024JO6U:takes_space_away_-_doesn't_create_it!:bill_lambeer_tough_guy	How does it create space? If you have a cabinet that is 12 inches high, 15 inches deep and 14 inches wide, and put this large plastic item inside it, will that give you more space or take it away? The manufacturers must not be very logical or are trying too hard to sell you something you don't need.	0
B0002JKPB8:caruso_c97953_salonpro_30:bhg_"frank"	I purchased the Caruso for my wife after returning a Conair Infinity. The Conair Infinity did not measure up to her expectations. She is happy with the Caruso and feels that it does an good job setting curl. I will offer a few observations of my own. I would think that companies that produce these devices would be more sensative to the needs of a broader spectum of customer. For instance, women have different lengths of hair. This device provides 6 petite, 6 small, 6 medium, 6 large, 6 jumbo. That might be fine for women with shoulder length hair, but not for everyone.	1

56142	I would say that this is the closest that Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album.

I love the rest of this.	1

The blue is actually more of a royal blue than navy blue, but the lettering is well stitched and is the same quality used on MLB baseball caps (also has the MLB logo on back). It folds up easily and can be tucked into a jacket pocket with room to spare. The price is great and makes a great gift	1

B000GFWI22:always_hits_the_spot:r._dodd_"drrhonda"	I love Splenda and I love getting it in a big bag.  As a good ole Oklahoma girl, I live for my iced tea.  And my tea MUST be sweet, but sugar isn't an option.  So SPLENDA to the rescue.  We use it in everything and are learning new ways to use it every day because my Daddy has developed diabetes.  The big bags are often out at our local grocery store, so finding them at Amazon with our Amazon PRIME takes care of that problem	1
B0002S30RU:stay_away_from_this_equipment:rongkai_zhao	At the beginning, I really thought this is a very nice product. It does solve the CD organize and automatic storage problem for many people. However, this equipment is poorly engineered. I bought four units and all of them failed within a year for various reasons. There is no easy way to even take the discs out of the faulty units. If you ever think about move this equipment to another room, it is almost bound to fail. Customer service usually take 2 days to respond. The phone service guys do not answer questions about disc stakka because they know this is a bad product and rather not to deal with it with the disappointed customer. Imagining someone charges your $400 to organize 300+ CDs for a year and then quit. I am completely pissed off.	0
B00004YA6T:terribly_disappointed!!!!__curse_words!!!!:rhonda_g._crow	I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.	0

The look of the scale(in the photo)was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial, ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring.	0
B0002SPQ1I:a_near_return_to_greatness.:sharon_brice	When this first was released I really wasn't expecting much. The last two releases Mega-Dave put out Risk, and the World Needs a Hero excluding the live Rude Awakening while certainly had some moments were 3 out of 5 material, but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around. However, this album from the up tempo Blackmail the Universe, Kick the Chair which could have been on Rust In Peace, the Scorpion another return to form, and Back in the Day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album. I wouldn't put this up there with Rust In Peace or Countdown, but I certainly would put this up there with So Far So Good or Youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums, and put's it into one. If your a new fan and just getting into Megadeth this isn't a bad place to start. Certainly a must have, and am looking forward to the brand new album next year. Long Live Mega-Dave	1
B00008GQAP:flexible_hose_won't_hold_up:p._wickersham	First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon	0
B00092CZUW:a_great_way_to_waste_$10.:tox_nut_"woodworking_addict"	The cable is really junk.  All I want is a cable to sync my phone and update software.  It won't do it.  Half of the time the computer fails to recognize the phone is connected.  A motorola brand data-only cable works just fine.  I was warned not to invest in cheap cables and I wish I would have listened.  The one potential plus is that it has a charger inline incase you nuke your phone and need to reload drivers.  Problem is, the thing connects and disconnects constantly torturing you with the beeps of connecting/disconnecting as mentioned above.  Save money and buy the OEM part.	0
B000FEGUIW:philips_norelco_7140xl_review:joe_diamond	Upgraded from an old Norelco to this and just love it. Shaves close and almost effortlessly including the very course hair over the upper lip.

If you need a very good basic electric shaver for a good price, this is a great choice	1
B00005QF4E:not_what_i_expected:ann	Cheaply put together and does not include the things listed on the editorial review.  I am extremely disappointed.

I just cant believe it is such poor quality coming from Crayola	0
588876	I love this thing. It's awesome. The older version of DS was a little clunky and childish looking. This thing rocks my socks off! It's sleek, sexy, and portable. It's like an iPod of video games. You don't have to buy batteries. It comes with an extra stylus. Its screen is brighter. The sound is stereo! This thing is super dope! It's the freshest thing out there! You gotta get one. Sell your old DS on here on amazon and put the money toward the new one. You'll love it	1

I formatted the card and it now has 2 MB of bad sectors.  Unlike the other reviewer I did had 2 GB to begin with. But I think it is bad quality product and thats why it is dearth cheap.

B00021E5OE:it's_no_miracle_product,_but_it_seems_to_work.:j._schmidt	I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot	1
B000IEVVJM:tiny_dehumidifier__but_packs_a_punch!!!:e._bailey_"eve"	When I first saw this dehumidifier I couldn't stop laughing. This little bitty thing was supposed to tackle my moisture overload in a large storage shed? I figured that something was better than nothing until I could buy a better(bigger) dehumidifier. I hooked the little one up and come back the next day to check out the progress and much to my surprise the little-bitty sucked up an inch of water...in one night!!! Now I am so confident that this will do the job I will recommend this for anyone with a similar problem. The free shipping was a great plus as well!!	1

415953	Ok, I imagine if you forked over the $900 for this baby you would not want me telling you that you got a bad deal, but I am going to say it anyway.

0452265010:love_letters_is_simple,_yet_heartbreaking:	Love Letters has a very simple concept: Two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. They never look at each other. But within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the  play will carry you away with delight.  I read this play as I was browsing  through a bookstore. I just wanted to read the first couple of pages since  I'd heard so much about it. After page three, I didn't want to put it down.  Now I'm  buying it for a friend.  Don't think this play is a sappy  collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. If you have  ever been in love, you WILL recognize parts of yourself in this. It always  stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so  heartbreakingly wonderful	1

330213	I have been looking for an easier way to protect the front my my lens without having to either take off my lens hood or trying to fumble around with the lens cap with the hood still on.  Op/Tech came up with the solution!  All you have to do is stretch the proper size hood hat over the hood and everything is protected and ready to go.  Super easy to take off, putting on takes a little more time, but you never miss a picture putting it on anyway.  Basically this is an inexpensive way to add some extra insurance against getting dirt, water, etc on your front element while you are walking around looking for shots.  It is also very flexible and easy to stick in a pouch or pocket when not being used	1

B00008W71M:not_heavy_duty:l._merritt	This is the second Weber Mitt that I've tried. They both burned through within two weeks. There are other, heavier-duty mitts avaiable that will last a lot longer	0
B000CI6FGS:faded_out_in_spots!!!!:k._nelson_"mom_of_3"	I loved these sheets when I first got them.  They look expensive and have a nice thick feel to them.  After laundering them in cold water by themselves once a week for 2 months they started to fade, and worse yet started developing spots of discoloration in a bright orange color on the pillowcases!  I have laundered these in Tide with NO bleach!  What a shame they did not hold up well	0
334783	Kissinger, Honorary Chairman of The National Interest, was going to head-up the 9/11 Whitewash Commission, but he begged off when families objected.  Dov Zakheim, the 2.3 trillion dollar missing and unaccounted for Pentagon funds Man, is on the journal's board.  One is better off reading Commentary Magazine, where at least  the "Neocon fascist madmen" (in Web Tarpley's phrase) state their case in clearer and more honest - if that's the word - prose.	0

B00006WNRX:good_in_principle:v._kidambi	First of all the item is too small.  it is about 1/3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1/3 as wide.  So as you can see it is pretty small.  So it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again.	0
B0000VMCEQ:quality!:kathleen_m._klavon_"the_truth_is_out_there"	I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring.  When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is!  It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine.  This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.	1
B000B74DYQ:not_highly_recommended!:lisa_m._anderson	We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!	0
B000E3AP5I:bucket_seat_covers:michele_bowers	It is always hard to judge a product by a picture. They looked dark on my computer, but I ordered them anyway because I liked the graphic.I am so glad I did. They are actually a steel blue and they look great. I am very pleased and have recieved many compliments. They were easy to install and the quality exceded my expectations. I would recommend them to anyone who loves fairys.	1
B00027JY80:double_trouble_-_elvis_presley:	I really enjoyed this movie! Its not one of the best and a little cheesy! but easy to watch and one of the funniest films ive seen him in!Just a shame he never got to show us what a good actor he could have been	1
B000B6MLEQ:don't_expect_too_much........:eligbl1_"eligbl1"	After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original	0
524918	I love this flash.  I just recently purchased it and have used it for 2 big events and it worked perfectly.  I still don't know everything that it is capable of doing but am still able to work it just fine without even reading the manual.	1

B00061U68E:chocolatey_goodness_from_japan:your_mom_"supercalifragilisticexpialodocius"	These are another neat taste experience from japan. The chocobabies, however, contain shellac as an ingredient, which kinda turned me off to them when I learned about it. The stars in this set are the strawberry-chocolate cone things, whatever they're called. They're delicious! Also, the coffee flavored ones are excellent. I'm finding I am a fan of just about anything made by Meiji, and this set is no exception	1
B00008O0ZX:wonderful_toy:s._weber	What a wonderful toy. The no volume control worried me, but it isn't that loud. Great value,Great toy	1
B000FA7PUI:if_you_can_have_only_one_radio:m._jeffrey_mcmahon_"herculodge"	Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.	1
B000E4C898:tastes_ok,_some_tough_bits:jesse_d._spears_"traveller_on_the_path_of_peace"	I was trying these as a change of pace from the Turkey Jerky I normally eat.  They taste ok (nothing special), but several of the medallions (in at least 3 bags so far) had 'crunchy' bits in them.  I suspect it was gristle, or possibly small bone fragments.  Not pleasant to eat.	0
B00005O5AZ:substitute_3_review:crazy_jim	Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's &quot;The Substitute&quot; has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess	0

B0000DBHHR:great_gate:james_"james"	I have been using two gates for the last year to keep my 2 year old off of the stairs. The gates are attached to the walls. I have not had any problems with the either gate. For those of you searching for a gate for a dog, the gate works will with by 70 pound Boxer.	1

B0006I8GVQ:csi_ny_coroner_glasses:sheila_a._russell	These are great glasses, easy to put on and take off, and are there around your neck waiting for you to use them. I saw them on the CSI NY coroner on TV and had to find some.  Amazon was the place to go	1
B0002PC5DS:felt_like_i_had_a_wedgie...:s._"strap"	Like a permanent wedgie, these kept riding up my crack.  I don't recommend these at all...the liquid metallic look is only useful if you're going to be a male stripper.  Otherwise, you've got liquid metal up your crack...not very appealing	0
289752	This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap	0
B000G0QP8K:like_a_nice_piece_of_furniture:t._angelo	Very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate, this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room.  Our dog - a rescued Border Collie - is incontinent, so she cannot roam around the house.  And while she prefers being outdoors, with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside, in the same room as her family (instead of out back in the mud room, where her old wire cage was)	1
B000E130FW:comfortable_&_quiet:legal&sane	I've had this bike for about a month now and it runs smoothly, went together fairly easy, and best of all ITS QUIET!  Something I seriously appreciate in exercise equipment is when I can actually hear the television over the machine.  The complaints about the box falling apart during shipping is legitimate.  The bike I received had a cracked cover because of the dent in the box (arrived when I was at work or I'd have sent it back).  When I called for service I was greeted promptly, promised a replacement cover, and told that although they were instructed to tell me ten days they'd bet more like 3-5.  They even suggested that I consider where I was in the setup before I assembled the bike and whether or not I'd want to take it apart to put the new part in.  Very positive experience... now if I could just get myself to spend more time on it	1
B00012BSOY:not_recommended:l._eckley_"lindsey"	Although Crayola is a wonderful brand, I was not impressed with their Color Wonder fingerpaints.  The time between when my children put it on the paper and the time it actually appears is too long for them, and they get frustrated.  It is very hard to keep their attention long enough to make an entire picture.  Also, it is not "mess free."  The paints are very greasy and you end up cleaning it off of everything they touch (other than paper) anyways.  I did not like how mushy the paint was...I am still finding globs of it everywhere	0
B000EFFS5I:patio_bench:col_wright	The price was right, The bench was larger than I expected which was a nice thing.  It went together easily and works great.  The company does not list measurements on the Amazon web site and I think they would sell more of them through Amazon if they did	1
B0000026RH:their_first_and_best!!:	This 1989 debut album from this Texas sleaze metal outfit is chocked full of great vocals from Jason McMaster,catchy guitar riffs,and generally a collection of feel good tunes about getting drunk and having a good time.It fits quite nicely in my CD collection in the " D" column next to the Dirty Looks CD.I thought "Scared" was the best song on here along with the opener,"Teasin Pleasin" and "Queen of the Nile" but I liked all of them.The best way to describe Dangerous Toys is that it has a heavy Guns N Roses sound with a poppier edge to it.It's too bad they never made a good album after this one and Dangerous Toys would never get to this level again.If you want late 80's hard rock/metal without the spandex and the makeup,this debut album is highly recommended.Nothing fancy,just good old fashioned rock and roll	1

They are trying to force you into 2006 security suite for the big bucks and buggy software.  2005 works fine until I have been thru the runaround 3 times with e-mail customer support.  I won't pay for their telephone customer support, trend micro will force me to buy another brand because of this.  Shame on you pcillin	0

B00004YMJQ:blender?:	collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again	0
B00008MTW2:one_of_paul_newman's_best_movies:p._hale	I love this old Paul Newman movie. The plot is terrific.  The characters and all the family personalities are very realistic. The story taking place down south is refreshing. Paul Newman is very sexy. I highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a Paul Newman fan.	1
B000IGXLZW:great_shoe_with_an_updated_look:samantha	I had been on the look out for a Mary Jane pump that I could wear to work with pants and skirts. I finally found this shoe online and decided to give it a try. Usually Steve Madden's run big on me, so I got a size smaller, and surprisingly, it was actually too small. A half size up did the trick, however.	1

B000CEXNGW:not_what_i_thought_it_was:duke_la_-._probuilt	My nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture.  Unfortunately, the inflatable suit is not really inflatable.  It requires constant air to keep it poofy looking.  It is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower (battery operated) to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated.  The battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit.  Everytime he moves, it pops out.  The fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy, deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him.  He loves superman and loves having a cape.  He opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with.	0

B000IAW2IA:star_trek:__city_on_the_edge_of_forever:kathy_tate	My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.

B00005NKVW:lisa_rinna_&amp;_gail_o'grady_share_the_same_man_(w/o_knowing)!:	Lisa Rinna and Gail O'Grady become best friends..not realizing that they share the same man!  Both women perform very well in this movie...I have been a big fan of both of them since Melrose Place and NYPD Blue.  Sally Kirkland also does a great job in this movie as Gail O'Grady's mother.  This movie is filled with so many different ingredients: intrigue, lessons on overcoming fears, and it helps one become stronger in believing inside what can truly make your life happy.  I've seen it a few times, and enjoy it more each time	1

0875523587:very_encouraging_and_enlightening...:	The author gave many thorough and enlightening illustrations on how communication breaks down &amp; what to look out for. After reading &amp; self-examination, one could identify the areas for  improvement &amp; learn  from the methods prescribed. The first part identifies the types of  relationships within the family. The second on developing God-honouring  relationships, dwelling mainly on the subject of communication. I was very  much enlightened by the types of circuit jammers within the family. Part  three expounds on sustaining Godly family relationships. It explains why  families fight &amp; how to turn discord to concord. I am very much  encouraged &amp; edified from the reading of this book	1

B00000IA9H:for_the_already_faithful_only,_all_others_beware!:james_carragher	Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs	0

B0009V8LR4:lipo_6_-_skip_it:c._seeber_"seebs"	I did get a nice little buzz the first two days I took this product, and it does give you a boost when you take it right before you work out.  You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it	0
B000FIN1WG:outstanding_bag,_it_as_a_place_for_everything_:benjamin_humphrey	We've used this since our baby was born three months ago.  It has a the perfect combination of space for baby accessories as well as your own. It has two small external pockets for extra bottles and a large inside pouch where we keep most of the diapers and larger gear (as well as inside compartments). It also has a small cell phone pocket outside which we use.  The bag is excellent quality and not so large as to be awkward to carry around.  Our baby is still too small to use the convertible sling but I have seen it used on older children.	1
B0002ADECO:best_toiletry_bag_-_no_spilling_of_toiletries_in_your_suitcase!:k._cushmore	Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.	1

B00006699W:this_seems_familiar:sconnie	Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set.  Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played with a normal deck of cards.  If you already know how to play "10 to 1," Xactika may seem derivative.  After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1" instead	1
B00080XGUS:shattered_dreams...:dagashai	It is a very lovely two piece set. And Amazon shipped it to me twice, and both times it arrived in more or less a pile of shards. I gave up, but from what I could tell from the remains, this set is a very nice heavy earthen bakewear. I'm not sure, considering the shipping problems, whether the set could survive normal jostling in storage cabinets or a dishwasher	0
B00008XY4B:fabulous_toy_for_infants:stacy_l._anderson	My daughter received this toy for Christmas and at seven weeks old, immediately loved it. My five-month old nephew also received one and loves it as well. It is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don't hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth. The colors are visually engaging and it has a "nice" rattle sound to it (loud enough to get the child's attention, not too loud to be an annoying toy). I recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift.	1
508052	This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short	0

542839	Before buying a subscription to this magazine I would suggest reading through an issue first, just so you are aware of what you'll be getting. No, it's not anything particularly challenging or mind-provoking, and the articles aren't scholarly or journal-worthy. But.. the articles make the subject accessible to the average reader, and do include insights into human behaviors and relationships that are fun and interesting. I am always engaged reading the articles, and find them topical and very current, unlike some psychology magazines which are too `deep' and drenched in older principles. This is a very `hip' psychology magazine and would be appreciated by those who are not necessarily scholars in the subject but who have a genuine interest in learning more. My favorite part is looking through the recommended books section, because there is usually something worthwhile to read	1
B000IAXVIA:great_classic_for_a_great_price:l._cerny	With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.	1

B00005KIDR:don't_buy!_doesn't_work_well!:k._sin	When we first bought it, it worked nicely and smoothly. Thought we do not need to buy another opener again. Boy were we wrong! After the third use, it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning. Reminds me of a car turning it's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results. Glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand. This opener certainly does damage to the KitchenAid name	0

B00020J16M:perfect_for_cross_country:a._acuna	I've used this model watch for the past three years of my cross-country career and have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's very light and not bulky at all - something every runner looks for in a watch.  Along with that, the interval timer really comes in handy when doing timed work outs or when  simply doing crunches.  The fit is so comfortable and does not cut or chafe.  Also, the battery life is outstanding (+ 1 year).	1

I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version	0

B000A7978Y:invisible_killer:m._ross	After I cracked and ruined my original filter, I purchased a new one that insisted the BioMax inserts were essential to its functionality. Having had my original filter for about 6 years, I decided to follow the instructions about adding BioMax, thinking this was a product upgrade. I was deeply dissapointed. Not only did it create cloudy water, despite my effort to add "clear water" drops to resolve this, but the lifespan of my fish decreased dramatically.  I was losing fish every week.  Once I removed the BioMax insert, the water cleared instantly and my fish started to thrive	0
B000I62M3Y:potential_danger_-_please_be_vigilant:mom_to_3_little_ones	Please be careful and make sure you can see your baby when playing with these keys.  The plastic ring holding the keys can break.  We found the small broken piece in our baby's mouth!  We received this toy only three weeks ago	0
510461	I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.	0
B0006512K6:can't_put_in_dryer:alexa_de_los_reyes_"new_mom"	I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product.	0
B0007ZAJ8G:good_unit_after_you_get_rid_of_the_wimpy_plug:john_ward	this unit works surprisingly well with the following caveats:	1
B0007OSLYG:the_little_shredder_that_could!:j._ramsey	Overall a nice product, powerful, good looking, but with a few quirks.  Feed/auto on mechanism a little picky as to the angle that you insert your paper.  Recommend putting entire unit in a big trash bag when emptying, otherwise shredded bits go flying to the floor.  Make sure to put the lid on the basket in proper orientation or motor won't run; look for the little metal rail on the inside top right of the basket, if it's not there rotate the basket 180 degrees and then put the top on.	1
B00007G314:cute_but_not_safe_for_newborns:andrea_matthiesen	I really love these bumper pads and also the quality after washing is very good. the only thing i don&acute;t like is the way the strings work. there are not enough and also they rip off easily. not stitched well for the price.	1
B00063NW3S:mostly_waterproof,_but_not_for_writing_checks;_not_for_lower-priced_lamys.:s._blackwelder_"fountain_pen_daily_user"	This ink has the ancient "iron gall" formula with its nifty aroma. Iron gall ink is waterproof but not safe enough for writing checks. Iron gall ink looks good from a "wet-writing" pen, but the lower-priced Lamy "Safari" and "Al-Star" pens are not "wet" enough. Also, you should never let iron gall ink dry out in a pen (permanent clogging!), and you should flush an iron-gall-using pen in both directions with plain water (pulling water in and forcing water out) every month or so	0

I am finally ready for a new one and will purchase the SNP once again only this tme I will get the cover to keep the Louisiana rain away from it.  I BBQ year round and love the results I get with my pit.heat control seem simple for me I leave the smoke stack open full and the air vent open only a sliver and the heat stays around 200-220.  I would say invest in a charcoal starter for adding coals and wood in the middle of a BBQ session that way you do not get lighter fluid taste on you meat the person trying to do steaks and pork chops I sugest ya grill those in the fire boxand bbq your larger cuts of meat.   ALL and ALL this was a GREAT purchase and you will not be sad ya spent the bucks for this one :o)	1
B00061I4YW:great_for_the_true_star_wars_fan!:alstrooper	If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan.  I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable.  The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck.  Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong	1
B000CEGY04:interesting_toy:b._e_jackson	This is one interesting toy!  I love the way it creates music when it floats on top of the water!  You can even create music for it, which is something I've never thought would be possible.  Kids today have it made!	1
B0007DHU0S:love_it!!:l._falkenstein	My three year old takes a "rest" instead of a nap, which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity.  He can't tell time, so he would come out every 5 minutes to see if rest time was over.  In order to keep him in there for an hour I purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up.  It works perfectly and he isn't anxious about when his time is up.  He understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up. I set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out. No more "is it time yet?".  I get my full hour of sanity uninterupted!	1
602270	Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited.	0
B00004D3EJ:just_okay...:s._osborne_"problemcat"	This is a nice idea, but the individual components are poor in quality. The nasal aspirator doesn't get enough suction. Of course, I've never found an aspirator at the store that did work as well as the one we got from the hospital. Do yourself a favor and just ask for an extra one before you're discharged from the hospital. Second, the thermometer takes FOREVER to get a reading, and it doesn't beep or anything to let you know it's finished. The clippers are okay, but I've definitely used better ones that were just a buck or two. Never used the medicine dropper because the pharmacy gives you one for free when you get a prescription, and other baby medications (Tylenol, Motrin, PediaCare, etc) come with their own specially calibrated dispensers. The medicine spoon? Give me a break. My daughter balked at that one the one time I did try to use it	0

562248	I have been slogging through this book for weeks now, it was a terrible shock to the system after John Julius Norwich's excellent book on Byzantium.  The book lacks any narrative thrust, often stopping and retreading events slightly out of chronological order and frequently bringing all forward motion to a halt by describing the intricacies of some bureaucratic office or another.  The one consistent thing throughout this book is the author's obvious agenda to "set the record straight" and prove that the Ottoman empire was far superior to its "barbaric" European contemporaries	0

B00006HBUG:awesome_movie__marred_by_poorly_written_dialogue:princessmars09_"raye"	We all love George Lucas for creating the Star Wars Universe and introducing us to some of the best characters in movie history but lets face reality here, the man cannot write dialogue to save his life.  In the OT it wasn't as noticeable because the plot was not very complicated and the scenes were very straightforward, the foundation was already there.  The PT has to lay that foundation which George Lucas fails at.	1

I can't write &quot;highly recommended&quot; about this book, because it seems to trivialise those horrible events to some marchendising event. Just read it, you may not be able to sleep for few nights, but you'll get a true look into the mirror of evil regimes, supported by the United States only because they were &quot;anti-communist&quot;	1

B000A3BDOO:white_screen:valerie	Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!	0
B00070QECQ:this_is_a_great_cap!:m._lu	I'm on my 5th cap now I think.  Silicone is great and lasts forever.  Unlike rubber (which can snag hair) and latex (which some people are allergic to) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair, has a glossy finish so it looks great and doesn't lose elasticity. I have a some advice if you want to try this product that I've learned overt the years:	1
415317	I was really looking forward to getting this tool and saving some time.  It sorely disappointed me.  It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.   It seems like a good idea, but I guess I'll have to make my own to get it  to work right	0

This year has been an especially bad cold and flu season for this area and I have been exposed to all of it but, knock on wood, I've been the healthiest one in the family and at work (and the only one drinking this stuff). So go figure? There are too many things good about this tea to not try it	0
B000EI06KM:even_at_a_discount_price_not_worth_the_money:adling_clan	We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel	0
495754	This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano	0
306533	I bought this card about 10 months ago to go with my Nikon D70 and I've certainly had no regrets.

I highly recommend it for teachers who are interested in giving students a broaded understanding of deaf culture and also something that will really spark classroom debate and interest	1
5590	I read this book many, many years ago on a very long flight.  I couldn't put it down.  The philosophy is simple; live frugally, save/invest money every month, and you too can be a millionaire.  It's great advice, especially in this day and age when the younger generation wants the big house, expensive car, and everything else right NOW, with no regard to the future.  Although some of the info is dated (Enron being named as a great company to invest), and some other advice (putting new soles on old shoes) is a bit much, the general message makes plenty of sense.	1
B000KPWC1K:casio_watch:rudolph_w._brondsema	I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler.

It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it	0

B000A33B0S:deep_fryer_-_safety_hazard?:k._beeson	We purchased the DeLonghi based on its ease of cleaning (4 of 5 parts can be placed in the dishwasher).  After the third use, the plastic part that holds the heating element in place MELTED off the base.  DeLonghi service was apologetic, and promised to send a replacement part ASAP, although the part was out of stock.  That was in September, almost 6 months ago.  Parts are still backordered!  I returned the unit to Lowes in frustration, got a new unit, and it too melted on the First use.  Returned it for credit.  Do not consider this unit.	0

B000063XJP:not_the_threads_magazine_of_the_past:p._collins	I used to dream about subscribing to Threads and drool over them in the library, but the new format beginning in Fall 2005 is disappointing.  They have added many more articles of interest to very new sewers such as how to choose the correct needle for a fabric.  This basic info is readily available in many basic sewing books and it is not why I renewed to Threads for another 3 years.  This magazine once showed cutting edge techniques and lots of projects that intermediate and advanced sewers could savor.  As a beginning sewer I used to dream about conquering the exciting projects in Threads.  Now, they have watered it down to appeal to less skilled people at the expense of the projects and information that made it stand out from other sewing magazines.  This is still a "good" magazine, but no longer excellent.  I wish that I could get back my money for the next 3 years and spend it on fabric	1

424447	This isn't your typical run through game, you actually have to think and take risk at times. It does get a little difficult as stated in alot of reviews but that's the thing I like most about it. I rate this just as good as Jedi Academy. My only flaws were the default controls, those were a pain. I highly recommend changing that and the force powers were a pain to use at first but once you got used to it it wasn't that bad. This has a decent story line as all the Star Wars games do and fun to play. I had to use a few cheat codes on some of the levels (like Level Skip)because it gets pretty tough, but I didn't have to do that much, maybe twice. Anyways, this is a definately must have for all the Star Wars fans out there.	1

B000HAQ8EK:i_really_wanted_to_love_this_camera...:blonde_girl	My primary use for this camera was to take pictures indoors with very bright lighting, without the use of a flash. The camera couldn't handle taking pictures without the flash at all, despite it being extremely bright in the room (5 different lights on plus 3 overhead halogen track lights). The camera's shutter speed was so slow that it was nearly impossible to get a picture that wasn't blurry. Maybe 1 in every 4 pictures came out clear. I believe the fact that its a 10 megapixel camera is what did it.	0

At the end of every issue there were pictures of &quot;real-life&quot; wedding announcements.  Perhaps this is fitting for your local newspaper, but it struck me as out of place in a magazine	0
155434	The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*	1
B000K0QZY0:did_not_like_this_swing:c_slovak_"mom_of_three_boyz"	I tried this swing then this Fisher-Price's Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around	0
B0000C5GCV:versaflex_is_a_joy_to_use!:neplusultra	I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!	1

B000BGJLBC:happy_soldier:larry_summons_"bmore-soldier"	I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up	1
B0000AXJQH:incredible_stuff!:d._mcallister_"mrd"	I recall first hearing about Bag Balm at an adult Scout Leader training retreat.  One of the participants started talking about Bag Balm and how he used it for everything from burns to lip balm.  Needless to say, I was intrigued and, upon returning from the retreat, did a little more investigating.	1
B00021E42M:finally_an_adult_acne_treatment_that_works:e._shaklee	I can't even begin to explain how much I love this product.   Although teen age acne is long gone for me, like most women at that certain time of the month, I get a little flair up here and there.   This product is great.   Totally takes the red out and I say speeds the healing process as well.  I found it it made them disappear over night if I dabbed it on there a few times a day and esp when I saw the begingings of one.   Ones I caught early on never really turned into full blown acne.  Yes it's pricey but I think it's worth every penny.	1
B0000X63LM:difficult_and_inaccurate:tracy	I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back	0
B00004W1TQ:watch_how_you_shop:jacquline_k._pimentel	I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines.  I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate.  I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline.  When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part.  I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit.  I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate.  I am very disapointed	0
6305814724:martin's_best_western:terence_allen	Dino made a number of Westerns, everything from the comic Western Pardners with Jerry Lewis, to a whodunit Western, Five Card Stud with Robert Mitchum, to playing an alcoholic lawman in Rio Bravo. But Martin had a field day playing the villain in Rough Night In Jericho, a hard-bitten, violent movie.	1
103630	umm...I don't think you quite got the point of this album. It is not about the artists that you like, it is about the artists that inspired Moore. Your ignorance forces me to do nothing but laugh. I find it funny that you feel you are making a point by saying "F*ck you SOAD" and so on. Have some respect for other's opinions. Unfortunately, you are a steriotypical "ignorant American".So with all that said, and with all due respect, I say, F*ck you pal	1

B000FT7NYC:very_nice_crib_-_good_price:danielle	I'm really pleased with this crib.  The price was right and it arrived within a matter of days.  Shipping and handling costs were very low.  A few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow.  Otherwise, it looks great and is very sturdy.  Great crib for the price	1
B000FUL3HE:beautiful_watch:mimi_"theater_lover"	This is a very nice watch. The pink mother-of-pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft. The date is a little small but the watch is so nice that I didn't even care. The only complaint I have is that Amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside. I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo	1
B000DZS720:perfect_for_tiny_babies!:mandy_"mandisita"	My son is tiny- born at 5lbs 6oz and very much a preemie. I simply cannot imagine putting him in the infant seat without this. It keeps his entire body in place- not just his head. It provides great support and the soft white fuzzy side is very warm (we havnt used the other side yet.)	1
B000EOOZLM:love_'em:l._lewis	So far, these fit the bill. Just used them for the first time--find that they are easy to put on, and comfortable--and better yet, don't interfere with jewelry as they would if they hung off a chain/rope/string	1
B000639LJC:what_a_perfect,_simple_toy:l._ballard_"captainlarab"	This is a great doll--we gave it to our 2-year-old daughter last week and she now carries her everywhere, feeds her, reads to her, puts her to bed, covers her with a blanket, and obsessively pats her on the back and tush.  She's quite cuddly and soft; you'll want to hold her yourself.  You might expect from the pictures that the arms and legs would be hard plastic like the head, but in fact they are very soft and pliable, and the trunk of the body is all cloth, like a pillow, with a bean-bag tushie.  The headband is removable but actually stays on there pretty well.  The eyes don't have those stupid eyelids you usually see on baby dolls, the ones that open and shut when you lift the doll, and that always seem to stop working properly after a couple of weeks.  We'll see how "Maria" holds up to the kind of punishment our daughter can mete out, but she seems pretty durable.  What a great purchase!	1

B000BMEYFO:i_never_got_it.:crystal_d._herrera	Well the women that was selling this product decided that after she had already sold me this car seat that she was'nt makeing any money off of it, so she decided not to sell it to me.   So I never got this car seat. I really don't understand why I need to write a review on it	0
B000HAB4S0:movie_is_great,_but_unbox_is_uncooked:james_k._hurd_"old_fella"	Movie got 2/3 through and just quit. No problem, this is Windows right? Just reboot and start where you left off. Only for whatever reason I can't restart this movie from anywhere but the beginning. I'm not going to watch this moving over from the beginning just to see if it fails in the same place again. Only a couple bucks, but definitely not worth it	0
B000AY8DDW:beware!_*custom*_cartridges_are_not_full!:photogold	There is a reason that the value pack is so much cheaper.  The cartridges are not full!  I just got off the phone with HP tech support and they confirmed this.  The cartridges sold with the value pack are labeled as *custom* cartridges that have enough ink to print 150 4X6 photos.  In fact, the tech support rep discribed the *custom* cartridges as having "way less" than standard cartridges, "less than 50% full".  On a related note, I asked him if the initial cartridges that came with my  new printer were full, and he said they should have been full standard cartridges.	0

401397	Im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from Visio to Logic Audio to MS Office.  After picking up Illustrator however, Im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers.  Ive been told that the world revolves around 2 types of people: those who "get" vector graphic programs, and those who errrr...dont. Unfortunately, after 10 hours use and much manual reading, I fall into the later category. I dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course. This decision was supported by friends proficient in its use - but who had difficulty demonstrating the  complex concepts to me. (Indeed, defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science!)	0
B000A0FXIO:terrible_company:joshua_abrams	The clock is great. My son has one from Discovery Store and loves it and it does a lot of things well. I bought one for my nephew through this Amazon link and they never sent it. My inquiry generated an email that everyone in their company was fired for doing a bad job and we would get a credit!! Discovery's price is higher but it is still a good deal for $30 and at least you actually get the clock	0
204263	Okay, I'll admit. I bought into the hype.  Oooo, no "sulfates"...  Oooo, "essential water"....   Oooo, "all natural" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - "vegan" shampoo and conditioner...	0
B0002LY9E0:terrible_sandals!:christopher_w._damico_"macman"	THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS	0
B0005XNERS:camping_tradition_at_its_best:j._corsi	What do you think of foodwise when you go camping? well besides the case of beer, you have the dogs and the marshmallows! Nothing like roasting these suckers over an open fire, or just pop them in your mouth from the bad. Soft, and fluffy, these suckers don't get hard and stale as quickly as other brands do. Definately a great product	1
472308	I wish I had something good to say but I ordered this Barron's subscription back in August 06. I've had this newspaper before and do enjoy it.  It is now November and I'm still waiting.  I called customer service and Amazon promised to resolve but that was several weeks ago. My next call will be to ask for my money back. Hopefully this isn't happening to other Subscribers.  I've ordered several other magazines from Amazon and always received them on a timely basis.	0
569071	Truly frightening, gruesome, a gore-fest, a bloodbath, AND it has a plot... really, there are a lot of clich expressions to describe this movie but they're all true: It's a HORROR movie in the true sense of the word.	1

B0008GJQY2:biosilk_leave-in_conditioner:ducky	Until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  It made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  But lately something has changed. The once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  It's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  Don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back	0

B000FTHLIA:not_what_i_had_in_mind....:winter_m._wilson_"med1"	This is a nice case, however, i needed something more sleek and small to fit into my purse when i go out with my friends. This case is bulky and my Panasonic FXO1 would fit into something much smaller. I ended up going with a great case that i found at Wal-Mart for a cheeper price, sleeker design, small enough to hold my memory cards and camera and still fit into the small purses i take when i go out on the town	0
B00081H73E:perfect_for_once_baby_sits_up:lydia's_mommy	I can't find on this website the exact tub I bought for my daughter, but this tub looks most like it.  I tried using a baby tub that converts to sitting up to be placed in the big bath tub, but that didn't work at all.  The small inflatable tub is definately the way to go.  My daughter can splash and wiggle and not get hurt or uncomfortable at all.  It is a pain to blow the tub up, but our tub has a little hole to hang on a hook, so we just constantly keep it inflated and hanging on the tub wall.  My daughter is nearly 1 year old now, and has been using this tub for about 5 months.  There is still plenty of room for her to grow and I think she'll be using this tub for awhile.  I feel she is safer in it than if she were placed directly into the big tub	1
B0001WGIBW:good_first_step_to_expansion,_good_value_(relatively):my_3_sons	This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.	1
B000BUJP6Y:great_goggles_/_great_price:g._krage	I have been buying this brand of prescription goggles for at least 10 years. The price has been gradually coming down each year. I was surprised to find them so reasonably priced at Amazon of all places. These fit well, adjust easily and are extremely durable. I swim 6 days each week and I can easily get over a year of use from each pair. Typically the gaskets begin to deteriorate long before the lenses, when used daily outdoors in chlorinated pools. Keep them stored safely so the lenses don't scratch and rinse them in clear water after swimming and you'll be thoroughly satisfied with your purchase	1

463387	On the surface, it's just another plain notebook. Not much to look at, really. But there is something magical about the Moleskine. I can honestly say that this pocketsize notebook has increased my creativity, simply by being there to hold whatever I choose to put on its blank pages.	1

B00012BSU8:awesome_crib_set,_awesome_price.:l._k._crews	I wanted this set since I saw it in Babies-r-us, but it was so much more expensive. This is perfect for my new baby girl. I always loved Hello Kitty and I hope she will too. Also, there are many cute accessories that you can purchase with this set. The lamp, rug, and mobile are a must! =) The set comes with only one window valance, and as my nursery has 2 windows, I had to purchase an additional valance. Just something to keep in mind when buying this	1

B00023RDNC:delicious!:a._jensen	We were thrilled to find an online source for wagashi mochi desserts. We love Japanese desserts but because we don't live in New York or California we have a very hard time getting our hands on any. So when we found these we ordered right away. They arrived promptly and well packaged and tasted absolutely wonderful. Though a bit pricy after adding the speedy shipping they really were wonderful. It's not too hard to make plain old daifuku but when you crave the fancier stuff this is the way to go.	1

319836	This is Hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math.  While still not an easy read, it it much easier than the BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME that he wrote for laypeople before this.  A person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book, as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field.  Older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth	1
577605	If you're a Strummer fan who is an historical completist then you'll want this disc.   Also, there are some really good tunes on here for anyone, particularly Joe's "Keys to Your Heart".  Some of the live material here is high quality and some is not.  This is likely not a CD you will listen to over and over again as you would artists who are fresh.  But, I'm just glad this finally appeared on disc as I've always wanted to hear it and as a Joe fanatic, I had to have it.  There's moments here that sound like a rough draft of JS and the Mescaleros, but also moments of pure rock 'n roll circa mid 70's with some great guitar solos.  If Joe had not been where UK punk started after this band there's no telling what he would have done but you can be sure he'd have kept playing in a band.  I'm a huge Clash and Strummer fan, but I rate this 4 stars more for its historical significance than for the actual quality and uniqueness of the content	1

B0002OQGAC:lovely,_but_poor_color_quality:l._m.	These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0
B0002ZZPAS:nice_features_but_very_unreliable:a._easton_"farmer_dude"	I bought this phone for the great features and because I've had good luck with other Motorola products. The phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have. The handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit. The only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings. Range on the handsets is only mediocre, I can't talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located. Also, battery life is very limited. Overall the phones are very disappointing and I would definitely recommend not buying them.	0

B000225ZJM:no_magic_potion:phyllis_le_chat	My husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  I have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  As far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  I used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  At a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., I got skunked	0
B0006U64UO:bad_safety_key_design.:h._li	When one trips the safety key, one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again. This action looses all the time and distance information. The Keys Fitness, who manufactures Ironman and a bunch of others, help line confirmed that this is normal for their products. I see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body	0
B000GF04Q4:zap:babiche	It doesn't zap the yap of our newly adopted Pomeranian mix.  Although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it, but it didn't slow her down much.  We did everything according to directions, and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact.  We have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well.  I'm disappointed with this bark collar though	0
177348	I was really looking forward to getting this tool and saving some time.  It sorely disappointed me.  It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.   It seems like a good idea, but I guess I'll have to make my own to get it  to work right	0
B0006NF894:not_what_it's_hyped_to_be:callamatisse	For me, it barely looked like I had mascara on at all.  I have blonde eyelashes, so even adding color usually makes my eyes pop, and this didn't really.  I ended up giving it to my mom, thinking that maybe it was just me since so many others loved it, and she didn't like it either.  It ended up in the garbage.  I've loved Dior Show mascara and of course, Great Lash.  I'd recommend those over this, especially for the money	0
170102	With the Wii right around the corner, people are rushing to get one. Some preordered it while some others (including me) are camping out for it. But some worry about how old school is fitting into the next-gen world of gaming and its completely wireless interaction. Sure, sideways Wii controllers are S/NES controllers, but what of gamecubes? I am happy to say that I have gotten a chance to play around with the Wii before anyone else. And yes, the wavebird Receiptor will fit flawlessly under the gamecube controller flap on the Wii. It looks pefectly at home there. Rejoice gamers! Pick up your wavebirds and play on	1
178520	As always, the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint.  Personally, I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams, if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going, and to tour the rest of the town.  I must admit, I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn't have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose, but hey, it's nice to see they have a penchant for detail.  After all, what town doesn't have a Courthouse? heh.	1
B000A2GSWW:melodic,_furious,_melodic_again.:tk	Well, this isn't At the Gates.  Nightrage reminds me of many old Arch Enemy guitar tunes that were so melodic.  Of course, that leads into Gus G. substituting Chris on concerts being an excellent choice, as they make very similar melodies.  Some people say this album is heavy, which it is in some parts.  But its melodic death, there are no signs of thrash or anything.  Just great melodies, great headbanging music.  Add this to your collection, I think its better than Sweet Vengeance	1
B00004RBTK:not_for_serious_chinese_cook!:chinese_wife	I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all	0
26328	Nobody, and I mean NObody, could be more of an Illustrator novice & ignoramus than I. Several months ago I was given a licensed copy of Illustrator 9 that a departing coworker had used. Wanting a chance to design the departmental logo that otherwise would've gone to an agency, I raised my figurative hand and volunteered blindly for duty. Having taught myself everything from MS-DOS to TurboCAD, to Photoshop Elements, not to mention Word, Excel, and Powerpoint (don't get me started on that latter program, argh), I figured I could tackle at least the basics of Illustrator 9. Loaded it on my laptop, took it home for a weekend....and just about lost my sanity -- and several fingernails -- trying to learn that confounding program. I managed to produce a few logos, one of which was chosen. But egads, what a big, stinky bear Illustrator 9 was to wrestle.	1
B000DT87W6:does_exactly_what_it's_supposed_to:fersal_"fersal"	All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.	1
B000006RHM:justified!:j._k._richter	Maiden had evolved into a new metal standard in 1986. Not only did they lead the metal world with the greatest artwork on covers, but their music took a new form and justifed everything they had done in the past. Iron Maiden to Powerslave were just the stepping stones to this standard classic.	1
B00097A4UU:not_your_average_screen_protector:t._j._kramer_"competent_reviewer"	These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.	1
105312	This album is incredible.  For me this is one of those few albums that defines a time in my life.  An album that for months I played over and over.  An album that I've played countless times, that I have passed out to when I came home after a late night, that I have ran to, and worked out to, that I play at work for a pick-me up.  It's great.  It's filled with so much emotion and passion, from beginning to end its just brilliant, the entire album.  The songs are composed more like classical music with sweeping scores that start off slow and steady and then build up and explode into these intense jams.  I love it.  You have to buy this album.  Then buy their next self titled album.  Then play it and play it, and play it.  It grows on you.  I can't wait to see them live...	1
B0002CZYIY:superb_vocal_workhorse:bruce_butler_"ga_gandalf"	This microphone is an excellent choice for garage bands, home-recorders and musical enthusiasts--ultra reliable, extremely tough with sound reproduction of a quality which usually requires a much heftier price tag. This is a microphone that will keep you singing a good while.	1
454525	I've found the recipes here generally simple and easy to make ahead.  Mrs. Burros is very clear in her instructions (although I had some problems with a chocolate roll)and the taste combinations are very good.  As this book is an update of her original there are a number of amusing asides on changes in food ingredients and cooking styles between the two editions.  Not quite a &quot;must-have&quot; but useful	1
B0007VB4IY:looks_nice_and_does_the_job!:~b	I love this watch!  It's easy to use.  It's also a very basic watch.  It gives your heart rate, zone and calories burned.  It's very nice for what it is supposed to do.  If you're looking for a watch with a lot of bells and whistles, this is not the one for you.  It looks nice and it's not too bulky.  The only reason I would have gotten the F6 is because it says it has something that prevents "cross talk" (interference with others wearing a heart monitor watch.  There are three of us where this same exact watch in my cycling class and we've never had a problem with "cross talk."  As the other reviews said, there is no backlight.  Would recommend	1
B000EONGH6:u.s._divers_proflex_ii_diving_fins_:dj_"dkj"	We purchased 4 sets of fins and masks for a trip to Jamaica. We were very happy with the US Divers product. The price was right and the fins worked just as expected. They worked just as good as sets we have rented. Rather than renting fins at the beach, we now have sets to use the next time we travel to the ocean	1
312141	The title of this movie holds no secrets. The Virgin suicides may have its up and downs throughout the movie but the whole time the viewer is left with an impending sense of doom. Almost every aspect of this movie is fantastic, between the acting and a great story line, but this movie is truly dramatic in that it will no doubt influence your emotions	1

B000J4HUSC:dissapointed:rnatch_"rnatch"	The concept was great. But after only a month or so, flaws started showing. The inserts started bending and warping, seperating at the edges and cracking. I purchased them for my Mother who gave them to my Daughter as a gift. She loved the idea, but will go back to the wooden boards because I don't think these will be around long. And they were not cheap either	0

331839	If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.	1
B0006JKE7O:not_impressed:sushi_jane	I was very disappointed in this mirror.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all.	0

B0007D0UI2:hours_of_entertainment!!:mickey_fanatic_"mom_of_2_girls"	I just bought this yesterday and surprised my girls (3 and 5)  with it today.  It does blow tons of bubbles!  They love chasing them all over the yard.  The Gazillion bubble solution that comes with it is cool because the bubbles are really colorful when they come out.  It does used 8 AA batteries as previously mentioned but there is an order from inside to send away for an adaptor.  Yes, it has a plug for an adaptor to plug it in so you don't use so many batteries.  Where I'll plug it in in the backyard I'm not sure yet.  I definitely recommend for the young children that are so excited by bubbles	1
B000E46IU8:really_cheapy:d._wright_"new_grandma"	I ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up "big people food" for my grandson.  It could not even grind up a soft hot dog!  We kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material (painted gray to look like metal!) it just couldn't do the job.  Sheesh, I mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder.  Total waste of money.  Also, my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two.  Junk	0

1419333402:over_the_top:g._ware_cornell_jr._"another_lawyer"	When John Grisham introduced us to Bendini, Lambert & Locke, a Memphis tax boutique controlled by the Mafia, the idea of an in-house firm for the mob was hilarious. These days no one, least of all our hero Scott Finn, is particularly sure that organized crime doesn't just control the firm, but also the governor's office, the US Attorneys Office and the Boston PD.	1

B000BIZEXO:good_quality_and_fast_delivery:robert_w._carter	I was really pleased with the quality of this patio table.  It was shipped immediately and we received it in less than 5 days after ordering.  As others have commented, the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table I ordered.  I had to buy additional screws at Home Depot, four in total.  The missing instructions, for the table ordered, were not really needed, it was simple enough to put together without instructions.  All tools needed were included with the shipment.  Had I not needed to purchase additional screws, I would have given this product 5 STARS	1
B000EIRFO2:tiny_but_strong!:holly_pixley	When they say tiny, that isn't an understatement.  You can hardly see these, when they are holding items to the fridge.  They do work well, I used two however to hold a postcard (so that it wouldn't swing).  They are stong, but count on two per item to make sure that papers don't slip.  Overall, great product, but don't be suprized when you get them and say, "that's it?"	1

B0000UJKTC:coffee_in_a_fun_cup:b._e_jackson	What people don't think about is how hot chocolate works just as well as coffee in a coffee mug.  I'm not a coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate in it.  I have to take a point off because after you pour coffee in this mug enough times a permanent smell is left there, which means using this cup for anything other than coffee or hot chocolate is gross.  Especially water.  Who wants to take a sip of water only to smell coffee every time you put the mug to your face?  Not me.  Not that the smell of coffee is horrible or anything.  It smells good and I can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people in my home are making some.	1

Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh.  They are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price for 3 boxes.	1
B0009HG9G8:finally_found_a_stovetop_espresso_maker_made_of_stainless_steel...:luis_re	I love this little coffee maker.  I have always been partial to the stovetop espresso makers but I have never been very comfortable brewing or cooking with aluminum.  This maker is made from stainless steel, which is more expensive, but for me it's worth it (as it will probably last a lifetime.)  It makes a very good cup of coffee and I'm very happy with it.	1

528463	I just picked up one of these for my Motorola Cell Phone.  It has more than enough volume.  It comes with both a right and left ear adapter.  Fits pretty good and I have medium sized ears. Its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it.  It is very comfortable though. If you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset.	1

B00005N5WX:very_reliable.:"rod-zilla"	I've had my Cobra 29 for over five years now. It's been in four different trucks, and traveled over 500,000 miles with me. Once I added two wilson antennas and a power mic, I can get out over four miles on a good night. My personal record is a line of sight 130 miles from a mountainside. I love it.

B00032B9CS:good,_but_extremely_unhealthy.:miss_congeniality_"frequent_amazon_buyer"	I personally LOVE crunchy cheetos, but if you look at the nutrition facts they're not really that healthy. I love the crunch and the cheesiness. Everything about cheetos are great, I even love to lick the cheese off of my fingers. Although the fat, salt, calorie, and carbohyrdrate content are EXTREMELY terrible, the package may say 100% real chese, but its 100% real FAKE cheese. It's like everyone loves chocolate, but it's unhealthy.	1
B000B628OE:i_have_never_seen_a_game_like_this_ever_before.__it's_so_intelligent!!!_:trish_l.	First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary	1
560250	Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch.

B000BAWLS8:norton_system_works_destroys_my_computer:randall_j._bowerman	I recently tried to update my Norton Systemworks.  Halfway through the update, I got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old Norton Systemworks.  I tried to back out of the installation at that point, but was unable.  I called the Norton company, spent an hour on the phone with a tech, only to have them tell me it was my computer.  I assured them that I was just using my computer, which was fine, and now it doesn't work.  They told me there was nothing further that they could do, and that I would have to call a computer service company.  I found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system, causing me to lose everything on my hard drive, and requiring a new operating system.  I have run into other people who had exactly the same problem, with no help from the Norton Company.  I will never again buy a Norton product.  I only wish I could get my money back from them.	0

Instead I received a magazine that discusses political issues. Does the magazine know what it wants to be? They recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands. Why would they if they're becoming a political magazine?

The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos.

172364	During my teenage years I was a fan of WWF wrestling and specifically, the Rock.  He was a tremendous wrestler who the fans admired right away because of his talent to be extremely funny on the microphone and cut some of the funniest, most disgusting lines ever mentioned on WWF TV.  His talent in the ring was spot-on, and the Rock would always give the people everything he had when it came time to step in the ring and compete.  He rarely made a mistake in the ring... but he made a HUGE mistake stepping away from wrestling and walking down the path to Hollywood.	0

CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it.

B00005IASH:wonderful_satire_of_post-war_england:bomojaz	One of the first of the great Ealing comedies, and a clear indication that their comedies would carry social and political weight as well. In this picture a run-down section of London discovers a horde of burried treasure when a bomb left over from WW II explodes accidentally, and the residents of Pimlico, London, learn that they actually are a part of Burgandy, as deeded by the King in the 1400s. This means they are a separate country right in the heart of London, and they decide to act like a separate country. Thus they conclude that the laws of England don't apply anymore - but likewise England cuts them off, and Pimlico is under siege.	1

182716	I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one.	0
218035	Although the real roots lie with the black artists who inspired these guys, the PBBB is where the hippy generation,(this is a couple years pre-San Francisco, and before the Stones and Beatles began stretching their arrangements out on record),learned to JUST PLAY. Their next record was more representative of what they were actually doing live at time time, and is the single greatest influence on what became the San Francisco sound of the late 60's and early 70's, (REALLY long and experimental jamming), so this is in fact the &quot;roots of the roots of the roots&quot; of todays jam bands and guitar-heavy blues bands, mixed-race bands, and, for all practical purposes, the white-blues-man in todays' world	1
B0002HL0EG:could've_been_less_flawed:sotheavy	i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from, they have very large, very visible flaws.  i know the color and clarity were posted on the website, but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair?  people won't notice anything without taking a good close-up look, though; and like i said, i still love to wear them despite the quality	0

Audrey Hepburn is my favorite all time actor/actress and she (Joanna in this) is brilliant as always. However, Albert Finney's roll (Mark), charactor and performance is in stark contrast. The further the movie goes the more I disliked Mark and was angry that Joanna was putting up with him. Mark's charactor is over the top and unbeliveable. Five stars Audrey, minus four Albert	0
26667	The magazines ordered through amazon take an ETERNITY to be delivered.  The estimated time for my delivery was April after I had placed the order in Feb.  That's a long enough wait as it is---I ended up receiving it the the end of June!  And when I called to complain...the customer service rep explained to me that it was technically within the estimated allowed time for delivery.  so bottom line...if you have an urge to order a magazine that may take half a year or so to get to you...then this is the ONE FOR YOU-hands down.  I plan on never ordering a single magazine through Amazon again.  Definitely don't send a subscription to anyone as a birthday gift- it'll maybe make it in time for the FOLLOWING birthday year..so plan years in advance	0
0471433349:too_wordy:mathgineer	This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses.  I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately.  Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples.  Of course, examples are very important.  However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products).  They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor.  Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them.  Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail.  My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem.  I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote.	0

However, I needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things, such as alterations and heavy sewing.  I'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine.  The needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread.  Also, the food feed stalls, jerks and surges.  This machine has beautiful stitches, but is for lightweight sewing only	0
B0002EO78K:do_not_waste_your_money:g._salazar_"gigi"	I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy	0
B0002OQGA2:lovely,_but_poor_color_quality:l._m.	These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!	0

B000GE77XS:take_a_miss_on_these_earbuds:donna_trivison	I wanted some earbuds for my Zen player which fit in my ears and wouldn't fall out. These earbuds did fit my ears. However, a month after starting to use them one channel went out and now I have sound coming out of only one earbud. Also, I have no idea why these are called, "high quality" earbuds, unless it was a sales tactic. The sound quality is not as good as the sound of the original Zen earbuds. I am back to using the original buds, but I'm $20 lighter in the pocketbook. I was dissatisfied with this purchase	0
521945	I purchased the canon powershot s500 digital elph last March. I kept getting blurry pictures so I called Canon technical support. They went through the whole procedure to make sure my camera was all set up. Well I followed their directions but everything was the way it should have been. So they said I should send it in because there was obviously a problem with it. Then I sent it in and had to pay for the shipping there. They sent it back and said they had switched out some optical thing. Well I just finally went to get my pictures developed and they all have the same problem. They never fixed the problem. Mind you this was the approximately 9 months of my son's life before the age of 2. I called tech support and ended up having to wait more than 24 hours for a call back from a supervisor. She said they would send me pre paid envelope to check out the camera. Well I was greatful and had to tell her that during babysitting in late August a little boy had dropped my camera so there was damage to the outside part of the camera, but it did not effect the quality of the pictures because they were the same as prior to the day it was dropped. She said that they would probably not cover it due to the fact that it might have been caused by the dropped camera. I told I have proof of when it happened and that the pictures prior to that date are coming in blurry just like it was before I sent it in the first time. I started to cry that my son's 9 months are all ruined and she was practically laughing when I got off the phone. The camera is worse than a disposable camera. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk. I recommend Olympus. My Olympus prior to this was only 3 megapixels and was better quality than this piece of junk. I am planning on contacting the Better Business Bureau regarding this matter. Please don't waste your time on this, like I have to! I hope this helps people make better choices! Good luck! I wish someone could have forecasted this for me	0

Since she was brought home my daughter has enjoyed looking about and being held so she can see all around her. She was bored to tears (literally) every time we put her in the lounger (the baby faces the ceiling.. not too exciting).  I thought it was a cool concept, however, my daughter did not.  She did much better in her papasan, or bouncy seat where she could nap if she wanted to, but have the option to look around and play as well.  Looking up at the ceiling was not fun for my daughter	0
B000KLNQW8:annoying_to_use:j._dahl	Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.

Until now, I've never had a recorder that could pick up everything without a lot of background noise or without having to turn the tape over or replace it in the midst of the event. This little Sony is the perfect size, picks up everything without all that background noise and plays it back crystal clear. Additionally, it has a long battery life, and I never run out of room while I'm taping. I couldn't ask for more	1

B00003ZACK:good_in_theory:"fcwalsh"	This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	0
172305	I read Successful Farming, Progressive Farming and Backwoods Home for years.  They are all fine magazines.  But if you want to do a little hobby farm this magazine really fits.  They have a wealth of information in each copy.  I'm really impressed.  It's really targeted to those people who have five to thirty acres, a few animals and may or may not want to make a little money on this side or as minimum have fun but do it the right way.  My first copy was their tractor issue.  Very good info.  And I'm an engineer	1
324427	When you subscribe to the Wall Street Journal it's like getting two newspapers:  a good news reporting paper and an what at times seems like an editorial page written by sophmomores in the local Young Americans for Freedom college rag.  It's not that I mind right-wing editorials, I'm somewhat of a libertarian myself, it's just that its editorial page puts ideology ahead of reason far too often for my taste.  For a much better deal  -- business news, all the financial quotes, much better international coverage, and excellent and concise reporting -- choose the Financial Times.  At the moment an annual subscription is selling for $50.  It's a much better publication and on Saturday's has a very fine weekend section with good book reviews and arts and culture coverage.  Also because the FT is based out of London the editors are much more balanced and less cowed or ideologically obedient.  Even if they were similarly priced the FT would be the better deal.  As it is the FT costs a fraction of the price of the WSJ.	0
6304989210:anitra_ford_really_only_movie_star_performance:gary_dibert_"the_wessel"	The only reason I bought this movie, because it had Anitra Ford in it. Pam Grier plays the role of Blossom, Anitra Ford plays the role of Terry and Sid Haig plays the role of Djanglo. Terry is invite to go to a small tavern in town where Blossom is singing. While their Blossom and here thugs try to rob the place. Terry is taken hostage by Djanglo and thrown in a getaway car. When the local police catch up with the car Djanglo jumps over the bridge leaving Terry to fend for herself. Despite her innocents, Terry is sentence to life on a Government work farm known as the Big Bird Cage. When Blossom tries to take at the local politicians. She is also sentence to the work farm. There Blossom, Terry and Djanglo who's undercover as a Warden Guard get together one more time. How does one escape from the work farm? If you do escape, do you make out alive? I first saw Anitra Ford on the Price is Right Game Show as a model with those gorgeous long legs. As far as I'm concern Anitra does an excellent showing for herself. If you like Anitra Ford then you like this picture.	1

It runs well, keeps good time and the movement has a very good reputation for reliability.  If you're an extra large person and don't mind a heavy watch, you may be interested in this.  If you're average size or smaller, I wouldn't recommend it.  Personally, this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet-proof in normal use	1

I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system.  While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right.  While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system.  I have  only one complaint and that is  I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters.  My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages.  But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.	1

600397	I thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've baked from it so far.  I was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.	0
0767811097:really,_really,_really_bad:kimberley_wilson	First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.	0

And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.	1

Instructions worthless -- only learned by reading reviews here that it is possible to change some display settings then went to much trial and  error.  After getting best possible settings, main problem is still picture quality: using high quality jpg files as input, photos display with about the visual sharpness of the Sunday funnies -- individual dots very noticeable even at some distance.  Not at all like what I have seen in other digital picture frames.  Just arrived from Amazon and intended as a V-Day gift (tomorrow) for my wife, big disappointment, guess I better make a dash to the florist.	0

I just cooked brauts without a flare up! Price was great; thanks Amazon	1
6304429711:a_great_introduction_to_clint_eastwood_and_to_westerns:jessica_lux-baumann_"lagizma"	Not being a fan of Westerns, I figured I would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on.  The opening scene completely sucked me in, though, and the movie took off from there.  The movie opens with Eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend's cattle.  Eastwood is left to die, only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail, where his story is verified by the judge, and Eastwood gets a job as a marshal.  His intention, of course, is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice.  The action in the movie consists of Eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt, all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare.	1

B00030IN6U:well_worth_the_price:kt_710	I have been using this razor for about 6 years now, probably as long as they have been out. They may be pricey but well worth it. I used to use disposables and nicked/cut my legs almost every time. I switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little. It is so quick and easy to use, and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams. They do only last for 3-5 shaves, but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream, it's probably not that much more expensive	1

B000BWZGIS:coby_is_good_enough_for_me:d._thompson	I recently bought one of these babies for my niece seeing that she loves music but I was unwilling to pay an arm and a leg. It was a reasonable price and offers just what it delivers. She seems to really enjoy and found it to be easy to load both music and documents. The only real problem that I had with is that it costed less a few days after I purchased it. But that's really a personal problem	1
B000J1F9OM:not_so_sure_about_this_doll:jennifer_s._latimer_"jennlatimer2"	I bought this doll for my daughter for christmas and she was so excited, however in the last three days I have found that this doll was not worth the price.  The paint on the lips has already worn off, the eye lashes are falling out and it is difficult to keep the face clean, no matter how many times a day we wash it.  It has also stopped drinking when the bottle is placed into it's mouth.  I know of several other girls that are friends of my daughter who are having the same diffculties as we are.  If my daughter didn't love this doll some much I would return it for something worth it.  I guess if you are just intrested in making your child happy this is a good product however for the money I would suggest something else.	0

550400	Katie Holmes plays April, a young woman whose family has despaired of her.  She has invited them for Thanksgiving dinner, and it's particularly important because her mother (Patricia Clarkson) has cancer and is not expected to live. Katie is living in NYC with her boyfriend in the kind of grafitti-covered apartment building filled with an odd assortment of tenants that is only to be found in NY -- in other words, it will terrify her non-urban family.  The film begins as Katie wakes up -- she's never cooked a big dinner like this before and has a reputation for failure with her family.  In fact, her family puts her down so much that you quickly feel sorry for her -- no-one could be that bad, and isn't your family supposed to have an unnaturally high opinion of you, and not the other way around?	1
65317	When I first saw the previews, I thought that it looked very interesting and could be a good movie...of course, I thought the same about White Noise.  I guess the lesson here is that Hollywood has trouble making a good movie from beginning to end (like The Sixth Sense).  I think Hollywood is more interested in making a good TRAILER than they are a good movie so they can make a lot of money in the box office.  The Forgotten is no exception.  The first half an hour or so is very good and Joseph Ruben creates a creepy atmosphere with good performances from Julianne Moore and Dominic West.  However, the movie quickly begins to fall apart (like White Noise) and becomes less and less believable.  I was hoping for a logical explanation, especially since the box of the movie read: "The biggest jaw-dropper since The Sixth Sense."  However, the explanation is flimsy and unrealistic and my jaw only dropped at how ridiculous it was.  Nothing at all like when the ending came for Sixth Sense.  I bought this movie for $2 so I can't complain but so much, but am still amazed at Hollywood still struggles to make an entertaining, cohesive movie without so many holes.  The only thing that is "forgotten" is I have forgotten when creepy, psychological movies were good	0

B00000INCN:_teenage_wasteland!:billy_c_bowden_"jett"	There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum	1

B0002DP5AA:truly_the_best!!:c._ruffino	This is by far the best Shampoo and Conditioner set I have used.  I have very fine, very straight, and very long hair that breaks easily but not with this shampoo and conditioner.  This set makes it smooth, but not oily and so when I brush my hair there is no yanking going on.  My hair is noticeably more shiny and soft.  It has a very pleasant scent and it is all natural.  What a great way to pamper yourself!  Definitely worth the extra investment	1
B00005T3PP:good_packaging,_slick_design,_but_does_it_do_anything?:jacob_walker	I bought the Terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some AM and FM radio stations I was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system.  Perhpas because of my apartment building, or the quality of the stereo, the antenna didn't offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory-provided antenna.  I did notice improvement in the static (or lack of it) on stations that were already tuning in fairly well (they went from great to excellent), but the stations that were tuning in &quot;poorly&quot; got no better with the Terk antenna.  Overall, it was probably not worth the money paid	0

I have outside wiring so this is no trouble.

B00006498N:great_results,_if_you_can_get_the_dryer_to_stay_on:grj	This dryer made my wavy hair straighter than a seperate brush and dryer ever could.  THe problem is that it just shuts off.  The first time I used it, it shut off twice within a 20-minute period.  It wouldn't restart when I plugged it back in, or even when I tried a different outlet.  No matter what I tried, it wouldn't restart for about 5 minutes.  I've used an older model of this dryer and the same thing happened.  I wouldn't recommend buying this product	0

323119	This movie is a fast ride and a lot of fun.  It is the furthest thing from a slow-moving documentary.  The technical style and flair would appeal to practically any viewer.  The Source is glossy and gorgeous.  The director's clout is also impressive. Johnny Depp gives a performance monologue as Jack Kerouac and John Torturro gives an emotional reading from "Howl."  Dennis Hopper imitates Burroughs as well later in the film.  Their efforts are impressive.	1
B0002TFO3M:does_not_fit_in_a_motorola_v60:david_moore	I bought this because my current battery would die after 5 to 15 minutes of talk time on a full charge (after sitting in a closet for a year). I was thrilled to get a battery that would make my mobile phone truly mobile again. I opened it up, put it in my phone, tried to close the battery cover and it would not close. Not even close. If I forced it really hard I could get it to just close over the latch, but it was actually bending the plastic of the phone and the latch would probably be in danger of popping off at any moment.	0
284616	Bought two of the 98 inch k bodies on March 22, 2006, received on May 5, 2006, worried about them flexing at first with no problem. Anybody that has ever clamped with any Bessey k body, knows how heavy duty they are and the great price $50.00 bucks from Toolcrib made it a great deal, plus a free 24 inch k body. The clamps are now shipping from Amazon warehouses, instead of Toolcrib's, so don't expect to have them in good shape the first time. When I first ordered them, I received two 82 inch k bodies instead, wrapped pretty good in four sheets of cardboard. Second time shipped, I received two 98 inch k bodies well damaged, one in a 12 x 12 inch bubble wrap bag covering one end torn open, damaged on the red end, missing the black plastic end piece and the other packaged what looks like a cereal box, crushed red end and also missing the black plastic end. Third time ordered, I was told I would be placed on the top of the order list, when the inventory for the Bessey 98 k bodies came in, not. Last ones received were ok, still had to use some parts from the other ones to make two good ones before they were picked up. By the way, the free 24 inch Bessey k body clamp was wrapped very well and was received on March 28, 2006 in excellent shape. When Amazon mentioned free shipping, they forgot to mention the bad packaging job before shipping.	1

257103	Computer games have a bad reputation:  They're violent, mindless, escapist, blah, blah, blah.  Mostly, that reputation is well-deserved; computer games are entertainment, and, as such, they're designed to take our minds off of the "real" world for a while.  What's wrong with that?	1
B000FKKO74:user_friendly:jonig_"a_pet_owner"	I must admit I read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive, however... .  I found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items I've tried so far. I initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time (before reading the instructions) . This made things more difficult so I started over, set it for everything to be automatic, including the time, left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its' thing - which it did magnificently. EVERYTHING worked beautifully and it did a great job. I LOVE the one-touch recording. I found it's best to read directions one at a time as I want to try something new and have had no problems. So far I haven't tried everything it will do but find it's very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use. It's a joy to hit the TVGuide button, highlight the shows I want to watch and hit the record button. So far I have no complaints	1
B0007D3B56:a_fun_fragrance!:beth_cholette_"doctor_beth"	This fun fragrance comes across to me as soft and slightly sweet, with a feel that's both young and a bit sexy.  The scent is quite pretty, with a bit of floral, and the lightness of it makes it a perfect everyday scent (although it works well for romance, too!).  As mentioned above, the scent does have a youthful, fresh feel to it, and although I've heard some say that the fragrance is best for teens, I'm almost 40, and I enjoy it on days that I'm looking for something lighthearted and fun (granted, I probably wouldn't wear it everyday).  Lucky You comes in a cute pink bottle with a unique rubber stopper, and it has good staying power, although the scent grows more subtle over time.  Recommended for women of all ages who are young at heart	1
B00000J0SF:clogged_jets_recurrent_problem:joel_buckley	I've had a 660 printer a couple of years and gone through 6 color  cartridges. Four of them had a couple of the jets clog after 1 or two  weeks. Running the head cleaner just wastes ink (a lot) without opening the  clogged jets. Then you have the choice of throwing away a $30 cartridge  you've hardly used or printing with gaps. I will not buy another HP  printer. I've wasted more on cartridges then the printer cost	0

B000MGUZJ8:different_kind_of_stoner_flick:andrea_stuut	I stumbled across this movie on cable a couple of years ago, having nothing better to do I watched it. My first impression was that it would be just another stoner movie were nothing really happens. I was suprised though because not only does it have a plot it has a interesting plot. You don't have to be stoned, or even a stoner to enjoy this movie. One reveiwer said somthing along the lines of it looking like grade school kids made it. Well it is true it was an independent film made on the cheep but think it actualy adds something to the over all feel of the film, like your actualy there, scrapping through life with the characters. I guess I can understand why some people wouldnt get this movie, not enough bells and whisels, but if your up for something differnt give it a try. by the way, the movie was based on a book of the same name, also very good and differnt	1
B0009FUAQ0:poorly_made:drmike	I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....	0

388950	I haven't tried it with the light gun yet, but even with 2 dual-shocks this is a unique and accessible 2-player co-op game (one drives, one shoots) with decent replay value.  I don't think the difficulty can be increased, but it's fun to go back and beat your old scores and play with the unlocked cars.  i suppose it could be finished in a rental, but personally I find it's nice to own some simple co-op games like this that you can pop in and play right away if a friend shows up, esp. if that friend is not a hardcore gamer.  as a 1-Player game it starts to feel like GTA-lite after awhile, although for kids this one is better because it lacks the mature content	1

183579	Review no.77.A superbly/nicely done reissue of The Zombie's second 'actual' album(isn't it?).Total of 27 tracks,so since the first twelve(12)cuts were the original lp,I guess that means you get seventeen bonus tracks,wow!That's a lot,for a one-disc release.A fine CD to repeatedly play,plus keep in your 'current rotation' stack for a long time to come.It's PROBABLY just me,but these tunes SHOULD be in a different playing order.That's why I'll sometimes pre-program this CD before I listen to it.Loads of fabulous/memorable tunes to enlighten your evening with here,like "Care Of Cell 44"(three versions,but welcome),"Time Of The Season"(stereo and mono versions),the beautifully-done melodic "A Rose For Emily"(2 versions),"I Want Her,She Wants Me","Maybe After He's Gone" and a cut that I've certainly never heard before,but was quite impressed with it,"Butchers Tale".Obviously,The Zombies must've had hours of unreleased material that most of the world didn't take great notice of,until now.Simply,a must-have.Timeless top rate British Invasion rock&roll that'll never truly die	1
B0000509C3:cheeze-corn...:bindy_sue_frnknschtein_"bigfootsalienbaby"	I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...	0
B0000936B6:best_investment,_ever.:nocturnal_"nocturnal"	This has been the best investment I've made for quite some time.  After experiencing the black out after the earthquake that hit Hawaii last year and having my computer die, I invested into this unit.  I read a few reviews from various sites that said there was issues with it and that often times it came broken.  I thought to myself the good reviews outweigh the bad so I'm going to try it and see.  Sure enough this unit came with no problems.  I plugged it in and let it charge over night.  I then added my computer and my monitor to it.  I've seen it kick in while the lights dimmed at my home and I'm so thankful that it has saved my computer.  If anything everyone should invest in one of these for their computers.  I fix computers for a living and more often than not people bring in their dead computers due to a power outage or power surge	1
B000BZZK90:dumb_software,_reliable_hardware:pure_logic	I've used the SD-YD250 hundreds of times over the last 2 years and it still shows no significant signs of wear. Overall, the product is a five star because of its reliability and labor-saving convenience. I've used it equally for baking bread and making pizza dough. It can also save a lot of money, provided you purchase the yeast in bulk (for example 2lb). The single use yeast packages which are typically the only buying option at American supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram. Particularly great savings are possible when using it to make pizza dough. This takes the tedious work out of making your own pizza, and when the dough is refrigerated for later use, it tastes even better in my opinion.	1
B0002OOMSA:pizza_on_the_grill:t._smith	This pizza cooker works really well.  I have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time.   A couple of hints for using the cooker ;turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm, slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan.	1

The rubbery material tends to collect all sorts of dust and lint.  It's very hard to get it off (unless you wash it with water or use tape to peel it off).  The protective cover doesn't fit around the screen too well.  Mine tends to be stretched out a little more on the left side than on the right (even if I try and reposition the unit itself).  The plastic screen cover (that can be removed) was already scratched due to the way it is packaged.  All in all, I am pretty disappointed... mainly because I paid over $33 for it.  It's now sitting on my desk at work collecting dust	0
393619	Shakespeare's life is frustratingly beyond our sight. Aside from the plays (which, in many cases, come down to us in different versions), we have a slim scattering of legal documents, marriage and birth records, and vague secondary accounts.	1
29498	I read the Nation for its poetry, Katha Pollitt and takes on the news.  It's a left wing magazine.  I don't understand the people who criticize it for being liberal and expect "objectivity". Humans have opinions and viewpoints. Even Time magazine and the National Review have viewpoints.	1
B000EGM3QO:too_many_workarounds_-_too_complex_for_the_average_user:eric_r.	I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.	0
B0000VBUP8:lx4:cheap_monitor_or_expensive_computer_speakers:brandon_nimon_"brandon"	I use my LX4 2.1 system as my desktop PC speakers. I got this recommendation from Maximum PC, since the LX4 5.1 system was 2005's best speaker system. You can view their gear of the year review here: http://www.maximumpc.com/2005/12/m-audio_studiop_1.html. Being skeptical of a $550 5.1 system with only 27 watts to each satellite, I wanted to start slow and only ordered the 2.1 system. As soon as I purchased cables (FYI: no 1/8" stereo to two 1/4" mono cables seem to exists -as far as I've seen--, so you have to use adaptors) I was blown away by the crisp flowing sounds of the speakers. I wasn't used to speakers with crossovers, where only the each type of speaker (tweeter, woofer, and sub) gets the right frequencies, so no overlapping exists. All the sounds are crystal clear and the housings is very dense and resilient, while the speakers themselves are of superb build quality. After only a few hours of listening to many kinds of music and playing sound-intensive games, I immediately hopped back online and ordered myself the 5.1 expander setup.	1
B0001YXWTG:broke_without_warning:jared_orth	I bought this Adapter because I could use the cable that came with iPOD, (one fewer thing to carry).  Well, about six months after opening this item, I noticed that my iPOD was running on battery.  One of the contacts had broken, and the device was not working anymore.  I am disappointed, but should have expected that for the $10 I spent.	0
B00005UKXM:a_standard_case_that_doesn't_add_much:r._mozingo	This case is good for protecting your camera from nicks and scratches caused by storing it in purses, briefcases or luggage.  But don't count on it to protect your camera from falls, dirt or dust.	0
435461	I bought this game because i thought it would be fun to play along with the story like in the sims2 for ds. The beginning went well, the operations are fun. The story drags a little and goes too slow, i actually skipped part of the story and just did the operations. The operations get your heart pumping and are somewhat stressful. i am stuck on the 6th one. i have been trying to complete it for a few weeks now, but continuously fail. Unfortunetly you cannot go any further until you complete them in order. i dont know if i will be able to play this game any further	1
B00006FXOO:amazing_magazine_-_well_worth_the_money:jennifer	Although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old, my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine. She has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation. Not only are the stories lively and entertaining, they are educational as well (I am also learning various things about history and culture that I did not know before!). There is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry. Since receiving this magazine, I have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills. These reasons are why I believe it is well worth the money and I wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time.	1

B000G7WX3Y:very_cute,_practical:elisa_"elymom76"	The pacified pod isn's "essential", but it's definitely good to have. You can keep the pacifier clean and easier to find in the diaper bag or in mom's bag, or you can simply hook this on the stroller if you are just going for a walk. And with all the cute patterns, you can definitely find one that suits your taste and matches your stroller or diaper bag	1
B0001F0XHE:slow_bloatware:vermonter	I made the mistake of buying a two-year subscription.  Every upgrade slows the product down.  A scan that used to take 14 minutes now takes over one hour. Stay away from this junk--there are much better free products available	0
B0002JN26S:works_great!:d._durose	I love Rain-X.  The rain literally beads up and rolls right off your windshield.  It keeps my windshield nice and clean.  It's almost like you don't even have to put on your wipers when you're driving and there's a light rain	1
B0009VC9U4:good_knife;_could_have_been_a_little_better:enricomaynardo	I like this knife very much; it's size, shape, fit in the hand, and pocket clip are all just what I wanted. It has a nice edge and the Speed Safe assisted opening feature is fantastic. My only complaint is that the safety is placed in such a way that makes one-handed opening difficult with the safety engaged. I want the safety engaged because the assisted opening is so easy to activate and I don't want the knife springing open in my pocket. This is only a minor quibble, though. I do enjoy the knife very much; it is a good size to wear with jeans for light duty day-to-day use, which is what most people need a pocket knife for anyway. I use a different, larger knife for heavier duty use	1
B0002D4QBE:duro-med_shower_tub_stool:robert_william_jones	Unfortunately, the stool arrived in its box without the seat. As we needed one quickly, we purchased a similar stool locally. We returned the stool and Amazon was quick to give us a refund. The manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control	0
B0000CAQ0R:we_now_have_hot_stuff_in_2_places!!:judy_a._dorsman_"beachinit"	We had bought one of these for this house, loved it so much we bought one for the other house, too.  The original one was bought w/ the 22" wok, which is gorgeous.  We use both w/ woks and it's kewl.  Easy to break down for travel, too.  Only thing was I shoulda bought the cover for the 22" wok while they were available.  Can't seem to get one now.	1

6304006837:dreadful:"k9danny"	I recall this movie fondly--Unfortunately, the DVD quality is so poor, this cannot be watched.  Pity Amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings.  Don't waste your time until someone cleans this up.  But it makes a nice coaster, though	0

B000JEJAAI:great_bracelet:pamela_j._tkaczuk_"pammyt"	I love this bracelet.  It's very pretty & looks just like it was shown.  Looks expensive & tasteful.  I have bigger wrists, so I'd like it better if it came in larger sizes..but it goes great with my watch	1
B0006H4C0G:expected_better:p._wilon	For the price, I expected a quality canister.  The plastic insert in the lid arrived unglued, and hardly creates an airtight seal.  Had I seen this item in a store I would have passed on it immediately.	0
B000F1SMV8:clubs_broke:rene_harvey	After only one or two uses, the heads of the clubs began breaking off from the shafts, rending themselves completely useless.

B000FBM296:defective_item_and_poor_customer_service:b._landau	This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof. We tried it on two separate occasions, both times fully closing each seal, but water leaked through anyway, soaking the contents. When I tried to return the item, the seller refused to accept it, claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly. Despite what the company now says, the fact is that the item was defective. I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem, and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company	0
B000085OY0:river_phoenix_in_his_prime.:gregory_alongi	This movie is very simple, and unique. It's the kind of love story which you really believe in while you're watching because it doesn't feel phony. This can be credited to the acting, the situation, and the plot as well. This isn't about a man falling madly in love with a beautiful woman and then spending his life missing her. That's all been done, and that's what makes this film a breath of fresh air. River Phoenix shows why he is missed by so many, and really allows you to connect with his character. I recomend this to anyone who wants to see love put to true art, and be touched at the same time	1
0691121141:andre_kertesz:sulema_ebrahim_"advent_reader"	This is a superb collection and a true tribute to this incredible photographer	1
B0007PRAUQ:very_effective_and_a_bargain:marco_zunino	I made the mistake to buy the Kensington laser pointer before this one. The Kensington is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. I to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the Kensington, together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. My kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the Hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it.	1
B00005YXVJ:great_toy_for_the_barney_fan...:	My son got this toy for his birthday about a year ago, when he was two. It was one of the gifts we let him pick out on his own. He loved it and played with nothing else for a week! The songs are cute and familiar to him, plus Barney talks and sings to the music. The only draw backs were that I couldn't find an off button and that it is $20+ at local retailers. I wish the toys companies would cut us parents a little slack. LOL	1
604775	While this lens has an attractive price tag, this lens has serious trouble with sharpness. Only at high shutter speeds (1/250 and above approx.) or with a good flash and middle apertures (f/8 to f/22 approx.) does it deliver sharp images. Horribly slow autofocus. I am already saving to buy and L-series or the IS USM version	0

B000CC09UW:great_demographic_program:dfc	I was very pleased to discover all of the data packed into this program.  Setting up the query parameters is easy & the amount of info concerning places of interest (services, banks, transportation) is substantial.  About the only drawback I found was the quality of the help contents, which was not very user friendly.  Most of the time I was unable to find solutions to my question/problem because the data was way too complicated (displaying data in technical equations) or was not listed at all.  However, calls to technical support usually resolved the questions.  Finally, I was disappointed that the program does not allow you to print written legends off to the side on your map (ie: a listing of addresses for your push pin locations).  Other than that, the program is very handy, loaded with tons of great data & the quality of the maps is superior.	1
B000FZ1WTI:i_got_this_for_the_compass_only._:jigglypuff_of_doom_"jigglypuff_of_doom"	i cant say anything for the other things, but the compass does not work at all.

B000A7S596:porn_star_barbie:kim	Just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here, but I still feel that I have to put my two cents in.  My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday.  This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it.  Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that.  The doll looks like a [...].  The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context.  Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't.  But do you want your sweet little girl looking at this and imagining how pretty she will look one day in a crotch-length skirt?	0
B000H1XY3M:family_tree_maker:anita_a._southard	I can never understand why others would want to use anything else, I have tried four others and this one has been the best of all. I now have been using this product starting about 1989, I upgrade about every 3 to four year	1
B0006ZWPPC:locket_is_very_small:a._fairchild_"mom_of_2_girls"	We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn	0
B0002PAVE8:adorable_toy:mrs._piggy	I think this toy is just too cute.  It is a bit pricey though.  I would not suggest you purchase this toy for a young toddler...maybe a 2 1/2 to 3 year old.  My daughter likes throwing it on the ground and screaming with delight (she is one and a half).  She really likes it and carries it around the house.  She is a little too young to respect it properly and I fear it may not last long.  It is really cute if you have real stainless steal appliances in your home.  I bought this because my daughter has taken a keen interest in my microwave and I have trouble keeping her away from it.  This toy has solved that problem.  One minus is that it came with no instructions on how to get the table to rotate.  You have to play with the buttons a little and then you will see how it operates.  My daughter can not systematically make the turn table rotate...for her it happens randomly.  She enjoys opening the doors, pushing the buttons, seeing the light come on and hiding her real dinner in there (so parents beware!).  Someone suggested it is a tiny unit...and so it is, but all the other toy microwaves I looked at were very similar in size	1
B000IAUJXU:great_episode:alena_kinser_"leeners"	This is the first episode where we really see the heart of Tony in his dealings with a teenager struggling with the horrible death of his father. A must see	1
B000JNDWTO:decent_fabric,_horrible_band,_couldn't_notice_the_fit.:w._j._regotti	The fabric is a little stiff at first, bust softens to a acceptable level after a few washes. The elastic band around the waist of these boxers contracts to the point where it wrinkles up the fabric. After a few hours of wear you have the indents of the crinkled up band on your skin and it feels quite uncomfortable. While cheap and nicely packaged, these things suck. Spend some money on decent underwear	0
B00022VZ1E:perfect_protection_for_an_excellent_camera:d._buxman_"a_seeker_of_truth"	I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value	1
B000EZVW44:size_and_fit:jeff_ray	The picture and dimensions are incorrect.  It is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue.  The correct dimensions are 2.9"x4.2"x1.8" (WxHxD).	1
B0007X9F7E:not_too_bad:kirill_yunussov	I really liked this watch before i bought it, and then I liked it some more for another 2-3 weeks.   but after that it started to seem plain to me.  i want something more fanc	1

B000FBQWEM:i_love_this_cereal:pati_taylor	I love this cereal.  I like the slightly sweet wheaty taste, and the fact that it holds its crunch in milk for a long time.  I also snack on it dry.  It stays with me for a long time, keeping me from eating junk	1
076780421X:love_love_this_movie:pebblepuppy	I've seen it about 20 times now.  It doesn't get old.  The faces, the moves and the lines of Matthew Perry are always fresh.  My husband likes Selma, a lot, so it's a win win for both of us.  They are great together.	1

491531	This book is a gem that is filled with ideas from many of THE BEST speakers in the world. What a great resource! It is my favorite book now for ideas on how to be more &quot;impactful&quot; in my message to the audience.  This reminds me of one of my other classic favorites, Think and Grow Rich.  I'm ordering another copy for a friend today	1
B0006OJ03S:dont_buy_it:paula_lee_"miserable66"	Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.	0
B000BLJ8CO:mobile_stops_turning:s._anderson	This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways.  I liked to idea, but just doesn't work.  This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round.  The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets "stuck" and we have to push it to get "unstuck".  We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store.  (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.	0
61833	At one time, Southern Living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas.  Over the past few years, it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food, in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook.  Only the Christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now.  We cannot speak to its information on gardening, just the cooking part.  If it were not my mother's habit of reading Southern Living, we would have cancelled this long ago.  If you are a serious cook, get the cookbooks from years ago.  The current magazine is well beneath you	0
B0006NGVPY:we_use_these_as_train_table_accessories...:pam	...and they are working out great with our Thomas Layouts.  Melissa & Doug products continue to impress me with their high quality and typically provide great educational value.  These are educational and your children will learn things like Police Station, Fire Station, Hospital, School, Town Hall, Grocery Store, and Post Office.  There are several different shapes too, including squares, rectangles, triangle, and the various signs.  The buildings and most of the roof pieces only have the building design on one side.  The trees, ambulance, fire truck, and mail truck are large and double sided.  The various street signs, and passenger cars are a little small, and as the box states ages 3+ and up, I would consider these smaller pieces a choking hazard.  The larger pieces are enjoyed by both my 1 yr old and my 3 yr old.  The rectangles are the largest piece in the set and measure 4 3/4 by 2 1/4" approx.  Squares are roughly 2 1/4 x 2 1/4".  These blocks are not as heavy as I expected, but still nicely made, and bright colorful additions to playsets like Thomas/Brio train sets.  If your children don't insist on the real thing, this is a great way to save some money and still buy a quality product.	1
B0000029B0:if_there's_nothing_better....:the_lukewarm	This is definitely not a bad collection, but there are so many better ones out there, that this should not be your first choice. The song Sweet Emotion has been completely destroyed on this album. the entire bass intro has been cut out, and the song starts about an entire minute into it. There really is no reason to do this, as even on the radio, they play the entire thing, as it runs about 4 and a half minutes long. The song starts at a terrible place too. It sounds like it would if you turned on your radio to the middle of the song, then just stuck it on the cd that way. Again, not a terrible compilation, but definitely not a good first choice	0

227067	Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages	0
B000FGXQ7I:top_shelf_tuna:j._hewitt_"just_do_itt."	This is just what I've been needing for a power lifting diet, or optimal health in general. The flavor of the meat is not masked by salt.

B0007YYAM8:sharp_toaster_microwave_better_off_with_one_or_the_other:city_girl	We got this as a present and had high hopes to actually use it as a microwave. It takes over 7 minutes to warm something up and forget about making microwave popcorn it just doesn't pop the kernals. Overall lots of features but it's the worst microwave I've ever owned	0
332743	I've received The Whole Dog Journal for the past year.  I have found it to be refreshing as it has no advertisements.  It's pure holistic news, information, health, nutrition, training, food testing, and anything else pertaining to DOGS!  I would recommend this magazine to new dog owners as well as seasoned.  One thing about the world of dogs is that it is ever changing.  It's not always easy to get information that is up-to-date, helpful, and necessary.  With The Whole Dog Journal one can be certain that they will have the best knowledge	1
B000FSFNVI:outstanding_tool:kevin_s._kirby	This is, hands-down, the best hair removal tool on the market. It grabs an astounding amount of undercoat and topcoat hair.

B000HE4OJM:the_perfect_software_for_your_enemies.:a._green_"aleckzandr"	Caution: Giving this software to your enemies will gaurantee that they will become mortal enemies, if they are not so already. 1 star is overrating this "product". I am only writing this review to satify some sort of altruistic urge. This software isn't worth a second more of your time. Just click a link now. Good bye! You are still there? OK, read on. I write computer code (C++, Java, C#) for a living and I could not get this software to work correctly. Starting up the "main console" application (read: service) kept turning off the Firewall (service). I could turn on the Firewall - but only if the main service was off. Brilliant! Well done guys on this festering sore of a pile of software. Glad I got my $50 back with the rebates, they should have paid me at least $100 for the wasted time. I spent an hour with their help, chat (which was slow and ineffective) and another 30 minutes tweaking the registry, all to no avail, but lots of frustration. I'm looking for another Firewall/Virus solution now	0
B00004ZAW1:sugar_and_water_is_just_fine:william_m._taylor_"hummingbird_biologist"	This product to my knowledge is completely untested.

534118	Video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. Yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. That has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time, Gamepro. They truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers, and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. The magazine is quite well, but I honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, when most of it primarily focuses in on Playstation 2 & Xbox. Yet, Gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. Anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games, this magazine is worth reading.	1
B0000DZ3GQ:my_kids_love_this_video!:kim_austin_"walton_fan"	My little boy who is 8 years old loves this movie.  He goes around acting like the characters from the movie!  He really likes Harold and keeps watching the movie over and over again hoping for a different ending.  He is also convinced that they should make a Midnight Madness 2 and let Harold win the next time!  This is a great movie, with a young Michael J. Fox in it, and has no sex or violence and is a very kid friendly movie	1

0195188233:interesting_and_intelligent_discussion_on_islam_in_turkey:	A well-crafted comprehensive look at the role of Islam in Turkey. The book offers some original and compelling explanations regarding the social transformation that Turkey has experienced since the 1980s. Specifically, the author mentions the role of opportunity spaces in the evolution of Islamic movements and ideas as a result of economic and political liberalization.I think anyone who is interested in Turkey, Islamic movements, and the relationship between Islam and modernity would get a great deal out of this book	1

B000CR0088:tasty_but_burnt_and_salty:paul_d._pruitt_"socrtwo"	OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon	0

B000DN7M7I:still_the_best:v._perkins	I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.	1

300680	We just got it, I first gave it a 60 second shake and it worked fine, and I let it sit for a day and a half.  It lit up again without shaking so the capacitor holds the energy a very long time. Shaking it for over a minute continuosly gave me a bright shine that lasts pretty long. We are in the Caribbean with literally no electricity most of the time without even moonlight. This works perfectly.	1
B00006I57A:wouldn't_use_anything_else.:kristine_gregorowicz	I bought a cross pen, and when I ran out of refills, I went to a local store that sold cross. They told me that I could use another brand of ink and everything would be just fine. Well, it wasn't. It was of the wrong consistency and my pen ran and ran. So, I finally found these and my pen is right as rain now	1
485225	Season one of Nelwlyweds is hilarious....you will enjoy watching Nick & Jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage!

509246	I bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection, or using a USB flash drive.  I have not been able to get either to work correctly.  After following their instructions on the Datel website on how to update the codes using a USB drive, it deleted my game saves on the memory card.  It also corrupted the memory card, and corrupted saves on the card in slot 2.  I have had nothing but trouble with it, it's slow and doesn't live up to the promises.  Their customer support is lousy, with a response that merely said...sorry.  Well thanks a lot to them...just lost hours of game saves!!	0
B000LSGSPW:time_&_money_well_spent!:jennmail	This workout is short but you will feel "worked out" when done.  Tina cues well and the workout flows very smoothly.  No awkward transitions.  The ball is used for both total body toning and 4 limb cardio.  Your core and abs get a great workout too with both traditional and functional moves.  I enjoyed the change of using the ball instead of dumbells.  Definitely "shocked" the muscles	1
B000EN43D8:a_very_good_movie_and_game_player:e._linton	My [...] girl and [...] boy both love their players. The [...]really likes the Sonic games and the ability to connect it to the TV.

The builtin screens are a little low in resolution if you look closely but cartoons look good and the kids have not noticed anything.	1

234975	As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap.	0
B00004C8SV:what_a_waste!!!:melinda	I don't usually bother complaining about products, but this thermometer was such a waste of $, I just wanted to save someone else the trouble. The temperature readings on this are SOOO inaccurate. EVERY time that we check a temp. it is different, it varies alot. Just to see if it worked we tried 8 times in a row on ourselves to see what we got. Every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees. It reads low sometimes, so you may have a temperature and not be aware. And we couldn't even take it back to the store. Do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer.We didn't have any luck with a diffferent brand either, the ear ones are all off, but not as bad as this one	0
3958	Great magazine couldn't recommend it any higher for anyone starting out with macs. iCreate also introduced a great Pro section in 2005 to delveinto the workings of ProApps such as Final Cut Pro, Photoshop, mDVD Studio Pro etc. Now here's the thing, I'm wondering how the magazine can be available for subscription while the magazine was put on hold late last year. Me, or anyone I know with a subscription haven't recieved the mag for months, and there has been no contact from the people who handle the  subscription despite zillions of e-mails. So be careful, get the full story before you hand over any money!!!!!!!!!!!  check the web for similar storries, you will find the	1
B0006N3KQW:quality's_gone_down_the_tubes:captain_jack	I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore	0
B0001D12XA:terrible_to_assemble:maryland_mom	After my husband and I put this together using the TERRIBLE directions, we've been using this as a free-standing bassinet for the past 5 months (not attached to the bed, as some people do).  My daughter has been sleeping in it just fine.  However, we attempted to fold it up to take it with us on a weekend away from home recently.  What a nightmare to collapse!  Again, the directions are of absolutely no help.  It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up.  Also, this thing weighs a ton.  I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling.  How annoying.  Bottom line:  if you're going to set this up and never take it down, it's fine (once you initially get it put together, that is).  However,  if you think you'd like to use this on an occasional overnight trip away from home,  forget it!	0
B00007LI9D:solid_lens_from_canon:camel_driver	The optical x6 zoom on the Canon A710 IS is already better than cameras in it s range (i.e. non SLR). However, the zoom takes the picture up to the natural size; the tele converter lens really does make a difference.	1
B0009MAOBO:more_like_boring-broly:	I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting.	0

B00022WC1Q:worst_clippers_i've_ever_owned:d._nolan	I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck	0
475614	Laptop Magazine focuses on laptops, PDAs, and wireless computing.  Laptop Magazine seems like it's trying to be both technical and exciting; however it lacks the objectivity of PC Magazine and the deep enthusiasm of Wired.  Thus, it reads like a series of infomercials where each &quot;article&quot; paints a rose-colored view of each technology and the vendors products followed by paid ads of the same vendors portrayed so happily in the text.  Their conclusions all seem predetermined: new technology is better	0
B0007XBKQS:shakespeare_on_film_doesn't_get_much_better:scott_schiefelbein	I always have a soft spot in my heart for film adaptations of Shakespeare.  They are always labors of love, often cribbed together by excellent actors and technicians working well-below scale just for the sheer thrill of working with the Bard.  Even the less-successful productions, such as Mel Gibson's turn as the Prince of Denmark or the recent update of "Love's Labours Lost" win my affection if not my undying devotion.	1
17069	Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times	1
204180	First off, this book is very entertaining to read. Unlike many political books, it is never tedious or redundant. "Thieves in High Places" is an accurate portrayal of what is wrong with both parties in America. It is also informative and insightful on the roles of big Corporations in American politics and local economies.	1

B0002LZU7K:excellent_tool!:adam_m._collins	This multimeter is an all around good tool. It has all the features you need plus some of the features that only the more expensive ones have. Like the battery tester and backlight display. I am studying electronics right now and I find myself getting a ton more use out of it than I thought I would. It is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along. There are comperable multi-meters out there that cost less but most would cost more. There are certainly better multi-meters than this one but they will cost more. The only bad things I can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to. You have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart. Actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it. Also most multi-meters come with some sort of rubber, protective sleeve, that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it. If this mult-meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out, I would have given it a 5 Stars.	1
B000F2GI3Q:a_waste_of_cash:bertha_velasquez_"joe123"	I received the exercise bike, put it together as soon as I got it,  and started using it.

I contacted the guys who sold this to me to get my money back but they never got back to me.	0
B000F8FC9G:a_top_notch_product:robert_m._speeter_"speet"	Everything about the Sonos worked as advertised.  It was a snap to set up and it is slicker than I anticipated.  The interface is commonsense and well thought out.  It is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously.  You can also play different music, all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio.   It is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises	1

B0000E1WMJ:more_eurotrash_moaning:michael_j._bethancourt	If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.	0
B00008ZCDQ:not_very_good_at_all...:d._m.	The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the "microsope".	0

B000099Z3R:cute_house_perfect_for_3_year_old!:ally's_mom_"carly"	I bought this house for my daughter who will be 3 in 2 month's.  I did a lot of research and was torn between the twin town house and this one the Loving Family Sweet Sound's house. At first I almost went with the My first doll house by Fisher Price but was told by a friend she would proberly grow out of that fast and she was right.  This house the Sweet Sound's is a perfect size for her and I know she will get quite a few year's out of it.  Yes the Furniture is impossible to find.  After reading the review's I didn't look for it much knowing I would never find it.  I ended up buying her the Twin town's bathroom and a few pieces from the My first doll house by Fisher Price.  The pieces work perfect together and are chunkier for her and not so many tiny pieces.  They work great with the doll's that come with it too.  I did also purchase one doll set from twin town house.  The house does make some sound's with just the pieces that come with it, they are cute and my daughter doesn't know any better that it would make more if we could of found the correct sweet sounds furniture.  She's Happy with the way it is. I decided against the Twin Town because I agreed with some reviewers after looking at it that the room's were too tiny.  Yes you get more room's but my daughter I know would get so frusterated with alway's knocking the furniture over in those tiny room's.  This house has big room's.  It fold's up easy in half but not so good when it is filled with furniture.  We leave it open anyway's so that is not a big deal.  It was easy put together but the sticker's took about and hour to put on.  Also a note make sure and put the battery in BEFORE you fill it with furniture, I put the battery in last and ended up spilling the furniture everywhere.	1

B00029KWMA:unhappy_:k._johnsen_"celtickj"	I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more.

B0009HLCLK:very_technical,_but_still_very_interesting:c._kelley	This DVD is a great complement to the DVD's offered by VCE(Trinity and Beyond, Nukes in Space, etc). By itself, it is a highly technical look at the process of testing materials, military equipment, and building materials during three atomic test series covered on the DVD set. The quality of the film varies between the three discs. The last Civil Defense video on Disc 2 suffers a lot of audio warble, unfortunately. But, it is nice to see these important historical documents preserved in a digital format.	1
B0000UX4V2:one_of_the_bonus_features_is_worth_the_price_alone:david_reese	My first viewing of this film was a great disappointment.  I expected another Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy film, with Chevalier substituting for Eddy.  And I emphatically did not like the film.  Then I viewed the film a second time, this time with the play-by-play voice-over analysis by Miles Kreuger, which comes as a extra bonus on this DVD.  Suddenly I was seeing the film in a completely different light, and absolutely loving this film.  This DVD is an absolute gem, and one of the best things about it is the intelligent and articulate insights provided by Miles Kreuger, not confined to this film alone but applying to the cinema world at large in the early 30s.  It is as if a film critic from the 1930s had come back to life, as if he had actually been on the sets during the filming (because he's talked to those who were).  Kreuger's commentary alone is worth the price of this DVD.  After seeing this film for the first time, you must go back and see it again through Miles Kreuger's eyes.	1
31750	Long time MSL subscriber.  I get out my dec, dec/jan issues every holiday season to see what works for ornaments and decorations and such.  I loved the cookie issue last year, definite keeper.  Her projects involve time and materials, but you end up with something that will last, and instructions are generally very clear.  I've seen that since her trial/jail, the high end advertisors have almost entirely backed out, which means adds for average joes, like me.  I really appreciate the depth that the mag goes into a certain subject, even if its not a particular fave of mine.	1

And it's cute too.  I was shopping at Babys 'R' Us recently and the sales girl asked where I got my "super cute" diaper bag/carrier.  I told her and she insisted to her manager that the store start carrying the item (no word yet on whether or not they will).  I have recommended this bag to all my friends and bought two as shower gifts.  It's the ultimate in convenience and fashion	1

B0002L9JCC:fun_for_everyone:e._k._barrow	My friends and I, all in college, are major movie buffs, so when another friend told me about the game, I was eager to try it.  Some parts are tough, but with the team setup of the game, it seems to even out.  Favourite rounds were Still Crazy: a round where scenes are built piece by piece, a word association round: 6 clues are provided and the idea is to name the movie, and the quotes round, of course!  The hardest rounds were the matching and the trivia rounds.  Still, we had great fun.  Its better if the teams are evenly matched, then its more fun.  The main objection I have is that in the 8 rounds, many of the movies are dated and overused.  There are great ones, though...Rain Man, Cast Away!!  Also, this game is linear in progression, there is no variation in the order of the questions.  Scoring uses the honour system.  There are 3 games, each lasting around 45 minutes at the very fastest, its the same as the cost of a regular DVD and is much more fun with lots of people.  I have bought this for several people and some of my friends have as well.  Recently I played a game where a 12 year old and an 82 year old were playing so don't worry about the age thing, both enjoyed it.  Really, I recommend it	1
B000HCXKJY:2007_office_rocks!!!!!:stephen_"microsoft_2007_user"	Wow! I must say that the new office 2007 is way better than the 2003. It did take some time to get the hang of it because Microsoft changed around the icons and buttons. However, I do like it because now in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint 2007 you can creat charts and you can also preview how backgrounds look before appling to the slide. In the end, I think the 2007 is much more user-friendly than 2003. I recomend to anyone to buy this product if they wish to upgrade to the NEW 2007 Microsoft Office	1

B000FJSA2G:waited_30_years_for_this_product:migolfer	When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages	1
B000BVP1XO:a_very_uncomfortable_car_seat_cushion:linda	This car seat cushion's foam padding is not only paper thin, but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts (I'm not kidding) placed in some of the cushion's "massaging bubbles".  This makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat, as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine!  I threw my "Massage Cushion" into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing	0
B000B8FCEU:i_expected_more...:c._j._wright	When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.	0
B0007WBRY4:disappointed:j._pennetto	This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures.  I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality	0

B00006IIOY:don't_buy_this_one:	I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product	0
B000003BVG:the_vocal_album.:michael_stack	After two albums of wholly instrumental music, Joe Satriani apparently decided it was time to start singing.  "Flying in a Blue Dream" is the only Satriani record with several (six) vocal cuts.	0

B00068O74G:not_as_good_as_the_others:beach_bunny_beauty	I love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel, but this lotion is not getting as much love from me. It doesn't smell the same to me, and on a bad day, makes me a little sick.  It's sweeter smelling.  Thing is, I need lotion, and I don't want competing scents.  Otherwise, I might have rated it even lower	0
B000K8XSBU:good_but_not_perfect:purple_echo_"purple_echo"	I like the style, weight and size of this set, but I'm not sure how it is going to hold up in the dishwasher.

417758	He was at his best when he sang about the loneliness, perseverance and dreams of ordinary people.  In "Sandra" for instance it felt like he was singing about a neighbour.  The combination of his warm voice with his piano could be very moving and was definitely unique.  In the late eighties he started focusing on merely performing and doing cover versions.  He released a few inspired tracks now and then, his first Christmas album had a lot of charisma and warmth, and "Here at the Mayflower" was a sincere effort. He is an intelligent person who cares for music and doesn't let his superstardom go to his head.	0
B000MV9026:my_family_&_i_love_this_movie!!!:christina_lopez-strother_"slgamma2"	I read over some of the other people's opinions regarding this movie and cannot agree with them about it.  My kids ages 6 & 2 loved this movie from start to finish.  The music, the characters, and the story were great for the entire family.  I definitely recommend this movie for your family's movie collection	1
B000AR0LLG:it_is_a_downgraded_upgrade:b._d_falk_"eoi"	I was a real fan of omnipage until this version. The scanning speed is slug like. The proof reading function has is less functional the version 14, and it tends to forget the scanner settings.	0

B000FIJQI4:great_watch!:s._gatto_"happy_mom"	I love the look but was a little unhappy with the quality of the small melee diamonds used around the dial of the watch.  They are very milky and personally, I think the watch would look better without them at all if that's the only quality they had.	1

From the raunchy (&quot;Bitter Rain&quot;) to the uplifting (&quot;Good Day For The Blues&quot;) to the bittersweet (&quot;Cynical&quot;) to the soft (&quot;Share That Smile&quot;) Storyville encompasses the entire range of musical expression with a style that is as provocative as it is unique.

B00005KBVF:fun_little_gator:s._wou	It seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride-on toy. There are few "Barbie" Jeeps, few polaris ATVs, one Corvette and three Gators and few others. My 4 year old daughter was the first Gator owner.	1

206362	2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.	1
B0006TU9YW:art_set:crystal_ryan	It is all you could dream of in a art set.  Very organized and neat, I love being able to just get right to work.  I highly recomment this product for a level artist; it is a great bargain	1
B00006KFYB:save_your_time:k._keener_"redkeli"	I agree with the others in that this magazine is too content-filled with the most irrelevant content! The copy is way heavy, but few true words of wisdom. It showcases VERY little work by other graphic designers so if you're looking to peruse the latest talent, definitely stick with CA or HOW	0
B00009OL68:waterpik_wp-65__review:albert_j._magdaleno	design seems flawed a bit for the container. when you pull the cord out, it bumps the tank off sometimes.  the tank also seems a little loose when mounted.	0

534784	We've only used the mic (and another that is identical) about 10 times now, but no complaints so far.  My experience with Logitech products has been good in the past and I expect no different this time.  We use it for the Karaoke Revolution games for the PS2.	1
B0000CAQAE:great_bowls:hsmath	These bowls have been in my home for a few years now.  We have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave.  They are nice looking and very functional.  When we needed another bowl when one broke, we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl	1
B00070Q2VE:i_love_this_magazine:j._rose_"crazy_knitter"	What a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable. I really feel this mag. rides the line between fashionable and practical. I have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue. The directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds, but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store won't fix. There are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you wouldn't think was interesting, but then you start reading it and can't put it down.	1
B0000DZFXZ:amazing_mat.:s._brodeur-campbell	I've been doing yoga for 7 years.  I've gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now (I don't like how they get stretchy after a couple of years), so I decided to buy something more durable.  I love the texture of this mat -- it's very solid feeling with a good bit of stick -- and it doesn't move around at all.  It has just the right amount of cushion to it, and I use it on a hard floor.  I also bought the Lumi towel (large size), also by Manduka, to put on the mat, since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time I get to the middle of my routine, and this can make any mat slippery.  I didn't have any trouble with the coating on the mat -- it wore off after a little bit, and I used the towel until it did.  I also didn't agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy.  It's a bit heavy, but not too much to carry around all over -- I made a carry handle from a yoga strap (looped over both ends of the rolled up mat) and throw it over my shoulder	1
B00077AA5G:comfort_meter:grandma_f.	This comfort meter works very good.  The shipment came in time for a gift for Christmas.  One for us, one for gift.	1
198709	I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. "Breakin' Away", "Jarreau" and "Heaven and Earth" come to mind. Well, add "Givin' It Up" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a "Look the Rainbow" feel to it, there's a "Breakin' Away" feel to it, there's a "Jarreau" feel to it. There's even a "Glow" feel to it (when you think about tunes like "Milwaukee" and "Have You Seen the Child?"). Grassroots Al.	1
B0002ZHX58:worth_the_effort!!!:andi_passaro_"jesus_is_the_way!"	Don't listen to the whinnier. If you are serious about improving your focus and memory skills, this helps. You must use this program for 15 minutes everyday or you will be wasting your time and money. It is worth the effort! I noticed immediate results of being able to retain more info and having more focus at work. I also purchased the music CD's produced by the same company. They are helpful as well. I use them at work, at home, and in the car. The Brain Builder Booklet mentions the CD's. If you want to stop looking stupid because you can't remember information or you're tired of getting lost while driving, this will help you	1
B000GKXY7U:great_number_board:mommyguru_"mommyguru"	Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him.  He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him.  It's well built.  Arrived in only a couple days.  Our son loves it!	1
B0007XPS98:my_favorite_tea:cathy_"of_the_band,_cathy_and_the_wuthering_heights"	Of all teas I've tried, this is my favorite; sweet, powerful, and fragrant, MarketSpice is the answer for many moods and cravings.  I prefer this tea hot, steeped for 5+ minutes, but its good cold as well-although I've found adding any sweeteners to this tea can make it too overwhelming.  Be warned: if you only like very subtle white teas, this may not be for you . . . but it has converted many a non-tea-drinker friend of mine into looseleaf addicts	1
B000NGRH9S:nice_product!:amy_s._coddington_"amy_danger"	I wondered if the "snap on" concept would feel and look secure.  It DOES.  It's rock solid and looks like it's part of the phone.  Additionally, the extra protection it provides to the little screen is wonderful.  I'd love to buy more colors when/if they become available	1
B000BDGA5A:makes_a_great_lemon_drop:cocky_balboa	Nice clean Meyer lemon flavor. These lemons are just a tad bitter and have more sweetness than any other lemon. Chefs LOVE using these lemons in recipes. This flavor also makes a great lemon drop	1
B000KN7DDE:great_protection_and_a_great_price:lester_ross	I am still under the free 3 month trial period and love it.  I will buy it because it doesn't eat my memory and I feel safe with the people who designed the operating system.	1
B0007WX1J8:it's_beautiful_put_together!!_but....:crazytwins_"crazytwins"	Bought this for daughter for Christmas, and when I opened the box and saw the cardboard backing, debated on returning it. But they love the Pegasus Barbies, so figured okay, let's try it out! Is really beautiful when all put together, and my daughter LOVES it! But, that stupid cardboard backing. Nope, no way does it stay on at all. Am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset, and it will be fine. Right now is just standing up behind the set. Really, couldn't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back?	0

69114	It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie	0

B000ERNO0M:your_cat_will_love_this:carrie_crane_"craneca"	This is a wonderful item that your cat will love. I originally purchased a thermal mat from another website (more expensive with a pattern that I didn't like). My 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it, so I did a search and when I found this one, I ordered one for each of them. This cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that I just ordered 3 more, for my dad, sister and a friend to give to their cats. I've seen similar thermal cat mats for $50+. The pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux-sheepskin. My cats like both sides. You can throw them in the washing machine and fur doesn't stick to the smooth patterned side, which is nice. Of all of the cat beds I have purchased, including a heated window-mounted bed that plugged into the wall, this mat is my kitties' favorite thing to sleep on	1
0452265819:bitter_and_boring:nikki	I started reading this book hoping for the best.  In turn, I found that my hopes weren't fulfilled.  The beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more.  After the tone changed, the book became bitter and boring.  The characters lost their flare, and the whole book lost personality.  The book became dull and lost appeal to me.  The book's writing style, in the beginning, was original and fun.  Following the death of Little Red the book slowly fell apart, leaving me tempted to stop reading the book. If someone asked me to recommend a good book, this would not be the one	0

B0001XDOYK:terrible_quality:jacob_williams	We have the 49MHz Whisper Connect and love it (see our review of that one). We needed a second monitor to replace a 900MHz Fisher Price monitor that is 4+ years old, and decided to try this one out. We set the base across the room from our daughter and had her talk at her normal voice, and we could barely hear here with the volume turned up. We thought we must have a defective unit, so we returned it and got another, and we had the same problem. There is no interference or static with the monitor - but also no sound. We're very unhappy with it and would not recommend it	0
B000F7PIWI:walking_poles_make_working_out_a_complete_breeze!!:littlebee_"littlebee"	I purchased my Leki Nordic Walking Poles because I read somewhere that these poles would reduce stress on my hips and knees while walking.  That is totally true!  I have a congenital malformation in my right hip which prevents me from ever being able to run or jog as a means for exercise.  I do love to walk, but was hindered by the pain from my right hip.  By using the walking poles, I am able to walk quickly without any pain at all, even though I am actually using more muscle groups than I would if walking without the use of poles.  Walking alone, a person only uses about 50% of the large muscle groups.  Walking with LEKI Nordic Walking poles, one will use up to 90% of all the large muscle groups; this turns a simple 30 minute walk into a full-body workout without stress!!  I would not walk any other way now that I own my LEKI poles!	1

B000IXLEN6:love_this_addition_to_our_moon_sand_sets:angela_m._strosnider_"momof3"	My 5-year-old adores this addition to his moonsand play set. The kit includes enough sand to make cars and other items to "run over" with the included Monster Truck. He had a ball and still plays with it at least once or so a week after a month of me purchasing it. The new inserted play mat for the original blow up moonsand kit makes it that more fun for him to play like he's at the Monster Trucks show!	1

B000KFUK9Q:i_absolutely_love_this_phone!:h._beachum	My first blackberry and I love it! I wanted to stop lugging around a phone AND a rather heavy Dell Axim just to have contacts, calendar and task-to-do list. I wanted a phone that synched with Outlook and was a great phone.  The Pearl is definitely the BEST choice.  I didn't really care about internet, music or camera, but the cheapest $30 internet plan from Cingular lets me have unlmited internet and access to home email instantly - it's just great!  I bought the $40 1Gb card and now have about 150 mp3 songs and pictures on it.  I use the mp3 songs as ringtones and it's GREAT to be able to instantly recognize who's calling from the music.  Camera is ok - not great, but ok and very nice to have for on-the-spot photos that you don't want to lug around the regular digital for.  I actually emailed a picture on the spot - very cool.  Battery life is phenomenal so far.  However, I'm not a heavy user and I used the profiles to have phone automatically shut off from 2am to 6am every day.	1

B0006HVHCW:not_so_good:sanjiv_thakor	This heater died after a month of usage.  I would rather go to Walmart and buy a cheap one (which I did) and it has lasted me for 2 months so far (with heavy usage).  If that one breaks I can atleast drive down and return it Vs the hassle of Shipping it.	0
490387	I have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last. This is my first SLR and I am not in the least disappointed.

B00005NOF7:this_is_the_worst_toy_ever!:	It looks fun in the picture, but there is a major design flaw with this toy - the wheels stick out so far that when the rider tries to go they end up slamming their ankle into the tire.  Within 2 minutes of using this toy my son ripped open his ankle.  This toy should be recalled.  Do not buy it. I would send mine back, but we had already thrown out the packaging	0
394427	For years Discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science. Now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless. Very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science. After buying Discover since it's very inception I find it sad what has happened to this magazine. Check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	0
B000F6WHMS:not_much_for_taste,_but_effect_is_very_good:walker_"inthe_reign"	I tried this item just because it's a a ginseng snack.  I found it to be not particularly tasty, but the overall effect of increased stamina is true.  I'm not sure about spirulina in general, but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days	1
141720	If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.	0
B000H3FUXC:easy_to_use!:b._payne	This software is easy to use. It's like tax software, it ask questions, you answer. Has everything I wanted it for and a lot more. I would recommend it.Cheaper than a lawyer	1
B000E73MZY:15-5300_silent_magnetic_resistance_upright_bike:benjamin_anderson_"b._anderson"	I bought this on amazon and used the free shipping and received it about a week and a half later... Took it out of the box, it's pretty simple to put together (took about an hour). But after about 20 minutes of riding the bike on tension # 6 the rubber belt has flipped off it's wheel (like a bike chain off its gears). The bike is now completely useless as there is no resistance anymore. And I can't get to the belt to try and fix it because the cover is impossible to take off without breaking it. Tried calling customer service but they are only open on weekdays 9-5, going to have to call them from work on Monday.	0
B00009UHFU:goes_together_easily:d._cole	I enjoyed putting this together. The spacers kinda threw me until I realized you use 2 per pole under each corner of a shelf. I got it assembled then my daughter pointed out that the DVD shelves weren't spaced properly [CD sized] so I had to take it apart and redo it, but that wasn't too bad. The spacers snap apart easily enough, even for my feeble fingers.  It's not terribly sturdy [maybe I didn't get the poles screwed down tightly enough] but as long as it's in its permanent location, holds the multimedia well. I really like the way it looks. Bought this item for my teenager and will have to get myself one, too :	1
482165	I subscibe to this magazine.  Will not renew it either!  Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical.  It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount	0
596886	The traveling plot seemed like a take-off of 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles' - traveling from NY to Savannah vs traveling from Chicago to NY. Same sequence: airplane delays, then train occurrence, then bus, then jalopy-type car. But, since I totally enjoyed the Steve Martin movie, I also enjoyed 'Forces of Nature'. The writer even threw in some weather and fire, same as 'Trains, Planes, and Automobiles'. Because of the similarities, I rated it four stars instead of five.	1
B0002E2MCI:great_teaching_tool.:ronald_sears	Boomwhackers are wonderful for teaching children or adults elementary music.  They are virtually indestructible and can be use in a variety of teaching situations.  And that are very resonable in price.  I do recommend also purchasing the Octavator caps.	1
249401	Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there. I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.	0
168858	This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	1
B000FSVXQM:too_expensive_for_nothing_more_than_a_dvd_&_thin_plastic_mat:thomas	this is not quite what I was expecting - I thought the mat was at least electronic or something to provide feedback, however it's just a plain cheap filmsy plastic mat that really adds nothing to the whole cheerleading experience.  Also, the video really moves too fast for my 4 yr old daughter and just up frustrating her.  It might work okay for older kids, but it's not very good for the younger ones	0
B000LGFI9G:very_dissapointed_-_valentine's_day_nightmare:n._holter	I placed my order with little time to spare before Valentine's Day. Amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual!! However, to my disappointment, when I opened the box the item came in... it looked TERRIBLE. I though the price was a steal, but feel as if I paid way too much for what was received.	0
