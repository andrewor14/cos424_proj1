2179	I want to start by saying Fred Flare- shipped this product very fast!! And the transaction itself was very smooth. I do however, have extreme problems with the product itself. The product is not leather, its nylon, and it sort of looks cheap? The inside material is sued, but that's only the lining for the base of the wallet. Also, The wallet part is very hard to use. You cant really put too much in the wallet- The credit card slots are a little too snug, and there is no place for my I.D. The wallet included a small "note book" but it also doesn't fit in the wallet? I was very excited about this product, but now I feel duped. The pictures made the wallet seem like it was of higher quality, and that it was user friendly, but it's not. I do not recommend this product	0
106861	THe pants that I ordered for my size were very small. They weren't true to size at all. I would not recommend this item to anyone	0
215912	I have had plenty of pairs of Doc's but these are not the best for me........... they are not comfy and they tend to be a little tough to break in. As soon as I put them on and took ONE STEP ---- there right across the top of the shoe is a nice big crease......... It does not look nice and I am "ticked" about that...........plus I didnt expect the laces to have green and maroon colors mixed into the brown laces...... it looks dorky!	0
241758	The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose	0
329069	Suit was too small, not enough information available on the site for it. I called Amazon, but even the customer representative was not sure the size. I bought the suit as he suggested, but it is too small	0

516353	Perhaps it is my own fault for not reading more closely, or failing to question the somewhat ambiguous product description.  The fact is, I thought that I would be receiving 84 plastic stays (3x28), 28 each in 3 different sizes.  At $8.00, that seemed like a reasonable deal for plastic collar stays.  What I got, and I confess that the product description could be interpreted this way, was a total of 28 stays in assorted sizes.  When you add in the $4.00 I was charged for shipping (actual US Postal Service postage on the package was $1.84), this really is a poor deal compared to other available options.  About 43 cents for each plastic collar stay?  A bad choice	0
577589	I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.	0
B000EZXS32:cute_shoe_but_not_practical:taheerah_a._mcneil	I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy	0
B0007ZA0V2:passport_cover:kathleen_a._lyon	Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong.  Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response	0
B000FVBWYC:comfy_but_so_so_color_looks_different_in_pic:shiree_rose_trozera	Shoe is comfortable but the description says off white or white with beige.  Which leads you to think the color is mostly white.  The true color is neither!  There is absolutely NO WHITE in these shoes.  I purchased these shoes because I needed some white off/white shoes NOT beige shoes.  No I did not return them it's too much of a hassel to return things so I kept them and I have worn them once but do not like the color at all.  The style is not as cute as her others but they are still a great bargain.  The materials are an excellent quality.  If you like beige & earthtones you will like these shoes	0
B000CECRAA:i_never_received_this_item:amy_bond	I ordered this wool wrap at the beginning of December and never received the item. I am disappointed that this seller is ripping people off and plan to report the fact that my money was basically stolen from me. If people can't be honest in their transactions then online buying will eventually die out. Two thumbs down	0
B00009YPNN:don't_waste_your_money,_big_busted_gals!:stacy_kerr	I am a 38 FF, and I was hoping this would help hold me in while running - NOT! This bra is no better than my 18 hour bras and is double the price! I'm still in search of the bra that will hold me in! This one is going back	0
B000J45DOU:disappointed:momandrn	I received the night gown, tried it on, and actually hated it.  The built in bra was loose, as was the top and there was just too much fabric up top.  The straps are too wide.  The rest of the gown was okay, although it too seemed too drapey and long.	0
B000EJRX0W:too_small!:donna_gee	These tops were cute, for my 7 & 10 year old neices.  How in the world did they justify putting a size 2x on these things?	0
B0002TW1DI:too_much_fuzz:a._khan	these socks are okay, but after one wash, they were covered with so much fuzz and didnt look good. so the next pair i washed it with hand and dried alone to avoid the fuzz. also they are too warm socks	0
B000G2V59M:cute,_but_impossible_to_keep_on!:b._davis	These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day..	0

B0002IC652:very_cheap:kate	The other reviewer is spot on. These are pretty (but not truly mirrored) and they broke after only 4 weeks use.  I bought a pair of aviators at a gas station that was made of much sturdier materials for half the price.  Definitely not worth the $16	0
B00024F0MM:string_of_dissappointment:priscilla_v._rooyen	The one size fits all doesn't fit my slim body...and the item looks "made in China" if you know what I mean.  Rather try the double pearl thong or black single pearl thong.  They look much "classier" than the transparent beads with nylon string of the "string of bubbles" panty	0
B000HDXH14:word:jared_pace_"jrock"	First I tried these pants on in my size and I looked like Kramer in that episode where Jerry dares him to wear jeans.  It was ridiculous.  I went back  to the store and bought them a little bigger and they are the best pair of jeans I've ever owned.	0
B000A2T3EM:not_so_great:d._majumdar_"scientist_shopahollic"	I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose.	0

B000K6KYI2:not__what_i_expected:noryem_g._maldonado_"nory"	The shoes have sparkles all over and don't serve my purpose. I ordered them to use them for work but returned them because of the sparkle. A nice shoe to use during the night	0
B000CS9JP2:not_what_i_expected...:expected_much_more	I ordered 4 toddler long-sleeved tees' in the same size, I thought.  When I received the shipment, all 4 tees' were different sizes [even though they were all labeled the same size].  I have returned the items since the tees' run two sizes too small, and the workmanship is questionable, which translates into...that I will not be able to give this item to my loved one for Christmas.	0

B0002LY9E0:terrible_sandals!:christopher_w._damico_"macman"	THESE ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST THINGS i HAVE EVER BOUGHT. SERVES ME RIGHT FOR BY A SANDAL WITHOUT EVER HAVING TRIED IT ON. I WALKED AROUND THE BLOCK FROM MY HOUSE WITH THEM AND BARELY MADE IT HOME THEY HURT THE BOTTOMS OF MY FEET SO BADLY I MAY NEED TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY OFF OF WORK. THE PART OF THE SANDAL WHERE IT MIGHT NORMALLY BE FLAT AND CUSHIONED HAS SHARPENED PLASTIC SPIKES KNIFING THE SOLE OF YOUR FOOT. TAKE YOUR MONEY AND THROW IT RIGHT INTO THE GARBAGE AND SAVE YOURSELF THE MISERY OF EVER HAVING WORN THESE SO CALLED SANDALS. AND I LOVE ADIDAS	0
B000EDMQ7I:cute,_but_didn't_stand_up:puddle_jumper	These boots were super cute and earned rave reviews each time that I wore them out, although each boot split along the outside, toe sole after approximately 10 wears. These splits, although tiny, allowed my socks to get soaked when splashing through our giant West Coast puddles. I still wear them, but now only for fashion instead of function	0

FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN	0
B0007L7LYA:not_a_happy_camper:karen_carlson_"kc"	When I ordered this skort the description didn't say that it was a childs size.  So I complained to the site that I bought it from.  I asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn't specify that this was a childs size.  I wasted my money on shipping for an item I wouldn't have ordered if I had known it wasn't an adult sized item.  They didn't return my shipping	0
B000FY2MXE:displeased:paul_scott_jr.	When this product was ordered it was to be a 9 1/2 Wide when it was recieved it was a 9 1/2 Medium. We live in South America and they were brought by some friends and now we have shoes that don't fit in a different country	0
B000H8H9U4:cheap_25_cent_toy:vrwc_"dittohead"	Not only charged 8.99 for it, 6.99 for shipping! Its a cheap plastic toy. But my grandson begged for it, and against my beter judgement, I ordered it.	0
B000II9FHI:item_not_as_advertized:william_c._lambert	Item was called "Fleese" but was 80% cotton and looked & felt like a regular sweat shirt. To return an item to them, they give you free mailing, but they will deduct $5.95 off the refund for S&H. After calling them about this, they agreed to give us a full refund. But the refund will not show up until after 2 or 3 billing cycles. I doubt that makes many consumers happy. Champion makes a fine line of products, but I will never deal with them on line agai	0
B0002X4JIE:a_little_on_the_short_side:m._wong	I usually wear a men's medium waist for athletic shorts (Umbro, Adidas, Nike) and they usually fall just above my knee lengthwise.  Just to be safe I ordered a large.  The shorts barely made it past the midpoint of my thigh and my legs aren't overly long.  The waist fits well but if you're looking for a pair of workout shorts, I'd skip these unless you like to show a lot of leg.	0
B000HW162C:2_sizes_too_small!!!!!:stoodette_"a_good_snapshot_stops_a_moment_from_running_away"	i got the largest size they had (size 10) and my toes were crunched in. they fit my mom just barely, and she's a size 8. i wanted to get my money back for it, but it'd probably be more money just to ship the incredibly small slippers back, then it actually costed to begin with.	0
B000ETI3GA:very_tight_fit:ultar	This was my first online shoe order.  I figured it would be pretty safe since it was a slip-on.  I'm usually in a size 11 or 12, so I ordered a 12.  While my feet are pretty wide, I've never had to purchase wide shoes.	0

B000J3GDDQ:wrong_item:christie_harris	The wrong item was mailed to me. I checked the order after I recieved the item to make sure it wasn't a mistake on my part, and it wasn't. I recieved an armband for an iPod nano and I ordered an armband for an iPod video. Luckily I was able to sell it to a friend of mine instead of having to send it back.	0
B000ELZAPK:what_a_mess!:erika_r._byers	Company sent me two of one shirt and this shirt.  I ordered 3 different shirts.  This shirt is large in size but very short!  Not what I had expected.  Asked the company to fix the problem with the shirts as they were Christmas gifts for my daughter.  I received a fill form two weeks later with no correction to the problem.	0
B000BAWSYK:returned_items:eric_p._mantz	I ordered these items in mid June, and my credit card was billed on June 22.  However I discovered two weeks later that, despite your having billed my credit card for items being purchased from Andrew Christian, the order had never been sent to them.  I was then assured that the order would be completed promptly (I told them I needed the clothing by July 19, otherwise I would not need the items at all)).  The order was not given to UPS until July 17 with an expected delivery date of July 21. Consequently I directed UPS to return the order unopened.  The handling of the entire mess was slopppy, and the billing of my credit card two weeks before the order was even placed was unethical and shameful.	0
B000H4UR2A:not_impressed:trish_"trish"	I ordered these pajamas for a xmas gift for someone that loves Happy Bunny.  The pj's were cheaply made and the pants were very short...it didn't say anywhere in the description that that were capri length.  They were definitely not worth the price	0
B000BMVDPI:size_matters:b._gilbert	For slip on slippers-no hands required-these do not pass the test. The small lip in the back does more harm than good.I ordered 1/2 size large and it was not enough. If you have high arches go 1 1/2 sizes larger or look elsewhere. The synthetic upper was more sweaty than comfortable	0
B0002PCT0M:i_want_my_money_back:barbara_b._mcclintock	These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply	0
B000G7WMD0:way_too_short!!!:k._quinonez_"yeahhboi.com"	These are supposed to 3x boxers, that means they should be made for a big man.  Well they fit my boyfriend like little boy boxers. they were about 2 inches long. They were horrible for him.  He threw 2 of them out.	0
B000FCP1CU:not_typical_nine_west_quality:m._theobald	I have worn these shoes less than 5 times and the leather detailing has already worn away. The shoes look cheap, not typical of the nine west brand.  I would not purchase this item again. I thought I was getting a good deal but have simply added to my collection of boots that can be thrown on to do yard work.	0
B000JMYXU2:rise_is_too_short:ruth_w._stidger	These pants are fine if you have a very short rise, but I can't imagine that they would fit most people. I will be returning my order	0
B000A2I98I:ankle_pain:dream_seeker	I bought these shoes a few months ago because I liked the style of them. I wore them just about everyday. A couple of people started telling me "you walk kind of funny in those shoes". They caused my ankles to turn in.I was having ankle pain and my doctor confirmed it was from the shoes. The support (curves) of the shoes are poorly designed. I ran into another women wearing them and walking the same way. I asked her about them and she said she too was having ankle pain. I contacted the company who said I could mail them to the company (at my expense) and they would "inspect" them. If they felt it was a "manufacturers defect" they would replace them with the SAME product. Little good that would do. ALSO If they felt it was not a defect they would just send them back with a note explaining their decision.Don't waste your money and cause yourself pain too. The company may say "they stand by their merchandise" but they don't mean it!	0

B000EMVE3Q:don't_waste_your_money:joanne_t._mark_"jmark1062"	The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area.	0
B00008EF3Q:inferior_product_&_design_:r._r._weaver	I bought 2 Lilyette Embroidered Minimizer bra's here and both of them broke within one week.  I have never had such a negative experience with a product before.  Where the straps attach to the cup there is no strength in the attachment & they broke right away. Since I don't know how to get my money back or an adjustment, this cost me approx $60 for a loser of a purchase. My suggestion: Don't waste your money on this one	0

B0007XVUHM:back_to_the_drawing_board!:bowlin_pin	"Sling" is a misnomer for this gimmick...think "tourniquet" and you'll be closer to the reality.   There are several buttons and eyes on the "sling" to adjust the fit.  I tried every configuration, and they all felt too tight.  A snug fit would be more tolerable if the thing stayed put, but my experience was the same as that of other reviewers:  the noose slipped off after an hour or so of walking around.   Despite the problems with the strap, I like the briefs.  My recommendation is to buy briefs sans strap.  The sling technology needs more R&D before it's ready for the Big time	0
B000GAY492:do_not_order_from_amazon_or_macys_:joanna_lee	I ordered this product for a friend's bday since I got these same boots and loved them.  I waited weeks and weeks for her to call me and tell me how much she loves them.  Except it NEVER happened.  I was told the product went out over 2 weeks ago, I call amazon and they tell me to call macys.  I call Macys and they tell me to call amazon.  I've been told the item went out and must have gotten lost in the mail.  Then i am told the product was never sent out cuz it's been backordered and that Aerosoles cancelled the order.  Although now i've told my friend she's getting these boots and now she's not.  I've also been charged for these boots over 2 weeks ago and have made half a dozen calls to amazon and macys and had to explain this whole story to 10 different ppl and spent over 2 hrs of my LIFE trying to get this resolved.  Do yourself a favor and go buy this at the store or directly w/ Aerosoles.  I will never buy anything from amazon or macys online again.  WORST customer service ever and I am SOOOOO pissed right now	0
B000ARL19C:top_leather_scuffed_on_first_wear:j._lian_"webshopper1"	The shoes look and wear great.  However, the leather is pretty weak.  I think I must have kicked a table leg or something on my frist outing in them.  Now the tip of my left shoe has a quarter-size scuff on it.  I will have to try to cover it up by oiling it.  Obviously I don't think this pair will last long at all	0

B0008MFDDE:not_supportive_for_larger_sizes:a_momma	I was looking forward to this being a great nursing bra - I loved the cotton, one-hand closures, and the lack of underwires.  It felt and looked great when I tried it on, but after a few hours of wearing, it had the classic problem of riding up in the back.  Eventually I gave up wearing it at all.  I bought mine in a boutique where I was professionally fitted, so I had the right size (34F).  I'd recommend a Bravada bra for larger sizes, they consistently fit great and stay put.	0

B000FFANUW:great_looking_but_not_functional:jennifer_consiglio	I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry	0
B000LSGSPW:ow!:c.p.	I bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately, interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts.  I usually lift weights, have no prior injuries, and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form (I played a college sport, etc.).  After a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that I could barely move them regularly.  It was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier (free weights included).  Perhaps I was doing the exercises incorrectly, but that seems like a real risk with a video like this.	0
B000G1IL3Q:no_brand,_no_directions,_no_value:j._d._f._ml	While this product appears very nice in pictures and upon arrival, it does not function to transmit the IPOD via FM frequency.  It can hook to the IPOD, cradle the IOPD and charge the IPOD, but it does not transmit.  The product was made in China but has no other company information to search for techincal assistance or return.  While I could probably process back through Amazon and the seller, it is not worth my effort.	0
B0002VG57O:somehow_not_as_good_as_birks:l._supheert	They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me	0

This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive	0
B000686I6G:i_ordered_a_bathrobe_but_got_a_tent.:dr._c._j._lovelace	The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)	0

B0002TW0JS:very_uncomfortable:j._bickmore	These socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams. If this sort of design bothers you (as it does me), then these are not the socks for you. These socks cause a lot of discomfort for me	0
B0002LI8J2:big_mistake!:robert_l._fishell	These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product	0
B000BNPN3U:no_luv_from_luvable_friends_-_poor_quality:j._gottlieb	I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!	0
B000B0SNV2:cant_review_it__because_it_was_never_shipped:an_avid_movie_buff	I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item	0

B0001J3Z2U:not_exactly_as_pictured:john_delano	Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps	0
B0006TP0ZU:no_support,_ughhhhhhh,_also_didn't_last.......:janet_d._"rock_goddess"	I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..	0
B000JUEV5Q:pashmina_shawl:k._engels_"kristy"	The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all	0

B000FBX092:not_that_great:pa_student	I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic	0
B0002FHFQ0:xl__???__whatever!:s._klein_"max's_mom"	I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL???	0

B00006X99Q:poor_quality:traildog	I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.	0
B00086HEZA:terrible_shoes!!!:ss_"ss"	I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in	0

B0002U39M4:very_disappointed:zodiac_zoo_"zz"	I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products.	0
B000E9VFWO:save_your_money_and_get_real_birks:shasta's_d	I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.	0

B000CRG0UA:horrible_quality!:e._waller	These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are	0
B000CFERYS:very_hard_to_keep_clean!:elizabeth_sippel	Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them	0
B0006TOZZG:players_nylon_boxers:mike	These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.	0

B000B5TWJ4:slip_sliding_away:knitting_fan	At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.	0
B00008ID1O:poor_quality:indigo_girl	I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices	0
B0007WJ1Q0:thin_yoga_strap:nancy_johns_mohlere_"nancy_j._mohlere"	This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one.	0
B00067IF22:ridiculous_sizing:e._waller	I got these for my son before he arrived in the 0-3 mos size (blue).  They weren't even blue, they were purple.  And, they were so big they fit my 14 mo old, but the arms were too short for her to wear them either!  What a waste of money	0

B000790YG4:very_comfortable,_but_very_light_for_a_work_boot.:ronald_l._russell	This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers.	0
B0007OES3E:oops:buttercup	I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith..	0
B0007IN3EU:not_true_to_size:l._pascal_"shoe_lover"	I bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size, I bought an 11.5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe. Be very caefull when buying I suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size	0
B000EBC4PY:get_what_you_pay_for:t._morgan	I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.	0
B0007OQ8M8:boohoo:e._little_"nodress4me"	I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr	0
B000BPUHIO:poorly_made:goldilocks_"katie"	These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.	0
B000AP4ZZG:dissatisfied:mary_g._mccall	This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders	0
B000145UKA:great_comfort_-_poor_quality:trisha_a._nonte	I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire	0
B000GZYJL0:quality_control:steven_c._gerhartz	I bought these based on a previous review. After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart. Maybe the quality control person was out that day??? I returned them and got a full refund	0

B000FL00E0:lousy_design:anonymous	There was no picture of this selection, so I guessed it was a "ringer" type t-shirt.  Instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching.  I never wore it, but gave it to Goodwill	0

B0009C9BUY:great_looking_shoes,_terrible_quality:donald_n._bernier	These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them	0

B0007TC03Y:review:natalie_g._rossman	The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this	0
B000HVYPG2:not_what_you_expect:validated_in_seattle	You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.

"You get what you pay for" applies to this product	0
B000MRETQ2:capris:elly_slama_"elly"	This product was disappointing.  Not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected.  I guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit	0
B000AS81N0:no_cotton:e._boscov	I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you	0

B000E1VHBQ:total_crap_boots!:z._heward	I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and "break them in" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.

B000B8LTHY:no_headache_midsize_purple_visor:susan_a._smith	The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors.	0
B000BNQDX4:if_the_shoe_fits...:carl_m._evans_"mooncrow"	I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?	0

B000F9YQF6:unsatisfied:grimey's_mom	My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give.

B00024R7QY:more_trouble_than_it's_worth:emily's_mom	I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..	0
B0007WLQZE:poor_design:california_grandmother	I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head	0
B000LGGYM6:indian_print_cotton_full_length_ladies_skirt_:erica_l._morgan	There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.	0
B0001YR20G:getting_impatient:james_e._straut	the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it	0
B0000A0RS3:maternity_shorts_:robyn_m._lowenstein_"robyn"	just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them.	0
B000C7J2CS:not_received:j._cage_"air_force_spouse"	I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.	0
B000C9TDIY:defective_merchandise:c._schulze	The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals.  I have had these sandals before and this didn't happen.  Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower, and thus more fragile, nubs.  All I know is, they are junk	0
B000J44HJW:cute_but_not_a_good_fabric:rebecca_woods	These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear	0
B0007Y9OEW:not_what_i_ordered:tamora_l._skelly	The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement.	0
B0008MF4DS:terrible!:a._cansino_"new_mommy"	I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!	0
B000HVYPH6:waste_of_money:mary_"mary"	VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle	0
B00064CI5A:strange_looking_visor:summer_lover_"patty"	This visor is square in shape instead of oval, I have never seen a square visor before. It looks very strange.  Also, it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be, it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head.  I will not be wearing mine	0
B0001IA06U:terrible_bra:m._cardenas_"breastfeeding_mama"	Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra	0
B000AR9SI8:boots_shipped_did_not_look_the_same_as_on_website:lee_price_"lee4956"	I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as	0
B000GTSHLE:did_not_work_for_me:erin_kerwin	Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable	0
B0007P9374:not_water_proof:peggy_j._baillie_"d._baillie"	This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now	0
B000GDKV8C:don't_bother:a._neel	A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother	0
B000EORB4K:disappointed...:babs	I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..	0
B000E4AG4W:buy_at_your_own_risk:brooke_"turtle"	These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.	0
B000HC5N3A:live_up_to_promise:t._erickson	The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars	0
B00009ET0W:too_large_-_didn't_like:jeanne_allen_"jinx_pacific"	These two packets of panties were too large.  I also didn't like the cotton.  Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it, but  I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn't like them.	0
B000CRYY8U:sizes_are_cut_small:d._drew	The shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly.  Be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small.  Also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive	0
B0002ZQUAW:me_too:gary_bingaman	I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time	0
B000JKTJMQ:bad_boots:marilyn_mccauley	I bought these boots for my husbamd. He only had them less than one week and the soles were breaking down. I will never purchase them again....	0
B000FK17FM:quality(plush?)of_hooded_terry_bathrobe:r._hartman	Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton. If plush means thick material this is not. It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made--Sears, J.C. Penney.Does not llook durable	0
B0001EKNWU:2_sizes_smaller_than_size_specified:ivan_vadenev_"ivan"	This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order. I ordered a size 9, but wasn't able to wear them. I gave them to my little brother who's a size 7, they fit him perfectly	0
B000FL18AK:a_paper_bag...:t._gage	While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy. When it came in the mail today, it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [which I really like!]. I was anxious to see what it was like.	0
B000NDTKUA:item_send_was_not_new:drew_scales	Item send was not new. Obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use. Also a rip in the design	0
B0009R3HB8:poor_quality,_cheaply_made.:k._burlingame_"kitten"	We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field(mainly insulation instalation) which requires him to climb in high places, walk on trusses, and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions. In my opinion these boots DO NOT have "heavy duty" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying "Made in China" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them. If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they're perfect	0
B000B67F5G:didn't_fit_well_and_i_was_allergic_to_the_adhesive:tigress_"music,_movie_&_book_goddess"	Like I said, they didn't fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive. :	0
B000HW9BVK:don't__do_it:dr._samer_k._zawaideh	I bought this item, and was very disappointed when I received it and tried it on. The mock crocodile leather looks very cheap...the "leather" of the shoe is very hard and I could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. After which I threw the shoe in the trash....it was such a waste of money...do not think of buying it..	0
B0002UCERU:don't_buy_this_product:y._ismail	It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says "size S fits 26-36")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.	0

B0000YWCRA:what_size_is_it?:"lk-shinonome"	I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order	0

B000BB6DPE:this_is_not_real:keith_e._mayo	I am tired of companies making money off of fakes.  The U.S. Government did not buy their field jackets from China.  These M65 O.D. Green Field Jackets are not real--They are a mid-grade reproductions	0
B000B5ULC6:didn't_receive_it_on_time.:a._huddleston	I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance, and it arrived too late for me to wear it.  It's still in the package in my closet.  Maybe next year..	0
B0000AA3WC:this_is_a_wicked_bad_idea.:s._petralia_"doctor_of_ideas"	If your name were Johnny Damon, maybe.  But you're bagging groceries at the Star Market for $7.25/hour.  Is this jersey really worth a day's pay to you?  The chicks aren't gonna be fooled into thinking you're on the team.  The Sox won't vote you a World Series share.  Your mom's gonna throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it, and you're gonna wish you had that money back when your buddy Tommy is selling his old Malibu.	0
B000FE76AI:don't_buy_from_this_company!_poor_poor_customer_service:christine_m._andrews	I ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print. I was sent TWO brown wristlets, the return process was difficult, and when I returned the product I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR THE CORRECT PRODUCT!!	0
B0007PIHQ2:don't_buy_this_if_you_want_control:candy_l._lawson_"candy_bright"	The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief	0
B000K9ZBFK:not_sturdy:ying_s._yu_"aysweetie"	This corset is not well made at all.  It's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear.  (I wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top.	0
B00065OX9I:worthless:m._burch	Bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather - worthless - no heat detected - you really feel the bulky wire if you don't put them on exactly right - heavy d-cell draws down the sock on your leg - don't bother, put the extra 25 bucks into your boots	0
72518	GOOD LOOKING KICKS IF YOUR KICKIN IT OLD SCHOOL LIKE ME. AND COMFORTABLE. AND RELATIVELY CHEAP. I'LL ALWAYS KEEP A PAIR OF STAN SMITH'S AROUND FOR WEEKENDS	1
119913	Finally I have found a quality brand of swimsuit I can order on line and know it will fit.  I'm a daily swimmer who is long-bodied.  This particular style fit great when it arrived; it arrived quickly within four days; shipping was free; and the lycra material is the most resilient I know given the chlorine bashing my suits get.  Please continue to sell this particular item at a price lower than the sports stores.  Thanks!!	1
255967	Nice shirt. Well made. Good price. What more can I say	1
434727	With a good selection of colors to go with the casual style, to say I love these shoes is an understatement. They are very comfortable, and have grown on me so much, they are about the only casual style shoes I have bought in the past few years	1
578574	I bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open  nearly to the waist, and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little, nobody would be able to see anything. The nude ones were practically the same color as my skin, so they were perfect. They also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold. The best part was, they didn't feel weird at all	1
B0006OT2FO:my_favorite_sleep_tee_ever!:n._g._mackie	I can only ditto what the other 5-star reviewers have already said. I have 1 of the 41" for summer and now 2 of the 50" for fall and winter. The colors remain solid after mutiple washes, and the price is great for the quality of these sleep shirts. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend! ngmackie, Dunwoody, GA	1
B0002JTUPU:the_product_is_very_good_but:milton_e._pinzon	Dont buy it from Andrew Christian, i wrote them online several times and never, not once, got an answer from them, i ended up buying them some other place	1
B0000TW9VO:great_coat:t._lee	My husband loves this coat. He wears it all winter. If you are someone that doesnt like a bulky exceptionally warm lined coat this is it. He is uncomfortable in something like down because it is too sweaty but this is perfect. Warm enough and lightweight and comfortable. THis is the second one he has purchased.	1
B000J45DOU:highly_recommended_for_pregnant_&_pumping/nursing_mums:a._chaib_"not_your_mainstream_mom"	I just received two of these bra-less nursing nightgowns (sm), a robe (sm/m), and the two piece tank pj set (sm).  I'm almost nine months pregnant and have gained 50ish pounds and despite the other review about not fitting during pregnancy, it (and the other items) fits and stretches well while holding its shape.  I will wear this now and indefinitely after the baby comes: it's apparent that it will fit me well after baby too.	1
B000GA75P2:great:janelle_reagan	Service was very quick, and they were having a free shipping special, so it was very well priced	1
B000G33DPU:almost_perfect:joseph_poalillo	I'm very satisfied with this purchase. The jeans are great quality for the price. However, it was not stated that they would be the (very)long length that they were. I had to alter them, which was an inconvenience	1
B000G7WVSG:their_claim:norbert_f._reynders	THEY CALL THEIR SOCKS THE "WORLDS SOFTEST MEN'S CLASSIC CREW SOCK" AND LET ME TELL YOU ITS THE TRUTH. BEEN LOOKING FOR A PAIR OF RED SOCKS FOR WEEKS, WITH OUT SUCCESS. THEY MAY NOT BE THE SHADE OF RED I WANTED BUT THEY ARE THE BEST IN FIT AND QUALITY. NOW FIND ME THE "RED SHADE" I'M LOOKING FOR AND I'LL BE EVEN MORE PLEASED.	1
B0002T6DXC:there's_a_reason_you_wear_fur!:deirdre_root	Genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear! An excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather, well worth the money spent.	1
B000ASBMAY:awesome_for_20_bucks:j._ream	Great buy for 20 bucks. They look nice and fit well. They are distressed but it is not as bad as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. They look nice with jeans and a dark shirt. Pretty comfy too	1
B000AS7GJU:slippers:a._krueger_"amarie"	I liked the timeliness that the merchandise arrived. They fit my husband's feet well and he likes them. The only down side is that when he tried to tighten them the leather lace broke and so now we have to try to find something like it to fix the lace.	1
B000FNSM9I:so_unusual!:dreampeaceluv444	I get compliments every time I wear this. I took a chance, because I tend to be a bit plump. As other reviewers noted, the sleeves do run snug. But otherwise it's a great jacket at a great price. The grommets are just so fun.It is fully lined. I just love this modern addition,and it's not too "young" feeling, just right.	1
B0002OQGAW:good_quality_silk:anna_v._onan_"silk_enthusiast"	Of all men's silk PJs that I purchased over the years for my husband this is one of the best.  The fabric has a nice heavy weight to it and it survives machine washing well.  After reading other customers' reviews, I purchased a medium size for a person who usually wears size M and occasionally L.  It turned out too small.  I would recommend going one size up	1
B0002X98GM:cute_bodysuits:j.a.larson_"grant~n~grace_mommy"	Very cute tops, for a nice price.  They wash up good.  They do run a little big, just so you are aware	1
B000GRYM0Q:great_value:antonio_franco	My son loved these jeans.  The jeans were very comfortable. The best thing about them was that because my son is so thin the elastic adjustments were perfect	1
B000OS51FW:it_is_real_nice:william_wasylk	The item is much better than any others that I have got through out the years. It should last a long time. Not rip easy. It feels very sturdy. I think it is real good	1
B0006FYR8A:i_wear_underwear_like_this_sometimes:s._kochel_"sam_k"	When I play basketball, or in the past when I did Jiu-Jitsu then too. Anyway, they keep me warm and tight like a brace in the way that so my muscels don't pull or cramp. Anyway, I guess they look o.k. too, but who would see them anyway...THEY'RE UNDERWEAR!!!!	1
B000AON0Q2:comfy_for_days:westley_burke	These shoes keep my feet cozy all the way through a twelve hour shift, walking on concrete floors	1
B000EXVTJE:be_cautious:l._casey	This is a beautiful shoe by Rockport, but beware, it runs really narrow.  I even went a size up from my usual to compensate.  I ended-up sending them back anyway.  So if your foot is on the narrow side you may enjoy this sandal	1
B0002MHUSQ:love_em:j._ferkler_"happy_walker"	These are the first mootsies tootsies I have owned and I love em.Since then I have bought another pair of loafers and a pair of their boots.  These shoes are very comfortable	1
B000144ROK:out_of_this_world...:livin'_the_good_life	I originally started wearing Hanky Panky thong panties b/c my husband purchased some for me awhile back. Recently I stepped out of the box and ordered the low rise thong panty and again I'm thrilled.	1
B000CRGVEU:super_sandals:sally_a._white_"bkpr_mom"	These are wonderful sandals. Tried to find flat slingback sandals in the stores but to no avail. Finally did the right thing and went online. Great Sandals at a very reasonable price. You won't be sorry if you purchase these. Very stylish and very comfortable	1
B0006HTWQ0:amazing:will	Like the photo implies, and like most 2(x)ist men's products, this underwear is sexy, comfortable, flattering and made of quality materials.	1
B000KM3LAE:love_them!!:lori_g_klaassen_"l_clawsun"	I love these Crocs!  They are much more comfortable than the original style, and I like the two tone color combo.  I wear them even in the winter	1
B000IJUOCM:love_this_huge_bag!!!:mrs.mark_"d.costello"	I just received this bag today and I am absolutely in love with it.This bag looks alot more expensive then it is and the inside is HUGE!!! With a zip pocket and additional large pocket and smaller one that is perfect for my mp3 player. My husband got it 100% right with this little surprise. So if you enjoy a large bag that looks great on your arm this one is it expecially for the price!!!	1

B0002M0HF4:good_stuff:s_gunter	Good quality jeans at an affordable price. Size is just right, quite comfortable	1
B000CQIXAQ:comfortable,_easy_on-off:marcia_inman	Super comfortable.  Provides great support/coverage.  Love the front zipper.  No fighting to get over your head.	1
B0002PCD4O:silk_boxers:smf	They were a nice quality, nicely priced, and were shipped promptly.  I would buy this brand again	1
B0002ADECO:best_toiletry_bag_-_no_spilling_of_toiletries_in_your_suitcase!:k._cushmore	Love this Kept Couture Toiletry Kit. I actually own two of them and give them as gifts during the holidays to my friends. The bag has a vinyl liner which is extremely helpful when your shampoo bottle leaks during travel. It keeps the leaky goods all inside - won't ruin the other stuff in your suitcase. And, it's a perfect size. It can hold about 10 days' worth of toiletries.	1
B0006TPPJ6:isotoner_slippers_are_excellent_:merryl_j._rosenthal	These black satin Isotoner slippers are extremely comfortable and fit extremely well. They are flexible enough to mold to the shape of your feet but strong enough to cushion your feet, as well. They are well worth the purchase	1
B000J13WFK:teenage_daughter_loves_them!:k._escher_"pagancook"	I bought these slippers as a Christams gift for my 16 year old daughter, she was very happy to get them as I guess they are the "in" thing for teenagers in her school. She loves them and actually wears them to school they are so comfy! Price is high, but they are well made and will last much longer than the typical slipper, these are more like shoes than slippers. The sheep skin & wool lining is very sturdy & luxerious	1
B000H85Q3G:home_knitting_without_having_to_knit:lynn_s._hendricks_"wordmama"	This is a lovely fat scarf that looks like it was hand-knitted from scraps, just like I used to do before I got bored with knitting. It's squishy and warm and the perfect combination of colors for me; I just cut off the tag and people think I made it myself. (Don't tell!)	1
B0007NKFHS:finally_jeans_that_fit!:tamara_j._brand_"mara_brand"	I love these jeans -- I have 3 pair and they are the only jeans I wear.  Just enough stretch to be comfy but not too tight.  I wear a size 14 and these jeans fit me great.	1
B000FI72YY:great_sweatpants:patricia_a._wert	These sweatpants are extremely comfortable, reasonably priced and come in a variety of colors...Definetly a great buy..	1
B0007UON3S:wow:s._darnell	This is great.  I measured before I put it on & after.  I lost over 2 inches.  I highly recommend this	1
B000BC1B78:nice_bag:c._palm	It is perfect for my three year old to carry his toys...instead of me carrying them!!!	1
B000HGFVF6:fantastic_boots:m._perry	These boots fit like a glove and are so sleek looking.  They are comfortable and a great buy.  A nice pair of black boots is essential to any wardrobe	1
B000HCNHV0:urbantrack_shoes:gilbert_giancana	Love them.  They feel as comfortable as tennis shoes, and give the right support when doing a lot of walking, but at the same time they look more hip and dressier then tennis shoes	1
B0006A7Y08:sharp-looking_tank_top:d._furlong_"dustygirl"	I bought this tank in red & the color of the fabric is wonderfully vibrant.  The quality of the fabric is so nice that I wore the top to dinner with a printed skirt & received several compliments on the outfit.  Caution! This style runs about 1 size small.  Athletica offers excellent, personalized customer service and every one of the 10 tank tops I ordered were of a quality for which some brands cost as much as $38.	1
B000ARH0CY:love_these_shoes!:g._keller	GREAT price. I have another pair of these shoes I bought elsewhere at twice this price. Very comfortable. True to size.	1
B000FCP1CU:very_comfy.:sam_p.	These boots look good with jeans. Can be loose, but comfortable with thick socks	1
B0000BZZ2K:great_item:garry_m._werner	This item is great - study and well worth the money - light weight =- the only negative review would be with the company that I purchased from - they did not participate in the sale the site was running. Other than that - they filled the order fast and was pleased with the service and the quality of this briefcase	1
B000ARF6PM:lucky_me.:andrew_yang	Skechers just seem to fit my feet well. Lucky me. These were inexpensive, solidly constructed, comfortable, and (at least in my eyes) stylish. What more could I ask for in a casual shoe	1
B000EG910A:high_sierra_a.t._gear_access_36_in._drop-bottom_wheeled_duffle_at202_:jeffrey_w._cain	This product is great. Their are a ton of different ways to use this bag. From rolling it to carrying it like a backpack. I would advise anyone looking for luggage to look at this piece and no other. It is great.	1
B000BL8QD6:my_butt_looks_great!:tay_tay	Most flattering yoga pants I've ever worn.  I have an akward figure, long waist, big butt, a little pot belly, but these pants look and feel great.  Plus, I've heard the company pays a living wage to thier workers.  I want 10 pairs	1
B0000A16QB:youth_tiki_barber_jersey:douglas_barta	My 6-yr. old is football nuts right now and he loves his jerseys!  Great product and very well made.  Can also be very versatile worn by itself in the summer and with a shirt underneath in the winter	1
B00080HE7O:dopp_traditional_leather_kit:gregory_zagrubski	This was a long over due replacement for the Dopp kit that was given to me when I left for Vietnam. Its changed very little and is still of fine quality. I expect it will provide all the use I'll ever need	1
B000JN9M16:cool_but_small:pinxi	they were slightly small and a tad too stiff.	1
B00008RS9E:comfortable,_practical:billacorn	I have owned a pair of these a year or more and have probably laundered them 30-40 times.  They are very comfortable for me, though comfort is highly variable for each person.  The material is light weight but appears of good quality and I do not detect any deterioriation. At first I was concerned about the elastic which appeared narrow and weak, but it still feels as strong as when new and holds fine.  I will purchase more of these to have in a mix of styles.	1
B0007OW804:5-star_russell_t-shirts:marti_eastman_"ssavvystuff"	Russell!  I really wouldn't buy any other kind.  Too bad they don't make concert T-shirts!  Great material, long-lasting.  The best	1
B000JJJDFA:men's_black_dress_vest_necktie_set_for_suit_or_tuxedo_xxxl:barbara_fischer	This item was as I expected as far as the description, it is the quality I expected and I am pleased with it.  However, I bought it one size too large to be safe and it was so small it barely fit (It fit the way I feared the 2-X would fit that's why I bought the 3-X).  Don't know if it was mis-sized or what	1
B000E19P4M:10_stars:j._horn	I love these shoes...in fact I ordered another pair in black.  They are very comfortable and look cute.  Hey...can't beat that	1
B000AI0UGQ:great_umbrella_for_wind_&_rain:just_a_cool_"x-box_mom"	Got this for my father.  He loves it.  Great coverage.  Easy to use	1
B000JZOCZA:good_times!:andrew_rosett_"realize_your_dreams"	Whoever said the 80's are making a comeback wasn't lying!  I love American Apparel clothing especially this deep V-neck shirt.  Just know that it really is deep!  I'm only in my twenties but I almost feel like an older man when I wear this shirt; cut lower than other V-necks your chest hair is bound to hang out!  If your cool with that then go buy the shirt cause it can't get any more comfortable than it already is!  Honestly, I probably won't wear it anywhere other than the gym and home, but I still love it	1
B000J3AF5S:bearpaw_boots:lisa_o'brien	Boots are warm & Cozy. However, the color was much lighter than pictured...not the end of the world. Also, the shipping took longer than expected	1
B000J4JWWE:sansa_skin:s._r._sullivan	This product is really GREAT for this Sansa e260 I purchased. Strongly recommend it this Mp3 player. It helps grip, bottons work better, and looks "cool"	1
B0006H0PLG:just_fine:isabelle_herbert_"essex_girl"	These are basically plain black yoga pants but they fit fine, are good quality and have washed fine without shrinking.  It's hard to rhapsodise about them but they are more than adequate.	1
B000F34FXA:comfort_with_height,_finally!:h._sorensen_"sorencj"	Awesome shoe!! Very comfortable on my feet. Even though it's high healed sneacker you really don't fee too much of height and none of it's negetive side affects. I can actually run in this. Only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really HOT wearing it. I would recommend wearing thin sox. I originaly brought Dark Brown in size 7 (normally wear 6 or 6 1/2 size shoe) but had to return it to get 6. way too big. It's  wider than I'm used to even though I have wide feet; offers plenty of toe room.  If they offer 6 1/2 size , it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter. Unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered. I wanted to buy Black in 6 also, but 7 is too big and  smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now	1
B0006TPPLO:slippers:c._sue_hess_"just_love_to_read"	I could not find these slippers in our local stores.  I had two pair that were worn out and wanted exactly the same item.  I ordered them, they arrived and I love them.  It was a very easy, customer friendly process	1
B00063E7D2:finally_!:jon_d._andreas	IF OTHER UNDERWARE BINDS YOU, YOU HAVE FINALLY FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T. THE POUCH IS VERY LARGE, LOTS OF ROOM! I BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL DOZEN AND THREW ALL MY OTHER BRANDS AWAY	1
B000CCIPWQ:tiedown:town_clerk	This item was just what I was looking for.  I did not want a tie tack to ruin my husband's ties or a tie bar.  It is simple to use and does the job of keeping his tie from moving.	1
B0002VG57O:awesome:tara_hall	They are awesome, only tricky part is making sure you get the right size, my husband and I love them	1

B0007XS0NY:works_as_advertised:m._schnitzer	I've owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use, proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one's pocket for spare change	1

B0006TP046:the_best_so_far!:barbara_forbish_"the_queen_of_everything"	have spent years looking for a bra that feels good, does what it's supposed to and didn't make you wish you could get home & slip out of something so uncomfortable... at last i think i'm at the end of my search.  very comfortable, great support and can go hours before i start thinking about jammies.  only thing that would make this bra better would be padded straps	1

B000BH90T4:i_would_have_given_5_stars,_but...:pn_"pn_in_dc"	They looks nice, and fit really well, however, not so soft like some other Clarks/Indigo.	1
B000I30CIE:love_the_wheels:janice_l._macdonald	The sneakers are great.  My son loves the wheels on the side	1
B000FNK6H4:review_for_my_black_napa_leather_mini_backpack_purse:master_chopper_"tc"	I love the feel and multiple spaces available the only problem/fear is that I have had things fall out of it when snapped and string tight.  I would give it a 5 star if there was a zipper option to keep items secured	1
B000HCL1OA:nice_dress,_good_price:ms._s._corvalan_"susie"	For the price it's a nice dress.  Check your size carefully.  I'm normally a 29 waist in jeans, usually size 6, sometimes an 8.  I ordered a Large and it fits with only a little room, but a Medium would have been too small.  Slim through waist and flares out to the sides more than I expected it to.	1
B000FLT8D4:comfortable_and_good_looking:anna_lang	I like this dress. I am medium sized and bought size Medium and the dress fits just like on the model shown, with even a little extra. I think even if I would of get size Small it would still fit well with more "trim fit" look. It is basically like a super long tank with body contour. Nice to wear around house when you just want to quickly through something on, but also want to look good in it. (It is way more flattering than wearing boyfriend's long tea-shirt, if you understand what I am saying). It is soft, comfortable, cozy, beautiful color. I am very pleased with this product.	1
B000FC56AC:beautiful_silk_scarf:caleb_e._stephens	My wife shopped around at Amazon looking for her grandmother's 88th b-day (coming up soon) and came across handmade hadong silk scarf.  Every silk scarf she came across she would say, "What a beautiful and gorgeous hadong silk scarfs they are."  Before she found Vietmade Silk Scarfs at Amazon, she had looked online stores at Macy's, Nordstorm, JcPennies, but couldn't really compare with the ones Vietmade made.  I agree with my wife when she said, "This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.  My wife and I definately recommend this place and we'll buy a few more hadong silk scarfs in near future.  Also, delivery was on schedule, good packaging and love the scarfs!	1
B0007TYOO2:review_of_smart_tags_"big_and_bold":b._bailey	This product is exactly as described and was purchased as an additional means of identifying luggage at the airport baggage claim (so many types of luggage are similar in style and color, we've had trouble in the past).  Several of our family members were given new luggage for Christmas and these tags were included. These tags are big, bright lime green and can be easily seen. No more headaches in trying to find our luggage.	1
B000FFTH0O:like_having_air_conditioning_on_your_bike:drew_commins	Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down.	1
B00078SICW:review_for_jerzees_100%_cotton_shooter_t-shirt_red_men's_2x_:owen_samuel	I am very happy with the above purchase.I am very impressed with the arrival and condition of the item. I like it because it fits well and when you wear it, you feel quite cool. Will shop agai	1
B000A3NQ7G:good_sale:captain_morgan_"buster"	I was a little nervous about ordering clothing from the internet.  Not knowing if it would fit.  I think that the sizing chart used for this particular product works well because the produt turned out to fit just right.  Also, the picture is on key with the actual product.  My loved it and so do I	1
B000KBNFH4:remember,_this_is_italian_sizing!:sean_l._lane	These sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and I just bought another one in a different color.  They feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed Napoletana designer, Ermenegildo Zegna.	1
B0002OQDXM:review_of_silk_robe:l._m._bonucchi_"laura_b"	The robe was made of a very high quality fabric and held up very well! The color and tecture of the silk was truly beautiful.	1
B00008ZAQU:very_comfortable_and_easy_to_use:laura_"mother_of_two"	I've tried 6 different nursing bras. This one, with the center snap closure, is the easiest to use. It is also the lightest and most comfortable, while providing good support. My only complaint is that after about 50 washes the underwire begins to poke free from the fabric. Even when I try to sew it back into place, it breaks loose after a few washes. Perhaps if I handwashed the bra instead of using a machine, it would last longer. This bra is less durabe than my other nursing bras (particularly the Leading Lady bra, which seems to be indestructible), but it is well worth the sacrifice for comfort, lightness, and ease of use. It is by far my favorite	1
B000G00XT2:great_snowbroading_pants:alyssa_l._williams	I love these pants!!!! i'm a first time Boarder and I wasn't cold at all!!! Deffinately a Great BUY	1
B0002LMC62:it's_why_i_got_it:binky_"two_sticks"	It's thin, so you can wear something over it.  And it helps keep the chill out.	1
B000EQRYI6:great_shoes:rebeca_a._collazo	I bought as a gift for my sister in law and she absolutely loved them. These are some great looking shoes.	1
B0006TT0E2:long_lasting,_great_shape_and_support:bon	I had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders, and would support my breast. This one did both.  This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding "it all" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet	1
B0002U39M4:socks_for_son:b._moss_"charitybsm"	I searched the Internet for a particular type of sock that my son likes, but discovered they were no longer manufactured.  So I went to Amazon to see what they offered and decided to try the Gold Toe.  The price was excellent and my son likes them very much.  (He's very finicky about some things and it was a real "if" to try something new)... I'm so happy that Amazon offered them and at a price that meant it would not be a huge loss if they didn't work out.  My son has looked at the price of this sock at some of the department stores nearby & discovered that the Amazon price is very good; so now we know where to go when he needs some more.  Thank you, Amazon	1
B00064VJP0:bargain_leather_bag:p._carlson	So far I have been very satisfied with this bag. For the price I really can't complain. It has enough different sections, places for pens, a divider, pouches in front and other nice touches that makes it a pleasure to use.	1
B0002PD2HG:i'm_used_to_walmart_clearance_rack_stuff....:p._horbatt_"phorbatt"	It's only been the last 7 years or so that I've enjoyed wearing a robe around the house, I admit I used to be walking around in my underwear when I woke up in the morning!  All of my previous robes were typically off the clearance racks, and mostly some kind of inexpensive terrycloth.	1
B0002TW2DW:socks_that_stay_up:d._warkentin	My husband really likes these socks because they do not slide down his legs below the tops of his work boots.  I also like the fact you can buy them in black and Amazon had a fantastic price on them.  I don't know the wearability of the socks since I just got them for my husband for Christmas.  I bought these same socks in white locally some time ago and they seem to be wearing okay - no holes in the toes, yet!  Overall, I think the socks are great.	1
B000JH0W6Q:travalon_luggage_scale:v._allwardt_"shopper"	This little scale can pay for itself many times over, and grants peace of mind as you approach check in.  I purchased two, one for my Australian friend who always overpacks and has to pay at the gate for overweight luggage.  It is more accurate than bathroom scales.  If you are by yourself, hold it in front of a mirror.	1

B000AI7V9U:perfect_size_for_canon_powershot_s2_is:s._meads	I purchased 2 other bags before finding this one.  It is awesome.  The Canon S2 IS is a hard camera to find a case for that isn't way too tight or super big.  I wanted a bag for my camera and the original accessories that came with it.  This bag fits it all perfectly!!  It isn't too small or too big.  The camera fits perfectly without squishing it in the main compartment and has a little bit of room left for the usb cord or whatever else you want to put in there.  I wouldn't recomend this bag if you are looking for a bag to hold additional lenses is, it isn't big enough for that	1
B000IBKZE2:great_boot:stuart_c._harris	Bought this boot for varying terrain and temperature conditions.  It is stable, comfortable, provides good traction, and is warm without being sweaty. I would strongly recommend this boot.	1
B000H0WNX0:dressed-up,_feminine_courduroy_shirt:target_shopper	This shirt is a dressier than the usual shirt jacket or big shirt.  It is unlined, has a bit of stretch for comfort, and is just slightly fitted to prevent that big blob shapelessness of some other courduroy shirts. I think it runs true to size and matches the color on-screen. I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes the comfort of big shirts in the winter, and maybe she can have that comfort even at work with this shirt. It was almost thirteen dollars then, but I have seen it for less than ten which would be a really good deal	1
B0002V2ZDM:best_trouser_socks_for_plus_size_women:laura_chase_"laura_chase"	I purchased these socks from a large department store in Chicago and fell in love with them and wanted to get rid of every other pair of trouser socks I had. It took me months of online searching through all major department stores to find them and then as a last resort I went to Amazon and found them in a second. I have already bought 8 pairs and will probably order another dozen and get rid of all the poorly made and uncomfortable socks I have in my drawer. I am hooked on Hue Plus size and it is so easy through Amazon.	1
B0002OQGAC:i_would_highly_recommed_these...very_nice!:jan_"janca"	I was concerned that these silk PJ's would be really thin and on the cheap side. But to my surprise, they are much thicker then I thought they would be and feel like they will hold up rather well.	1
B000GZ6VIE:great_buy:linda_christie_"omahawriter"	I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items I ordered -- as well as receiving a 10% discount coupon for my next order. Thanks	1

B0007IQF8G:you_can_have_it_all..:dough_ray__me_"savvy_shopper"	So glad I didn't have to choose between the convenience of carrying all my cards and the bulkyness of a holder big enough to accommodate them. This wallet is slimline and holds all my cards.	1

B000ANQXDU:nice_tote:nymoviegirl_"nymoviegirl"	I am happy with this bag (I got the pink and white one). It is a lovely color, nice size, durable and good price. It comes with an outside pocket and I received it quickly. My only complaint is that almost $7 in shipping is being charged for a light tote that was $3.99, otherwise I highly recommend this bag.	1
B000HARD58:cute:marietta	I love these shoes and they are so cute and comfortable.  The heel is not so tall that you feel like you can't walk.  Customer service and shipping was excellent.  Best price I could find.  Don't hesitate on this purchase.  You'll love them	1
B00074USK6:good_purchase:d._mcbride_"hd4dmtn"	These are great goggles they are as good as sweeds but don't leave marks.  they stick to your head the same way.  I have used mine in several Triathlons and they are so easy to use and adjust if needed.	1
B000CH8PH6:never_buy_just_one:tracie_hall_"star_spotter"	I made a bone head move and just bought one. It cost as much to send it as it did for one shirt. These people have areally good t-shirts. Not thin, and they are stiched well	1
B000KBNDGW:wellies_par_excellence:diva_designed	These Wellies (rubber boots) are a show-stopper! I get lots of comments on how smashing they look - and they are very functional - I wear them in the garden, on the beach (can walk into pretty high water without getting wet) and they are comfortable for long periods of walking.	1
B000KI1768:nice_dress_bag:sheri_jones_"sher"	This is really too small for me to use everyday but is great for times when I want something dressy.   It is a very pretty little bag.	1

B0002JTUT6:woodland_camo_vintage_paratrooper_fatigues:wendy_eckert	The fatigues were just what my son wanted.  The only thing wrong was that there was no inseam available to order.  I guess on fatigues you are suppose to use the drawstring at the bottom.  But my son didn't want that so I had to hem about four inches on each leg.  Other than that it was an excellent product	1
B000FULA7M:looks_awesome!:greenisthebest	I bought these boots when they were on sale. Definitely worths the money! they look great with skinny jeans tucked in, and they are really comfortable. Whoever saw my boots loved them	1
B000EDI64K:great_shirt:j._bordbar	Shirt looks good, its a tighter fit not lose. Color is very dark and looks almost black in some angles	1
B000J5AHAO:i_love_them_but...:evangeline_"van"	For me, they are very difficult to put on.  I have to use a long shoe horn. They aren't tight, in fact they are so wonderfully comfortable and warm. They look great if you like the UGG look.  I'm hoping when they loosen up, they will be easier to put on.  The top scrunches down when I put my foot in that is why it is so hard to get them on. It could be me though!Otherwise, I love everything else about them.	1
B000LJF9JC:it's_pretty_good:i._nguyen	The skin fits well & the belt clip works well. It seems a bit bulkier than my friend's Zen skin & belt clip...but she paid about $10 more than I did! I would definitely recommend this product. I have yet to use the armband so I can't review that right now.	1
B000E9UEF8:comfy:kathy-ann_best_"k.best"	My son love these shoes, I have to stop him from wearing them so much, I just wish they came in other colour	1
B0009K5UJW:righteous_bra:wild_animals	I got this bra at a deeply discounted price when it was on clearance at a nearby store, and I didn't realize how much I liked it until I decided to buy another one some time later, and panicked when I couldn't make out the writing on the tag.  I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.	1
B000F9YLFQ:light_weight_nice_style:p._eberl_"nan_of_4"	These shoes not only look great but feel wonderful. They are so light weight and comfortable. Great product at a great price	1

B000GEZWJY:fantastic_value:l2	These sweaters are a fantastic value for $18.  Quality is excellent, though the colored trim may not appeal to all tastes.  Note that the fabric is somewhat thicker than most merino wool sweaters and the sizing on this model is a little snugger than the other Raffi merino sweaters	1

B000085HYH:best_small_wallet_:steven_larsen	This is the best of the small front pocket wallets available.  Other front pocket wallets have gimmicky designs that don't work well.  This is designed on the same pattern as a full size wallet, only reduced to 4x3 inches.  Holds three cards, bills, and ID as well as having a little room under the ID card for business cards.  Great buy	1

B000GW54VM:faux_fur_leopard_belt_with_silver_tone_buckle:joan_tsamas_"bonbonjoan"	This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's longer and perfect for wearing on your hips.  Feels nice and soft and belt is not stiff	1
B0000UR3GY:superb_shoe_for_running_or_day_to_day_use:darrin_johnson	The New Balance 991 GL (and 991 and 990 before it) is an outstanding shoe for running and day to day use (even some cross training). I have worn this family of shoes because they provide ample support, wear well and are well ventilated. The 991 GL carries on that tradition. Hopefully, the 992 will be just as good	1
B000AOJM8W:great_shoes!:brett_ashley_"mommabear"	The Moondoggies are very comfy and cute as can be! Perfect for wearing to the park with the kids but nice enough to veture out in the evening... I am buying another pair.	1
B00030NOEQ:i_love_bowling!:j._kidd_"a_fan_of_many_things"	I was so impressed with this shirt that I had to buy another for my best friend!  It is for her birthday, so I have yet to see her expression!  But since I thought it was awesome, I knew she would love it too.  We are both on different bowling leagues and so far, everyone else got a kick out of it.  My opinion, this is where we should get a good team together and order from CruisinUSA.  I wouldn't mind being a Gutter Gal, so to speak!  These shirts are AWESOME!  I give BowlingShirts.com 10 stars!!  Bravo!	1
B000FXYOWM:style_and_comfort_for_a_steal!!!:lady_dulce	I couldnt resist these shoes for the price...I've had good experience with Bandolino branded shoes.  I have two other pairs that are stylish and very comfortable.  Sure enough, this pair of boots are very comfortable too!  The color is a great burnished bronze, that is a great neutral color to wear (plus metallics are in fashion again).  The zip-up is easy, and the calf is roomy.  I'm very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone who doesn't want to spend 100's of dollars, but wants to get the look and comfort of expensive shoes	1

B000689D4U:nice_shoes,_but_very_small:s._rogers	These were nice, lightweight budget jazz shoes; however, they do NOT fit the same as street shoes, despite what the description says. My daughter wears a 2.5 in street shoes, and I ordered her a 4 in the jazz bootie thinking there would be plenty of room for growth. WRONG!

B000IELJNA:great_product:lisa_mcghee	I love this umbrella. It's just the right size and works perfectly. It's so pretty that I don't want to get it wet!!	1
B000E1VHBQ:to_nice_to_live_for!!!!!!!:pc_klue_"742617000027"	Now this Military Style Combat Boot is one of a kind! It takes a while to break it in but after, you will enjoy it! It looks so cool just looking at it, never mind wearing it! its leather is tops! And it WILL last a life time! Not water proof, but great for jungle trekking! Shines easy	1
B000FSAGWY:awesome_boots!:a._garcia	Just got them in the mail today. As other kenneth cole reaction shoes, it runs one size larger. I'm usually a 12 but I ordered an 11 and they fit just right. These boots look great with jeans. The color is a bit darker than the one shown in the photograph.	1
B000JDGCW8:the_best_shoes:a._anderfuren_"journalist_turned_stay_at_home_mom"	robeez are the only brand of shoes we even bother to use. they are well made and do not come off by accident or when baby tries to get them off! we've tried all of the other generic brands and they all come off, but not these. its worth it to spend the extra $$ on these shoes. and they're so well made they'll last for baby #2	1
B0000C2M1Y:like_the_waste_band:justmyluckfor2_"buster"	I GOT THESE CAUSE I AM PREGNANT AND TRYING TO FIND CLOTHS THAT FIT IS KINDA HARD BUT WITH THESE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM BECAUSE IT HAS ADJUSTABLE SNAPS FOR THE WAST	1
B000AZCI1Y:delivery_time_and_price_fantastic:anastasia_"gadgetqueen"	This is the only shoe I wear for High Impact Jazzercise classes four+ times per week.  I have a wide, flat foot and this shoes fit me perfectly.  And with boot cut jazz pants, they look great!	1
B000KKWSJ6:best_running_shoes_ever!:tessa_d	I absolutely love these shoes.  I have a very high arch and I am a hard heel-striker.  Needless to say that finding a comfortable shoe for my difficult feet has been a real chore.  These shoes have plenty of cushion in the heel and yet also support my arches.  However, I did put an extra arch support insert in (did I mention I have really high arches?) but didn't get the usual "crowding" effect which was wonderful. I've bought lots of shoes that were supposed to be right for my type of foot but after running in them had to eventually give them away.  These shoes were honestly perfect right out of the box, I've been walking/jogging/running in these babies for over a month now with no problems whatsoever. I plan on buying several pairs of these before somebody decides to "improve" them and changes something.  Boy do I hate it when I finally find a shoe I like and then the company decides to 'improve it' and screw up a really great shoe (bitter much? gee not me)	1
B000JGJ3YE:very_good_product:karen_m	These are very good quality slippers, comfortable & well worth the price.	1
B0008172I4:zipper_wallet_,_a_great_product__,_in_great_demand_:j._alvarez	The zipper wallet is a product with a practical idea that is long overdue . It is a known fact tha all leather wallets stretch resulting in important items such as credit cards and drivers lisence, etc. slipping out, making identity  theft a serious possibilty.	1
B000GF7CAK:beautiful_stunning_shoes:jonas_ekebom_"ioz"	These shoes are stunning, original and over-the-top beautiful. I just can't understand the review regarding the point of the shoe being too pointy?? Square-toe shoes are soooo late 90-s and these shoes are anything, but "mosquito hunters". They have a perfect narrow shape, with an interesting mix of fabrics and a PERFECT toe for the current late decade of 2000. Trust me, with 117 pairs in my exploding New York closet these have ended up at the front. I'm picking up the black ones as I'm writing this. Enjoy them....I know you as well as your better half will!	1
B000FLAAUO:soft,_but_small:shopgirlva	The PJ bottoms were soft and of good quality material. However, I ordered the extra large, and they were very small for that size.  It seemed as though the XL was more a Med/Large.  I would also think that "lounge pants" or "PJ bottoms" would be a bit bigger as you wouldn't want these types of pants too tight.  They were a gift, so I just hope they don't shrink after washing!	1
B000BK2DRC:great_value_!_:chrissie	I bought these for my husband.  He went riding in 45ish degree weather and his hands stayed warm.  He was very happy with them and I will be buying a pair for myself !	1
B0002IC1O8:sunglasses_are_great,_customer_service_even_better.:theodore_vo_"mr._t"	the only thing better than these sunglasses is the customer service i got, after i dropped and broke the lenses on these i called 80's Purple and they actually sent me out a replacement free of charge. i was blown away	1
B0007NXV5Q:comfy_halloween_cloak:midday_abcsoapfan_"midday"	At first I had my heart set on a different cloak, but when it was no longer available I decided to go with this one. I am very pleased that I was not disappointed. This cloak looks and feels beautiful. It has a nice button closure at the neck, and for those that are petite it is floor length. This cloak is just what I was looking for to add a last minute touch to my Halloween costume. It is very comfortable and soft, no itchy feel here	1
B000J4JLIO:awesome_belt:ben_pingree	This belt is seriously great.  I ordered it and it arrived 3 days later, exactly as the seller described.  I'm not sure what the previous review was all about, but my belt is great.  I love how I can use interchangeable buckles with it	1
B0002V30VI:soft_and_comfy:rhonda_janet_simmons_"rhonna"	I have been searching for the perfect ped sock, not too thick, not so thin it slides off your heel and, most importantly, COTTON.  My search is over.  This is by far the best sock ever.  Great with sneakers AND closed in shoes.	1

B000H94AL4:good_start:ike_"research_tech"	This is a well made rugged coat. Sort of a North Face/ Mountain Hardware coat for the farm/ ranch.	1
B0007G7NRU:minimzer_is_correct:a._duhaney	Minimzer is correct, I bought this bra in a 38DDD and it made me look more like a D or DD. It lifted and minim1zed my breasts. My only complaint is that the cup was rounded but the lining made a barely noticeable point. If you want your breasts to appear one or two sizes smaller then this is the bra for you.	1
B000IMFNQ6:hanky_panky_camisole:s._beaupre	Very comfortable and sexy. Hanky Panky is the standard in comfortable lace	1
B000LTCX8M:accessory_pack_for_mp3_player:vinny_c	A great bargain!  Saved 50% over buying separately.  Good quality.  Very satified	1

B000FK1ZW2:best_nursing_bra_i've_tried:c._pettis	I've been pregnant or nursing for most of the last 4 years and I've tried a LOT of different nursing bras.  I got this one several months ago and absolutely love it.  I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty "spillover" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.  Basically, this is a comfortable bra that is easy to use and will last	1
B00012WUE6:a_little_dated,_but_works_well_for_kids_and_adults.:concerned_one_"thrashfan"	Every time I wear this tie, it always strikes up a good conversation of the way things were, and when cartoons were cartoons.  Also working in a place with a lot of kids, they tend to be more at ease when they see me with this on.  I've had this tie for 3 years now, high quality, and does not stain really easy (at least for me, great quality).  Only downfall, a little dated with a 32 cent stamp.  Kids don't notice, and neither do most adults.  Worth picking up, great price	1
B000CQUV0G:excellent:m._inabnit	Let me assure anyone who is even remotely thinking of buying these shoes..........DO IT! They are not only beautiful but as high as they are, they are extremely comfortable. The detail is way more beautiful in person as they are on the website. My favorite shoe of the summer	1
B000MLB4DO:great_summer_shoes:six_months_pregnant	These were really easy for my little girl to put on herself. They were well make and very light weight. I like the ridges in the surface and hope they will help keep her feet dry and prevent the shoes from getting super stinky	1
B000LVAUQ2:a_great__shoe_-_if_you_can_find_a_pair_that_fits_you!:k._"daisy4given"	When I saw in a magazine that Croc was making a style of their shoes that was NOT UGLY, I literally went the same day to Dillard's to get a pair for myself! They are unbelievably comfortable - it feels like you're standing on clouds!	1
B000ABTOM4:gorgeous_boots!:erica_m._sinnott	These boots are GORGEOUS! I got such an awesome deal on these boots; I searched online for about an hour to find another website that has a picture of them! I'll put one up here. They're comfy, rich leather, well made. I've always wanted Frye boots	1
B0008IW908:comfortable,_stylish:casey_jones	These trunks are great.  The pouch in the front works great in keeping everything together and comfortable.  I drive alot, and these are by far the best underwear I have ever had.	1
B000GTSHLE:a_must_have_for_every_breastfeeding_mom:jennifer_suarez	This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!	1
B000B59X9S:good_quality_ear-muffs:diana_clark_"author-illustrator"	The earmuffs are very nice quality and the color was perfect for my daughter	1
B0002TRMYQ:very_comfortable_socks:elizaveta_kvint_"liza"	I use these socks for running and they are very well cushioned and comfortable. they also withstand frequent laundry without loosing quality.	1
B0002RQJ24:polyprop_longjohns:kenneth_e._george_"yankee_scout"	Tops and bottoms are very comfortable and able to keep me comfortably warm at +30F to +40F with regular Dockers and long-sleeve cotton/polyester shirt.  They are lighter and less bulky than their all-cotton longjohn cousins designed for similar temperatures.  They also dry much more quickly.	1
B0007TR9BC:after_one_month's_use:william_r._hale	I have had these boots for one month, winter in Alaska.  I have been climbing a 1,000 foot elevation trail that is about one mile long.  It is winter, the temperatures range from 5F to 25F and the trail is a mixture of ice and snow with a few knife edge ridges of ice.  I am wearing one pair of medium weight SmartWool socks and no gaters.  To date my feet are always warm and dry in these boots.  Lacing alone has prevented snow from coming into the boots.  The lateral support is excellent and better than I expected.  The fit is excellent and I have no slipping inside the boot (yeah!!!).  For my conditions the soles could be slightly more agressive, but they hold well.  My four pint instep crampons have a tendency to slightly roll to the inside...I think because of the shape of the sole at the instep (so I have ordered a set of six point that add 2 to the heel).  Light weight, but strong and sterdy so far.  Felt completely broke in right out of the box.  Not a hint of any blisters going uphill or down.  I would highly recommend them so far	1
B000EU0JMK:comfortable_and_stylish:music_groupie	i love these shoes and wear them at least 4 days a week	1
B0006JJK9C:sexy_briefs:gds_"patches"	I bought my wife the set and she loves it, everything from Figleaves has beed great	1
B000B7I17G:comfort_and_looking_good:thomas_j._wildoner_jr.	Just received a pair of these Deer Stags from my father, really, never heard of them before.  They are the most comfortable "dress" shoe I have ever worn.  Good for around the office, on the factory floor or in the field.  Slip resistant too	1
B000E77KBQ:best-made_women's_professional_clothing:charlotte_a._crouch	This jacket is well-made, stylist and goes with a range of skirts and slacks. Great addition to a professional wardrobe	1
B000HKIUSM:military_web_belt_with_brass_buckle:poobah_"poobah30"	Very pleased with all aspects of this transaction. Price, delivery and quality all excellent. Recommend seller highly	1
B0000AMSO4:great_shoe.:michael_cook_"1967_mustang"	This is the most comfortable sports shoe that I have worn and I own just about every brand made	1
B000K6QLQ6:adidas_originals_steeple_suede_running_shoe:luanne_p._oneill	Very satisfied with my purchase. The item was a Christmas present for my son and they got here in plenty of time and fit perfect. Amazon was the only place I could find the shoes in stock and the price was also lower than any other site	1
B00070PH0G:perfect_lap_swimming_suit:cj	This is my favorite for lap swims.  Reasonable modesty, but not baggy.  You'll move through the water with ease with minimum suit slippage.  If you are not looking for a tan, get this one!	1
B000FU3D8Q:excellent_fabric:guillermo_g._michel-villazon	Classic wedding tuxedo. Excellent fabric and cut. The tuxedo was changed to single breasted suit after my approval.	1
B000BP6XP0:fantastic_purchase:s._devries_"my_empire"	I bought this for my husband and am so impressed.  Nice and thick, and incredibly soft and huggable.  I have not seen anything nicer when looking in department stores. The attention to detail that went into the packaging was also a complete and welcome surprise.  Sturdy shipping box, and the inside was packaged nicely enough to present as a gift with no wrapping really required.  There was even a hand-written thank you note included.  I am more than satisfied.	1
B000CP1MQO:great_sneakers!:friedman	I pronate and the light eight material gave me breathability as well as a sturdy base for my running.  I not only trained up to 40 miles a week with these but I ran two half marathons and the NYC Marathon with this exact sneaker.  When they became worn from the wear and tear?  I bought another pair - exact one.  These sneakers lasted me half a training season PLUS the marathon.  Not ages of running but probably close to 200 miles.  I highly recommend them.  And the color is fun, too	1
B0006MHGW2:chain_necklace:laurie_a._faust_"codyf4me"	this item was a great buy,fast delivery and was given as a gift...thank	1
B000146OW8:fits!:"mabelgail"	I've been wearing this bra for years.  It just can't be matched for comfortable fit, no wires, no seams. Whatever your shape you can &quot;shake yourself&quot; into it	1
B000FS705K:funky_boots:bella	These boots are comfortable but they don't keep my feet very warm in cold weather. They have an unusual pattern that gets a lot of compliments and goes with almost every color in a wardrobe. The heel height is perfect. Also, I can tuck my jeans into the boots - an added bonus	1
B0000720HO:decent_support_for_large_breasts:l._olson	Finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating, large-breasted women is no fun, but this dress is pretty good.  What this will not give you is any kind of coverage.  If you're ok with people seeing you with Major cleavage, then this is fine.  If not, just wear it to bed--not in the hospital or, as I see some women do--out of the house.  Yikes!  I think I'd be arrested	1
B000JUDQFW:butterfly_rainboots:louise_nelson	I bought these for my granddaughter after I saw her wearing a pair of plain black rubber boots[which she loved]!When I gave her these, she absolutely loved them!They are so cute, with flowers and butterflies all over them.They run true to size, are well made,  and look so bright and cheerful on a rainy day.Needless to say, the black boots have been retired	1
B000BI3ZYY:mens_reeboks_answer_iv_dmx:cheryl_vertrees_"cheryl_vertrees"	My son loves the shoes.  They are comfortable and very stylish.  They do not show dirt like other shoes.  They look to be made well and designed very nice too	1
B000FIQF7O:great_shoes_-_great_price!:mandy	We have always bought stride rite shoes for our son, however the cost can be overwhelming when you are buying a new pair every three months! I was excited to find these here at such an awesome price. They are identical to those in the store and my son loves wearing them.	1
B0007D7R88:great_leather_bag:belinda_drok	Very good quality, nice leather, sturdy, and can be used for anything. Big enough as a book bag, great carry on, a purse...etc. I am very satisfied with my purchase....the bag is made in the states, and a great price, for a quality made item. I highly recommend this leather bag	1
B000G80CXG:nice_and_warm:wlj	Warm and soft. I have used this brand for years and they have never caused skin problems. This brand is warmer then those without the fuzzy inside	1
B000GLQ87W:championship_gear:p_mantis	The bundle can be worn on warm and chilly days to support my favorite college team and alma mater.  Material is good for both the t-shirt and hoodie.  For the quality and price, can't beat it anywhere	1
B000FDUPXE:maui_polarized:s._george	The glasses were in excellent condition, they were exactly what i expected plus more (they sent them in a glasses case which was a bonus to me.  This was an excellent seller	1

B0009JKI9K:please,_buy_these_blades!:dimasin	I bought 3 sets of these blades for my cars. They lasted 2 weeks (at the most) on average in the summer. Bosch or Anco blades usually work for 2 years. It's up to you to decide which blades to buy!	0

B000EGZ5F0:don't_get_this,_too_easy_to_slip:h._chung	This is bad, very bad.  It slips so easy that you cannot get a firm grip on the filter.  I would suggest anyone to look elsewhere and get something else that actually works.  I really regret getting this	0
B000F5DQWY:not_so_easy:c._pickren	Advertised as easy to install. Just hook up the existing horns wires and you have it......WRONG. If your existing relay is not compatible with the horn you get to purchase a new relay and rewire a whole new horn button somewhere on the vehicle. They also don't tell you it is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOTORCYCLE RELAYS. If you get past all of this it does have a great sound	0

B000BNS7Y2:large_batch_of_defective_gauges:j._stimson	I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.	0
B0002Z9QNU:don't_buy_for_a_4runner:colorado_ff	This bag was junk on a 2001 4Runner.  The poor fit made it hard to secure and even more difficult to load and unload.  I realize it isn't made for all vehicles but I purchased mine only after speaking with Lund, who confirmed the bag would work on my vehicle.  Spend the extra money and buy a hard shell unit with adjustable hardware.  Great service from Amazon, terrible service from Lund	0
B000GTHU12:local_news_did_test_on_this:chad_baley	I have not used this product. Our local news did a test on it. They found that in 2 vehicles (exactly the same) that this device only lowered the temp 1 degree. Again, I have not used it, I am just throwing the test I saw out there. Their call sign is WCPO, so look it up from there (not allowed to include link)	0
B000GTHU12:don't_waste_your_money_!!!!:j._desilva	I purchaced this product because its a great idea.  The problem is it only runs when the sun is shining on the solar panel. Also there is not enough suction to get the hot air out. Also the product does not sit on the window firmly and can fall off if you open your window.	0

B00078NJYE:incomplete_product:tanker	Appears to be a good product with one major exception. You can't even charge it for first use without getting an extension cord to plug into 110v power. Required cord must have only one plug in where as most cords today come with a plug on the end that will let you plug in more than one item. The blades on the jump starter are resessed so the extension cord must have only one place to plug anything or the fitting is to big to go into the recess. Got this as a present and so far the report is that an old type cord is hard to find.	0
B000F7WW3G:led_lighting_not_satisfactory:marie_wright	We were trying to get rid of the wires for under the cabinet lighting.  However, the LED lights were definitely NOT sufficient for this area.  We were very disappointed even after trying to double the number recommended in an area	0
B000BVP1XO:a_very_uncomfortable_car_seat_cushion:linda	This car seat cushion's foam padding is not only paper thin, but it also has what feels like circular metal inserts (I'm not kidding) placed in some of the cushion's "massaging bubbles".  This makes for an unbelievably uncomfortable car seat, as these internal metalic objects dig right into your back and spine!  I threw my "Massage Cushion" into the trash after about twenty minutes with this thing	0
B00070KA5I:dissapointed:rusty_bedsprings	A tire pressure gauge only has to do one thing well. That is to accurately measure the air pressure inside the tire. My Accugage was reading 5 PSI high when tested alongside a calibrated pressure transducer. That's why I give it only one star	0
B0007LEG2K:not_worth_it,_had_to_return_it:howard_jones_"gadget_lover"	This OBDII reader is way too simple. Doesn't really do much in diagnostic. Could not reset anything. Save up and buy a bit more better unit	0
B0007ZAJ8G:don't_even_think_about_buying_this_unit.:a._currah_"cedarpark_mom"	We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache	0
B000630AHE:worst_polish_i've_ever_used:mr._merrick_wightman_"merrick"	I think I must have got a bad batch because this polish is highly rated.  It never dried to a haze for me.  The first time i used it I thought I hadn't shaken the bottle enough.  The second time I shook the bottle - seven days later it still hasn't dried enough to buff off.

B000EJV5N8:horribly_built,_don't_buy!:t._dorau	This piece of equipment worked really well as far as juicing up the battery when it's dead, and it's really easy to charge and use. Problem is, after I had used it a couple times, the cheapo plastic clamps BOTH SNAPPED. Now they can't grip on the battery terminals. Under warranty, but so expensive to ship (shipping not covered by warranty) that it isn't worth it. Great idea, shoddy construction. ALL VECTOR have these same plastic clamps, so try to find one with metal clamps.	0

B0002JMEEE:no_good_in_the_winter.:manwithnoname	If you, like myself, live in world where there is "weather", then you'll understand why I hate this product.  You see, there are times when the temperature of my car, and everything in it, becomes amazingly cold.  We call it "winter".  You've never heard of it, you say? Well, apparently neither have the people who dreamed up this stuff.  I've had a can of this in my car for over a year now.  Went out to my car one FREEZING morning (it gets like that during the "winter" I mentioned before), and saw I had a flat!  "No problem" thinks I, "I do believe I have been carrying a solution to this very problem right here in the trunk!".  Open the trunk, pull out the "Fix a Flat" (HA!) only to find it FROZEN SOLID.  Now, what use does something like this have, whereby you keep it in your car for an emergency only to have it completely useless when you need it most!?  Cost me time + $ to put on my spare, haul it to a shop, and have my tire repaired.  This stuff was a waste of money. If you live somewhere where there's actual WEATHER, don't kid yourself with this nonsense	0
B0007LXTN2:didn't_work_at_all:scott_k._miller_"midwest_fire_guy"	This device is nothing but a high priced gimmick that looks good in advertising, but does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IT SAYS IT DOES.  The unit is hard to install, for beginners. It is too much to mess with every time you get out of your car in hot weather. If there is low sunlight, or you have the least amount of tinting on your windows, even factory shading, IT DOES NOT WORK. You must point it directly to the sun in order for it to activate the venting fan in it, and how many times is your car tipped and pointed so the unit will look directly at the sun??	0
B0007LXTN2:returned_it:robert_l._campbell	This thing does not install in seconds as suggested,it comes with goofy plastic pieces that you're supposed to put in the window with it. Who want's to fool with that everytime? It also says to not use with tinted windows, something that could have been mentioned here	0
B000JVCE6S:very_good_value:n._commissaris	Very thorough kit - seems to be a very good value for everything included. My husband really liked it	1
B0009JKI9K:fantastic:minneapolis_jon	Worth the price as my window is ALWAYS clean. Just for a comparison I leave a new but lesser quality wiper on the passenger side. The difference is incredible.	1
B0006JO0XI:charge_controller:r._gruber	The product really charges my two batteries and let me when they are getting low. Glad I brought the charger	1
B0001YLJBO:**great_carwashing_tool_-_worth_every_penny!**:j._tomaszewski	I was a bit skeptical about buying this product because of the other products I have tried that claimed to be spot-free and failed   miserably.  I was pleasantly surprised with the Mr. Clean AutoDry system!  If you follow the directions and put a bit of effort into your wash job it works very, very good!	1
B00008RW9W:this_is_the_one_to_get!:k._faber	Although I have not tried other models of the California duster, I really like this design. Since this model has dusting tassles all the way around, you simple rotate the duster after each wipe. This will ensure that the dust you capture does not build up in any one spot. This design also works well for dusting the underside of my car's spoiler.	1
B00008RW9W:bravo_for_the_super_duster:paul_everett_vinson_"dvd_collector"	The Super Duster has been very efficient in removing dust off my new 2005 Camry XLE and keeping her shiny between washes. Along with trimming car wash expenses, the full knitting minimizes twists of the wrist inherent with one-sided dusters to keep upright.	1
B0007RDVDE:great_product:guillermo_ramirez	What can I say? Mothers makes great stuff for auto care and this is one of them.  Just make sure you read the instructions and do it right.  Also, this is not going to raise any death from its grave, it the wheel is pretty busted it may just not have hope	1
B0006Q5MLK:paid_for_itself:henry_william_"henry_william"	I recently bought a pair of the reflector cover from photoblocker store on Amazon.  After I put it on my plates I have been through several red light intersections in the evenings on numerous occasions and to date I have yet to receive a fine, I believe the reflector cover has already paid for itself.	1
B00008RW9V:gets_the_dust_off_your_dashboard:joanna_daneman	The dash of my black car is anthracite gray, and it shows dust easily. The California duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax. This picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior, picking it all up in one swipe.	1
B00008RW9V:clean_interior:paul_everett_vinson_"dvd_collector"	The Dash Duster leaves the passenger compartment spotless. It is better than having strangers at the car wash wipe the interior of your car with the same soiled terry cloth towels used on other vehicles along with wiping their own sweaty faces with!	1
B0000950PW:buy_this_product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:	this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him/her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time	1
B000CFJ446:right:jerell_r._sorensen	My last 5 cars had leather seats. My new Town and Country has fabric seats. My wife insisted I get leather. The Wagen Tech IN-2248 Looks Right, Fits right, feels right. I liked it so well I bought another for my side of the T&C THE right product at the right peice	1
B000E1HAIK:reliable_.._robust_.._reasonable:sriram_k._muthukumar_"sriram"	* Reasonably priced	1
B000E1HAIK:clearing_up_some_questions/critiques:b._walker_"www.popecountybookclub.com"	Unit appears to be solidly constructed.  Maybe I lucked out and got an upgraded version, but there have been a couple of reviewers that said the the plastic clamps snapped.  The unit I have (manufactured 11/06) has ALL METAL clamps, very much nicer than many regular standard jumper cables.	1
B000BNS7Y2:great_gauge_at_a_great_price:p._wolman	I wanted a digital tire monitor becuz theyre supposed to be more accurate than the stick models. This gauge comes with instructions and is fairly easy to use. My favorite part of this gauge is the bleed valve. With other gauges, you have to put in air, then check the gauge, put in air, check it again. With this gauge, you can overinflate your tires a little bit, then bleed the air out with the valve til you reach your desired PSI.	1
B000CJ24VM:great_product:bryan_radford	Really good product, works well, placement is important and make sure you adjust the tigger leve	1
B0002YTN4I:nice_product.:j._elsis	I have a 06 Corvette and 05 Explorer and I use the ramps for both vehicles oil changes, they work well and seem safe and strong(you should always use jack stands as an additional safety measure).With the Vette, the ramps touch the front air dam but cause no damage(If you are worried about it rubbing, you could use two 1x4's in front of the ramps for additional clearance). The ramps are about 6.25 inches tall where the tire sits and there is plenty of room for me(250lbs)under the Vette. Nice product	1
B00008RW9X:no_more_piles_of_wet_towels!:sheila_scanlon	If you wash your car yourself, you should have this.  Once you have the Blade, you only need one small towel for drying edges.  The Blade does all the work for you.  It's fabulous.  My neighbor who washes his car weekly has one and I saw him use it and was amazed at how well it worked.  He said he has owned a Blade for years and gives them as gifts. Then I saw another neighbor using one. I gave them to my husband and adult sons and they love them.  My eight year old also thinks it is now fun to wash the car... THAT is priceless	1
B0009IQZH0:much_better_than_regular_towels!:tracie_a._richardson	I use Meguiar's Supreme Shine Microfiber to dry my car after I wash it. There's no lint and it gives my car an incredible shine. It's also great for windows as well. I will only use this product from now on.	1
B00008RW9U:the_original_california_62442b_car_duster:joseph_a._monohan	i already had 1 needed another	1
B00008RW9U:works_as_adverstised:g._rivet_"g_@_arabia"	I live in a desert climate and I've been using this for 5 years on my Corvette and it works great. I use it daily which allows me to avoid the carwash up to 2 weeks in a good stretch.	1
B000CD68N8:the_wagan_is_just_what_i_wanted:paul_a._mitchell_"poemsbypam"	It is a simple device, and it is easy to imagine enhancements that would improve it, yet it is as advertised and does just what I wanted it to do. It sits in a shallow cardboard box between the seats of my old Nissan where it is perfectly level and will not shift around while I'm driving, so I set it up just before I leave for work. I work close to my home, so my morning commute is about ten minutes, about the time it takes the Wagan to brew my coffee. A larger cup with a brew-through lid would make it safer for use while the car is in motion, which the manufacturer recommends against, still I am very happy with it and have no complaints.	1
B000BM8RT8:best_deal_for_the_money!:a._sanchez_"miss_sanchez"	This package arrived very quick. It arrived secure and in great condition	1
B000BM8RT8:why_there's_no_cig_lighter_adapter:catherine_harmon_"95_4runner"	This little machine is capable of pulling so much current, that it would blow most fuses for Cigarette lighters, which is why the adapter isn't included. It needs to be clipped directly to the battery, and is good at filling large truck tires in a couple minutes.	1
B0002JN26S:miracle_in_a_bottle:happykamper	This stuff is the best example I can think of, of a product that not only works but far exceeded my expectations.  As one reviewer mentioned, it will cause wintertime ice to easily flake off.  Ditto for summertime bug removal.  It repels rain so well that it is a viable alternative to doing an expensive windshield wiper mechanism repair (for those of us that drive old cars).  I work as a highway patrolman (er . . patrolperson) for a living, and quickly learned that windshield wipers tend to lift off of the windshield when when having to drive at 80-90+.  No problem with Rain-X as this is where it works best -- aided by the wind to blow your windshield clear.  MANY TIMES I have driven to a call at high speed, in blinding downpour rain, with my wipers turned off and seeing perfectly (and enjoying my coffee), while other traffic is stopped on the shoulder or crowded in under bridge overpasses (I still can't figure out the purpose of that) due to no visibility. And I find that it lasts for several weeks on a car that is not garaged.  My highest recommendation.  Three thumbs up!  Oops - make that two thumbs up	1
B000GSEQPG:great_looking_helmet:s._gentilhomme_"www.website.ws/gentils"	The helmet fits snug on my head.  No complaints about its styling. There is only one complaint.  I purchased this helmet because I heard the horror stories of people saying there helmet would fog up.  This helmet stated that it was an anti fog helmet.  Not true.  I still have to pull the shield up, or pull the helmet up.  Other than that its a great helmet	1
B00005AXI4:no_more_low_air_in_tires!:wide-awake_"$harleykidd$"	Works great.....use it on my Harley and it is a perfect tool for Father's Day	1
B00030BFJW:jumps_thru_hoops:l._burr_"ms_cooks_alot"	I've been using a Mity-Mite for three years and have never had a problem until now.  It won't charge.  I've used it to jump my Toyota Tundra (V8) and Honda Civic when the batteries were deader than rocks.  I've also jumped my riding mower, which is an accomplishment in itself since the stupid seat has to be down (on top of the battery - jumpers and all) to get it to start. Hopefully, my next Mity-Mite will work as well.  I wish it had an attachment to blow up tires	1
B00030BFJW:easy,_works_as_it's_supposed_to:b._rusk	This device has saved my old car from a non-start once, and given me peace of mind continuously since I purchased it.	1
B0009V6U3Q:works_great_no_water_spots:mr_crusher_"crusher"	After reading the review from Max I just had to let others know this product realy does work great. It also saves me time. Max's problem may be his whole process is flawed I never read the directions that may be how the product tells you to do it, however all I do is simple.	1
B0002TPVXA:soopa_doopa_item:rob_black_"rwb"	I love may cargo organizer.  Rather that have all my stuff slide around in the trunk of my car, I have it all right at my finger tips inside the organizer	1
B00009RAX7:actron_cp9135_is_software_upgradeable?:ulises_rodriguez	I just ordered this item from Amazon to be used on my 1995 Dodge Neon...	1
B00009RAX7:works_as_described:b._farnsworth	Read out my OBDII error code with a one-line description and allowed me to reset it.  No problem	1
B0002MABGE:works_great,_great_price:p._schonheinz	I installed this in my Mazda3 5 door wagon the day it arrived (which was very fast I might add).  It fit perfectly.  The height of the barrier was just low enough to fit in my wagon, so it didn't require a lot of adjusting that way.  The bars slide out on the sides to fit the width of the wagon nicely.  I've had my three Boston Terriers back there numerous times now.  No escaping possible!  I had looked through different pet stores for a barrier like this, but they were 3 times the price!  This is a great deal	1
B000BN3A4Y:cheap_life_insurance!:john_talley	After watching Myth Busters use one of these hammers during one of their tests. My father said we should buy a couple of these since we live in an area with quite a few rivers and lakes. The lifehammers appear to be very well made and I fully expect them to do their job if ever needed. The Sheriffs Office just recently pulled a body out of a local river, his jeep had gone off the road and ended up in the river, his girlfriends body was found right away, but it took several months to find his body. If they had had a lifehammer perhaps this accident would have ended better. The LifeHammer is cheap life insurance	1
B000BN3A4Y:this_is_a_must:madelyn_pearsall_"safety_nut"	Although this is one item that you never want to have to actually use, I did try it on an old piece of safety glass and it worked beautifully.  I will keep this in my car at all times, and will order the key chain hammer as well for myself and my family members	1
B000066OC7:it's_a_magic._i_ended_ordering_a_few_more_for_office_and_home:perfect_"not_always"	For those have back pain or sciatica nerve pain, you have to try this. I didn't believe this until one of my colleague let me tried it for a few days. It makes a big difference with my situation.	1
B00080QHM2:tire_pressure_gauge:timothy_c._caria	this device  works awesome.  I use it all of the time since I want to make sure I'm getting the best mileage out of my tires as possible.  I recommend to  anyone who does their own "basic" car maintenance	1
B0007RDVE8:good_product:steve_v.	Goes on easy, and wipes off super, amazinglyl easy, and gives a very nice finish.	1
B000E3CYOS:great_item_for_my_car.:gaopeng_lu_"timeracer"	It is really very nice, and my colleague would like to buy that too. They made my car looks very comfortable	1
B0002SR7TC:excellent_vac:chris_crimmins	I use this for changing the oil in my Mercedes S320.  It performs flawlessly and with minimal effort.  I look forward to using it again.	1
B00008J2DP:very_good:thomas_m._hancock	The dual grips are kind of handy - it fits securely into place	1
B000EJS9IM:black_and_decker_vec026bd_400_electromate_jumpstarter_/_inflator:jack_mccormack_"jbiker"	hi all	1
B000EJS9IM:works_as_advertised:m._h._kern	Only minor drawback is the long time it takes to fill tires with the air pump. Otherwise I'm very pleased with this product.	1
B000FW7IXK:you'll_need_to_be_a_blowhard_but_it_works:john_d._hatch	This little gizmo really does work. It seems to be pretty accurate, too, although it's tough to tell.	1
B000ET9SB4:slime:d._aniol	Perfect for my needs.  Stores well in my saddlebags.  I saw it five dollars cheaper at Auto Zone a few days after I received it but I'm still happy with the purchase	1
B000G6NU9G:size_doesn't_matter...this_guage_works_great!:d._leichtling_"dnd"	It looks funny in the ad BUT it works great and gives a clear digital number of the pressure + I liked the bright colors so they don't get out of sight.	1
B000BVB5ES:tink_visor_review:amber_r._osmon	I love my tink visor. It matches my tink seat covers and floor mats. I wish it held more cd's though, but it holds the typical amount for a visor (about 10 cd's). I'm very happy with this purchase	1
B000BQRFM4:handy_little_gadget:michael_s	A tennis ball on a string will perform the same function but this is much cooler!	1
B00026L1Q4:great_spot_free_shine:weaver_jones	I recieved the Mr. Clean Auto Dry system for fathers day. Im usually skeptical about products that are new to the market place, and one with the incredible claim that this product makes, that it will give a spot free shine without using a towel, well quite frankly I was very skeptical about this products claim. I used it today and was very impressed. It took about 10-15 minutes to dry but when it did, my beautiful silver car looked better than when I used a shamois. It was very easy and it saved me the elbow work and the 20 minutes I would have spent drying the car. I am a big fan of the auto dry system, and will never towell dry again	1
B000EBMK9O:frogs_licenseplate_frames:c._hoke_"christiansportster"	They arrived well packaged, and in perfect condition. They certainly look cute on my yellow Mazda! I would recommend more people to personalize their vehicles with license plate frames. The plastic molding seems sturdy thus far, and have held up nicely so far. Can't tell the difference between metal and plastic frames	1
b000cmgxpm:reliable_light_source_easy_to_install:dorel_petre	Easy to install and reliable. Even dropped it in the water and no problem, still working even immersed. Of course I had to dry it, but it was easy to disassemble	1
B000AMMN9O:great_product:quaker_state_"oil_changer"	I have had 2 different auto ramp systems prior to the rhino ramp 8000.  I had the same problem with both, sliding as I was trying to drive up on them with my car or truck or riding lawnmower.  This does not happen with the rhino ramp.  It stays in place and does not scoot any.  I recommend this ramp system	1
B0007N56SG:the_best_way_to_dry_your_car_fast...:rowena_wendy_lim_"anime_reviewer"	I'm not a car enthusiast, and I hate having to wash the car. But ever since we got the California Water Blade washing has been fun and fast. This baby dries the particular area of your car you swipe instantly. No fuss, no waiting time, no repetitious hand motions... just a beautiful shiny dry. A bit tricky to work in the curved areas but not impossible. It's one of the best car accessories we've ever bought	1
B0009JKI4U:nice_fitted_tree_frogs:maureen_sherry-bianco_"moejoe"	THIS JUST TOPPED OFF OUR ENTIRE SET  NOW I HAVE EVERY ITEM THAT GOES WITH THIS SET.  AMAZON IS THE ONLY PLACE I WAS ABLE TO FIND ALL THE PIECES	1
B000FEWAMM:great_product:toni_jo_beltran	This product was great and makes metal sparkle.  I will buy again	1
B00078NJYE:very_well_made:ronald_l._dossey_"ron"	THIS IS NOT A CHEAPO CHINESE PRODUCT. MADE VERY WELL. WORKS GREAT. VERY VERY GOOD PRICE	1
B00064NWVE:no_more_damage:cherie_sleyter	This product is great.  Now I no longer have to guess where to stop when parking.  With limited space in our garage I was always stopping to short and the garage door wouldn't close or to close and hitting the garbage cans.  Now I no longer have to guess.  Great bu	1
B0002MA8TE:well_worth_the_money!:christopher_j._schutz_"the_tourists"	I am a traveling songwriter and just finished a 6000+ mile tour from Nebraska to Florida with this on the top of my Subaru and I must say it was great thing to have- everything stayed bone-dry and secure but I would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure- plenty of room and solid construction- for the price it can't be beat	1
B0002MA8TE:slightly_easy_to_use:glenn_d._murphy	This carrier is very good.  Only one draw back.  The zipper only went around on two sides.  Would be much easier to load if the zipper went around the third side as well so the top open like a flap	1
B00099YORC:good_idea,_but_could_be_improved:car_buffer	The Park Smart Mats work, that is if your're a good aim.  Really these mats need to be about twice as wide.  The mats are about a foot wide and as you are pulling up to them you can not see them because the hood of your vehicle blocks your view.  Consequently,if you're not lined up perfectly you'll drive right past them.  That being said, they're still the best non-electronic item on the market for stoping your car where you want it	1
B0006GSITI:works_great:barry_lifton_"barry_l"	I received 2 multi-outlet adapters for our cars, plugged them in to each car and the adapter has a red light indicator that it has a 12 volt feed.  The items I plugged in work without problem	1
B000FH9ONC:schumacher_sc-6500a_automatic_battery_charger.:j._angell_"trail_rider"	Excellent product, and the Amazon deal (free shipping and a large price drop) made it a no brainer.  The unit is a rugged, very flexible charger from a major company in the business.  The de-sulfinization (or is it de-sulfation ?) battery conditioning feature can bring back a battery you would otherwise have to replace (I've used it successfully already), and the 65 amp boost mode can start a car with a weak battery that you would otherwise have to jump (used that too.)  I'm very satisfied with this unit, it's light years ahead of anything near the price I paid that I would find at Sears ...	1
B000IYDEOC:best_wiper_ever:a._joakimsen_"joako"	After trying every wiper from the $2 "Wally World" variety to even the most expensive Bosch wipers, I've found performance and longevity was actually about the same throughout the spectrum of windscreen wipers I was very disappointed in how long they would last (about 2-3 months of perfect wiping).	1
B000G6NU9Q:cheap_feel_but_works_well:cajun-dancer	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets	1
B0002NIM0K:i_love_it!!!!!:t._nguyen_"trudster"	I have a Nissan Sentra so I guess the steering wheel is a little bit smaller than other cars.  I had the easiest time to put it on.  It popped right on.  It doesn't slide around either.  I bought it to protect my hands from a hot steering wheel basked in the sun all day.  It's a beautiful steering wheel.  I got seat covers to match with it.  amazon has the best price.  I definitely recommend you guys to buy it.  I usually don't write reviews so this is how satisfied I am with it	1
B0002JN268:works_perfectly:n._desai_"nsd411"	You have to be very careful how you apply this product. The instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution, only then will it work. If you use too much, you will experience the "oil and water" effect the other rater stated. Otherwise, this product works very well, remember to reapply when you see the effects going away	1
B0002JMLQK:no_toolbox_should_be_without_this_kit:james_hatsis_"ahr"	Everything a mechanic needs, without having all those little bottles and cans leaking every where. The sticks allow precise application of thread sealer or anti-seize. The sticks don't leak or spill, the y don't have nozzles that clog... they are perfect. No waste!	1
B0002NIM1E:not_for_vans:samantha_wilson_"sam_i_am"	This Item is great cause its Tinkerbell but when I bought it they said it was for cars and vans it did not fit my van seat	1
B000IDYN7K:very_impressed:sheldon_botha	The life hammer is of a solid construction and one can see that it is a quality product.	1
B0000DEZK1:satisfied:frank_m._nielsen	I've used design tech products fo over 5 years and probably put at least 5 in my family cars. The only problem is there tech support isn't what it used to to be. There is one company that took over most of the remote starters and the tech help isn't as good. I tried a bulldog for my son's wife's car and the quality isn't near Design tech. I've had them in vehiciles over 5 years or more without few problems. Caution if you installing on some of todays cars you need to purchase other products to get around the security systems. You still need a key to steal the car or a professional thief. An electrical back ground is needed to install this product. They have a good color chart for wiring. Frank Nielse	1
B0007LEG2K:save_money_on_car_repair:mr._doctor	I bought this reader when my engine light came on. Turns out I could fix the problem myself with a 15 dollar part. The dealership was going to charge me over $100	1
B000G6M3V2:cheap_feel_but_works_well:cajun-dancer	it does look and certainly have a feeling of cheapness...but that aside, it works well, right on the money. easy to use, bright colors easy to find. the price is about right, no real bargain at less than 6 each. but nice as a stuffer to get the price to free shipping terms. i have 2 different models and feel the same toward each. no regrets	1
B0007ZAJ8G:my_truck_air_is_great....:brent_b._pace	I have never had a problem with it at all. I take it on Jeep trips to air 33x12.50x15s back up after dropping the pressure to make the Jeep go in the sand better.  That unit that won't go past 15 lbs pressure surely has a problem. Just last night I aired up four trailer tires to 80 lbs each. Seems like the farther you push the fitting on the valve stem, the faster it will fill the tire. I like mine a lot.	1
B000BQR100:basix_magic_shade_jumbo:tag	This windshield shade was exactly what I was looking for and has provided an easy and effected way to shade my cars windshield by blocking the sun and reducing the temperature in my car on hot days	1
B0009IQXAE:my_car_loves_this_product:jennifer_m._ryan	This is an absolutely awesome product!   I purchased a new car 5 months ago and vowed to keep it looking great.  I found out that Meguiar's makes premium car care products.	1
B000EVWDAK:good_product_great_price:cg_"cg"	This item is easy to use, the codes were easy to read and could be transferred to one's PC via the usb cable provided.  I do not have much experience with other code readers but can't imagine one easier to operate and erase faults with than this one.  For the price I could not be happier.  My only negative comment was with the PC software.  It did not allow for saving the list of codes downloaded from the reader.  In other words if I wanted to keep this info for future reference I would have to print it out.  A minor inconvenience to an otherwise great product	1
B000636OEM:not_just_for_glass_anymore...:k._hough	I have been using this cleaner since my brother worked for a car-detailer about 10 years ago and "discovered" it.  It is the BEST for glass - truly streak-free.  It is awesome on stainless steel, tile, painted wood, sealed/varnished wood, porcelain and more - I use it for everything.  I'm showing a house right now, and this stuff is perfect for keeping things sparkling with minimum effort (though you should SEE my paper towel budget - lol	1
B0009STP4U:excellent_product:jose_jorge_pineda_"music_buff"	I bought this to polish the aluminum wheels in my 85 Celica. It works so good and it is so easy to use I have been polishing lots of other stuff just for the fun of it and the results area great	1
B0007LDXLA:excellent_snow_pusher:babiche	Love it.  It's effective especially when it snows a lot.  I like that it's so lightweight, makes other snow brushes seem heavy and clumsy	1
B0007LDXLA:best_snow_removal_product_i've_tried!:j._murray	I've lived in Oregon, Colorado and now the Northeast, and seen my fair share of snow. I got one of these from a friend two winters ago, and it's the best tool for snow removal I've used. I still have my ice scraper, since this won't remove ice, but it did wonders for those overnight dumps of 18-24 inches that we got in the northeast last year. I'm buying one for some Florida friends who will be experiencing winter for the first time in the northeast this year	1
B000630AHE:great_polish_-_only_one_problem:i._saunders_"grumpy_old_pommie_b*stard"	Rated best polish in Consumer magazine and probably is one of the best - the problem is it doesn't work unless driven by a human - who's going to invent a car polish that works by itself ;-	1
B00062ZJTO:new_seat_covers_for_my_fj40:p._barber	I purchased these covers for my '77 Toyota FJ40.  They fit the truck seats and made a big difference in it's looks.  They seem to be made well and will service my purposes until I can have the seats recovered.	1
B0009JKI3G:comfy:p._hughes	very comfy and warm, my only downfall is that I could have sworn i read that two came in one set.  I ordered one thinking i was going to get two covers.  I have to order it again...darn	1
B0006GSITS:good_iten:kaidi	I like the multi-position feature of this product.  It doesn't get in the way by sticking straight out of the dash and you don't have to unplug everything to access what it's turned in front of.	1
B000BQ08QO:never_have_to_crawl_under_your_car_again_to_change_the_oil!:dmo	This product was very easy to install for the average do-it-yourselfer!  It took a little over 1/2 an hour when I was doing my oil change.  All of the needed components were in the box and the instructions were pretty clear.  I was a little skeptical at first about whether it was getting all of the oil out of the crankcase, so I pulled the drain plug on my next oil change once the pump was done just to verify.... all that was left coming out was a minor drip!  Overall a super value for the money and it sure has saved me time and kept me from having to clean up more "oil change messes".  Buy it; you'll be glad you did	1
B0007726AI:excellent_upgrade:eggman25	bought these to replace the factory blades on my mazda3.   very, very happy with these blades, the difference is unbelievable.  installed easily, look great, and get rid of water so much more effectively than the blades i replaced.	1

B0002UQATS:the_best_wax_i_have_ever_used.:detailer_al	I am a proffessional car detailer and have used many waxes through my 40 year career. Meguiar's NXT Tech is by far the best wax I have ever used. It leaves a tremendous deep shine and gloss. Keep in mind it is a wax, so it is essential for the best results to use a cleaner polish before applying the NXT. If the surface is clean you could get by with just the wax. I find that it lasts a long time in fact on one of our cars it lasted an entire year and the car sits outside. The key of course is to wash often, once a week is preferable. It leaves minimal residue which can easily be dealt with using a soft tooth brush to get out the excess wax. Every year I strip the wax off our cars and reapply polish and the wax. My 2000 still looks brand new and our other cars as well. I am sold on this product. Give it try and see for yourself. It also smells nice	1
B00068XCQU:batterytender_021-0128_plus_12v_1.25_amp:l._collier_"theworldisempty"	Best item I ever bought. No more over or under charging with a stupid trickle-charger ever!!!	1
B00068XCQU:24/_7__365_days_of_the_year:scott_andrew_cohen_"big_spender"	This unit is a workhorse for the money. I use it on my Corvette in the winter and in the summer I have my snowblower attached to the battery tender. This product is compact in size and simple to use. It came with different adapters that enabled use with different battery charging requirements.	1
B0007RDVFC:mothers_20016_fx_synwax:william_r._hatley	I was unable to locate this item at the retail stores and was lucky enough to find  the wax at you on-line store. I ordered four bottles and received within five days. I was really pleased and will order again.	1

B000EJV5N8:b&b_start-it:george_c._gadsby_"george_from_alameda"	Bought mine at WalMart (USA).  Came in a box that looked like it had not been opened. However when I arrived at the destination where the starter was necessary, (Mexico), the box was short the pieces necessary to charge the starter as well as the extra inflation devices.  WalMart was great and mailed me the missing parts.  48 hours later, after the initial charge, I was back in business.  Both clamps are metal and well built.	1

B000E3AP5I:amy_brown:ashley_a._blair_"lizardlounge21"	The Seat Covers are great......exactly what they look like in the picture and what I wanted.   I would definetly buy other things from amazon as long as they are this well pictured and the quality is amazing	1
B000EES62Q:nice!:david_e._walter	I am pleased with this frame.  No logos and has a clean stainless steel look about it.  My only issue is the bottom part of the trim is a little tall and so Oregon plates which have a registration sticker tag that goes at the bottom of the plate is hardly visible.	1
B00020BM32:works_well:david_coyle	This product works well and saved me lots of money. It is easy to use	1
B00020BM32:eagle_talon_is_a_diamond_star_product_(mitsubishi):m._koverdan	Just a comment about the Eagle Talon comment.  In order to use a product successfully one must understand the basics.  I have used this product through a friend and think it is worthy.  I was a Jeep/Eagle technician for many years. Even though it says Eagle on your vehicle it is actually a Mitsubishi Eclipse.  That is why the connector doesn't work.  At the dealership we had a whole separate set of diagnostic tools just to service these types of cars (there were others).  Also OBD1 & 2 is not necessarily meant to tap into other computer systems on your car like ABS, etc if they are not linked.  We also had different connectors and equipment for different systems	1
B000AMKUIU:easy_and_excellent!:charles_kraemer	way to easy to install! I had it installed and working in a few short minutes, if your looking for a new hoen to replace those little mortercycle type horns they put in cars these days than this is the one you want. Mind you this is not the real loud awsome toned air horns you find on big trucks but it is good enouph to scare the heck out of a moron that cuts you off :-)	1
B000IY8T0Q:bosch_icon_wipers:jeepster	I like the looks of these wipers the low profile puts them out of my line of sight. They seem to work as well as any premium wiper blade but I have not had them long enough to tell how well they will hold up. They are a little expensive for a wiper blade so I would hope they will last longer than a standard style blade. Time will tell	1
B0009A2NYM:excellent!!:budget's_gal	I can't tell you what a lifesaver this blanket is. I live in Utah where the winters here can get pretty cold. It definately makes going outside and riding in the car easier to handle. I love it so much, I'm going to give my mother this for Christmas. She suffers from bad arthritis in her legs and feet which is a bad combination when the cold hits her. One of the things she loves, is heat. Even sometimes in the summer she prefers the heat in the car. This of course is not easy from my dad since he's the complete opposite from my mother where he likes the cold. My parents often go on car trips for a few days to get away, and I can see where this may fit in because the heater from the car won't be on so much so both my parents can be comfortable.	1

B0002JN27C:if_you_drive,_you_need_this_product:n._king	I have used Rain-X for over ten years now.  I am still amazed at what it does for glass.  The spray bottles or wipes have worked best for me.  Do not apply or buff with a cloth you intend to keep as the chemicals degrade fabrics.  Cheap paper towels do just fine.  Some people complain about glare after applying it, but a good buffing or the next car wash or rain shower will take care of any places you missed.	1
B000IBM40A:not_bad_little_light:mr._aaron_becker	Does the trick for illuminating what's in my pick-up crossover bed tool box - could use a more flexible mounting system including magnetic mount & tap screw mount- batteries last long due to low power requiermen	1
B000KID31K:equus_3130_is_tops!:biz4two	The Equus 3130 is a fantastic product!  It does all I need...and at a very affordable price.  The Equus website is functional and easy to navigate.	1
B000KID31K:good_so_far:hal_a._jeffords	I bought this scanner as a Xmas gift for my dad.  He's tested it on his GM Pickup and my Mom's Pontiac.  It sync'd up with the cars and worked as advertised.	1
B0002JMEEE:great_product!:s._thai_"think_mcfly_think"	I've used this product for the last 10 years.  I keep one in my trunk at all times.  The Fix-A-Flat will work on small holes the size of nails.  Shake it hard then add it to the tire like an air hose.  The tire will inflat enough for you to drive it to a local gas station for air	1
B0002LZU7K:excellent_tool!:adam_m._collins	This multimeter is an all around good tool. It has all the features you need plus some of the features that only the more expensive ones have. Like the battery tester and backlight display. I am studying electronics right now and I find myself getting a ton more use out of it than I thought I would. It is easy to use and the instruction manual that comes with it tells you how to perform most common tests that it does with pictures to go along. There are comperable multi-meters out there that cost less but most would cost more. There are certainly better multi-meters than this one but they will cost more. The only bad things I can say about this tool is that the battery is hard to get to. You have to remove 2 screws in the back and pry it apart. Actron should have just put one of those slide off battery covers on it. Also most multi-meters come with some sort of rubber, protective sleeve, that also has a lanyard for your hand so you dont drop it. If this mult-meter had a lanyard and the battery was easier to get out, I would have given it a 5 Stars.	1
B000FJS8O6:been_said_before:troy_kochner_"raptoro"	Not to sound like a copycat, but it does what its supposed to do.  Read codes, erase codes, run low-level diagnostics.  You probably can't run a repair shop with it, but it certainly will add a level to your shadetree shop	1
B000FJS8O6:happy_with_it's_performance:william_fitchard_"facethemusic"	The unit does everything it promises. I've only used it once so far, but i'm happy with it	1
B00029X5WO:38_years_of_driving_&_i_finally_found_my_blade....:real_name&#8482;_badge_"badge&#8482;"	Really. I've used the 'premium' blades and I've used the cheapo blades. All of them have done an adequate job but none of them could keep up with the kind of thundershowers which seem to blind you on the freeway worse than the thickest fog. That is, until I put Silblades on. The first time I ran into such a rain, I realized that much of what I had previously thought was "out there" was really right on my windshield, a result of inferior blades that simply could not keep up with the amount of water landing on the windshield. Like inferior tires, all of my previous blades (and yours, I'll bet) had effectively been 'aquaplaning' over my windshield, leaving a layer of water that was all but impossible to see through. It took Silbades to show me that a superior blade could improve the visibility through my windshield in 'blinding' rainstorms by 75% or more. For once I could see more than a blur in front of me as I drove the speed you have to in order to avoid getting rear-ended by other blinded drivers.	1

B0002U2V1Y:unbelievable_product:_mother's_california_gold_clay_bar_:bob_i.	I first bought the Mother's Clay Bar system a year ago.  It sat on the shelf until I tried it on my two year old Honda CR-V.	1

140738	We live in a 1.5 story home where the master is the only thing upstairs & my husband runs an ISP from home - LOTS of computers in the house, so we had to find a good monitor that would drown out the static of the electronics & outside world, but allow us to hear our little pip-squeek clearly.	0
264134	Leaking, slipping, can't use over the kitchen sink. Horrible Design.	0
285964	I am just writing to say that I LOVED this tub until my baby was 2 months, and at 26 inches tall her head was hanging over the edge and we could no longer easily shampoo and rinse without getting water everywhere.  Also, the edge is rounded so that any water splashed on it goes right out...wet Mommy and Daddy!  So it was great until she reached 10 lbs and could not use the hammock anymore and maybe we'll use it when she can sit up, but I'm thinking we'll just use the big tub when she can sit up!	0
360742	We have had nothing but problems with the receiver.  We have it in our kitchen and it's no more than 30 feet from our son's bedroom.  Any time we walk near the receiver it beeps from loss of signal.  The beep is very annoying because it won't stop until you move out of the way.  If we open the fridge door it beeps also.  We've tried all the frequency combinations with no luck.  It is also very subsceptible to interference and makes loud crackling sounds, even at low volume, until you change the frequency.	0
396049	We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day!	0
515399	I wore the baby plus with my first pregnancy.  I will say our child is a bright, out-going 8 month old now, but in the beginning she WAS colicky and a terrible napper! I thought this was a brilliant idea, but began to realize that many of the bright, gifted children I know didn't have exposure to this system.   It is loud to wear and not so comfortable.  You are instructed to wear it an hour at a time and can be quite maddening. Good luck if you choose to purchase, but just think, einstein was fine with out one	0
546575	WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all.	0
592250	I bought this chair because of the great reviews, I hesitated at spending so much, but figured that all the features would be worth it considering my son would be using it for a couple of years.	0
B00007GVNM:extremelydisappointed:allison_i._marcoz	I usually love The First Years products.  I already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it.  I wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so I thought I'd try this one.  I was expecting to love the swing feature, it was the one thing I thought was missing out on the fisher price one.  Well, I returned this chair w/in 24 hours and bought a second fisher price one.  Here are the reasons why; The base of the chair is hollow and wobbly, it is also very wide and didn't comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair.  You have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide.  At their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure.  Thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out, and then you wipe baby's hands, as you're putting your hands under his pits to lift him off, he's already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray.  The back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down.  You have to take the chair apart to adjust the level.  And when folded up, it's not as compact and portable as fisher price's model.  Do yourself a favor and splurge the extra $5 for the healthy care booster seat.	0
B0006FHB6A:not_well_thought_out:avid_shopper	I bought this for my 4month old for Christmas, I liked the pretty, bright colors and the sounds the foot pad would make.. she was a little small when I put her in, but nothing a thin blanket tucked around her for support wouldn't fix, and a pillow under her feet.  She wasn't heavy enough yet to push the foot pad to make noise, all of those things she would grow into though.  The part I couldn't over look though is how close all the toys were to her head and how hard the toys were.  She tried to chew on the see-saw (teething, everything goes to the mouth) and it was too hard and hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back and bumped it on the mirror behind her.  It was a pitiful sight. Poor baby. I don't know why they didn't allow just a little more tray space  and curved that silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads.  I think a little more thought put into the product and it could be a great toy, but as it is now I think it's just a little too "rough around the edges".  I took mine back to the store and then bought an Evenflo, she fits in it much better and so far she LOVES it.	0
B00067TA2Q:poor_durability:phyllis_purcell	We received this mattress as a babyshower gift 4 years ago (I was registered at Babies R Us).  My first child used it for a little over 2 years.  My second child has used it for nearly 2 years.  Neither child is big (in fact, one is rather petite). Even though the mattress was not abused, it cracked and ripped in numerous places.  I'm currently researching the 'lifetime warranty' policies from Kolkraft.  I don't recommend this mattress.	0
B000B74DYQ:can't_see_how_the_mfr_thought_this_was_worthy_of_release:adam_scoville	After a concerted effort to get this monitor to work acceptably, I returned it. This is one of the few products I've had that truly made me ask, "What were they thinking?" The monitor gives off a loud "out of range" beep whenever it's not in good communication, and there's no way to shut it off. Compound that with the fact that it will intermittently think it's out of range even when it's just in the next room, and it is completely unusable when parents are trying to sleep. But that's the least of it. The voice-activated mic clicks loudly in and out when it decides to transmit, or not. This is annoying, but all the moreso because when it decides to transmit seems to have absolutely no correlation to when there is actually sound in the room. And finally, the transmission is absolutely unintelligible: it's marred by a lot of what sounds like digital compression artifacts that garble the sound--speech absolutely cannot be understood over this monitor. In short, in no respect is this a functional product	0
B00005BT1B:bravado_bras_are_better:first_time_mother	I agree with Rebecca -- Bravados are more simple, more flexible, and more comfortable	0
B00005TZJJ:averge_products,_poor_casing:e_tevis_"aka_-_sibyl"	This was given to me as a gift, and although I have used it, it would not be my first choice in infant care.  The nail clippers are mediocre at best, I understand they shouldn't be sharp for an infant but I have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son's nails.  The syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn't pull a hair out of my head - they have absolutely no grip.  I have never used the brush, comb or toothbrush (I have others) but they do make for good entertainment when diapering!  The case is cumbersome and of poor design.  Everytime I open it - everything falls out!	0
B0009RG8R8:shipping_issues....:joycew7_"joycew7"	I will never order an item like this again as it came destroyed! They need to repackage items like this for shipping. It it the second and the last item of this type I will order online. The other was a bassinet and it also arrived broken with the box destroyed. I have complained before but never get a response...too bad too as I like Amazon	0
B00003ZACK:good_in_theory:"fcwalsh"	This is one of those products that is good in theory but not in practice.  I thought, "OOh what a nifty idea, a head bumper!" The whole idea was great; BUT if your baby is a wiggle worm like mine, then the head bumper guard is a waste.  I actually found this item to be more of a hazard than anything.  Because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up with his arm stuck under the side guards wrapped in a semicircle around the bumpers.  Don't ask me how he did this.  The good thing was that if he wet through his diaper the pad underneath absorbed the urine.  Other than that it was a hassle to keep in the crib	0
B000JOOGK2:where_is_the_key_that's_in_the_photo?:k._glann	Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy	0
B000BK8OV6:do_not_bother_with_this:j._d._covington_"jc"	I bought two for my kids' seats.  They constantly bunch up and slip around.  Now I have to lose money in shipping to send them back for a refund.	0
B0000E0JDV:broke_within_weeks:joanna_purgason	We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept	0
B000056HKN:these_are_some_really_cheap_sheets...:mimi's_mommy_"live_love_laugh..."	I don't have an abundance of money, but I would definitely pay double if the quality of the sheets was better. I don't even want to know what the thread count is on these sheets... From what I understand, these are the only sheets that fit the thing, so I guess I'm just out of luck. Hope to see an alternative to these sheets real soon.	0

B0002K9H6G:absolutely_not_recommended:nytriplets	We should have been much more careful and read other customers' negative reviews on this crib mattress pad before purchasing three of them (eventually cancelled one).  We would not recommend this item.	0
B0000A340I:poorly_constructed:chunka_"chunka"	Tried this and the zippering was poorly constructed. Ihave a product from Nano Bags that beats this one in construction and comfort.  This was nice only received as a gift but nothing more.	0
B00006ZCCE:not_worth_it_for_us:sarah_l._hanawald_"mom_of_twin_girls"	I just logged in to see this item's price so that I could price ours for the consignment sale.  Neither of my girls was crazy about tummy time, and this didn't help that at all.	0
B0001D12XA:way_too_difficult_to_be_portable_and_poor_sleeping_surface:s._reyes	I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble.  The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its "travel bag."  The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps.  I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way.  I recommend you avoid this product!	0
B000056JEG:absolute_mess:mami	If you are looking to make a mess, lose milk and get frustrated, these are the bags for you.  First, these bags do no stand up on there own and it is very inconveniant to carry a little cup around to help fill the bag. You have to string the twist-tie into each bag by yourself.  Also you are supposed to tear the little tab on the bottom of the bag to get the milk out.  It's not that easy.  The first time I did it I lost a whole bunch of milk.  Your better off untwisting the tie and pouring it from there.  The worst thing about the bag is that they have leaked a few times that my caregiver was warming up the milk.  This never happened with the other bags on the market.  My favorite is lansinoh.  Another bag thing about these Medela bags are that they are more expensive than the others.  Pass on this and try others	0
B000056JEG:terrible_storage_bags:j._roell	I love my Medela Pump In Style but their breastmilk storage bags are awful.  The twist-tie closure is complicated.  They also spill milk easily when pouring into a bottle after thawing.  I recommend the Lansinoh bags.  They have an easy-to-use double zip closure to ensure that the milk will stay fresh and it's very easy to get the air out of the bag before closing.  You can also lay them flat to freeze so they won't take up much space in the freezer.  They pour great - no spills!	0
B000056HMD:best_diaper_you_can_buy_in_a_store:sandra_"peanutbutter"	I started using these for cloth diapering with my first child.  They hold plenty and have held up pretty well.  the ones I havn't bleeched are still going strong after 6 years!  These aren't as great as Chinese Prefolds but then again they are a little bit cheaper, trimmer and you can get them when you need them rather than having to wait a week for them to arrive in the mail.  these are the best diapers sold in stores	0
B000325T8S:did_not_like_this_swing:c_slovak_"mom_of_three_boyz"	I tried Fisher-Price's Take-Along Jungle Swing then this Open Travel Swing. In both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat. The Jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn't stay closed well and the "palm tree" was always in the way. Finally I bought the Fisher-Price Aquarium Swing. I found the seat of the Aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place (so it won't fold over on baby) and it is easier to assemble and haul around.	0
B00007C65S:will_wake_your_baby_up_when_it's_done:venugopal_balasubramonian	The warmer made such a loud beep when it completed its task that it woke our baby up. So much so that we ended up staying near it to shut it off before it went beeping! Had to also physically pull out the power cord after each use as it had no auto shut off.	0
B000056JB8:i'm_sorry........................i_hate_it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:c._lipscomb_"aloha_haven"	I have looked at alot of other reviews before I bought and wished that I hadn't because. You can't go off someone else's experience, you REALLY have to experience it for yourself. First of all it's too bulky. The suction thing on the tub didn't stick and it was in the way when I tried to shower and kept falling down. My poor baby kept sliding because there is no non-skid at the bottom of the tub, so I had to go out and buy a small mat to put at the bottom.	0
B00067AUP2:look_for_one_piece_instead!:j._thompson	I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store.  The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover.  The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.  The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck.  I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece.  If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great	0
B00004C8SV:waste_of_money!!:jennifer	I bought this thermometer for my daughter when she was first born. It is AWFUL! It gives strange readings like 94.5 and 95.1, when in fact I know that she has a fever! I bought just a regular digital rectal thermometer at the pharmacy and it gives more accurate readings. Don't buy this, its a waste of time and $$$$$$	0
B000GE6S6A:save_your_money.:c._sanders_"mommyagain07"	I loved this at first. But after two months of daily use the thing broke. I cant get it back together. I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside	0
B0007CQ6XG:cradler_doesn't_work_for_older_kids:karen_odell-barber	My son is 8 months old.  He has outgrown his infant car seat, and is now in a larger seat, but still rear facing.  I bought the cradler to prevent his head from slumping forward when he falls asleep in the seat.  It does not help in this regard at all.  In fact, it just annoys him.  I have taken it off the car seat entirely, and I'm not using it at all.	0
B000BM8FXG:not_as_great_as_it_seams:s._dubois	I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it.  My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce	0

B0000DBHHR:frighteningly_dangerous_-_do_not_use_near_stairs!:sooty_shearwater	We have the All Clear Swing Gate (hardware-mounted, not pressure-mounted) installed at the top of our basement stairs. Earlier this evening, I opened the lock, and as the gate swung out over the stairs, the top hinge snapped off the wall and the gate tipped away under my hand.	0
B000EX3F6Y:just_horrible!!!!!:m._shah	I also had the older Diaper Champ and it broke so I got this new one, "New And Improved"! I don't know if they've ever tested this product. It's impossible to get the diaper bag out of the Diaper champ. It's big from the bottom and small from the top so when you try to get the bag out of it, it always gets stuck and if you try harder then the bag rips! It's absolutely horrible product. NEW OR SOON TO BE MOMS - DO NOT BUY THIS!!	0
B000BXHPEU:thought__this_would_work_but_it_didn't:l._olave	I bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it DOESN'T FIT AT ALL! if you are using just for home-sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don't get it for travel as it doesn't work for that	0
B0009T2CB2:unreliable:timothy_"daddy"	We went through three of these before we finally gave up.  Our poor baby was crying and we didn't know cause it stopped working in the middle of the night.  I luckily am a light sleeper.  Also the static is bad especially if you have a cell phone any where near.  We bought a cheaper,  safety first brand and have not had any problems	0
B0006512K6:can't_put_in_dryer:alexa_de_los_reyes_"new_mom"	I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product.	0
B000CBUQSS:not_the_best:k._harders	I bought this for my son thinking that the pee guard would be okay.  My son pees over the top of this, plus it being on isn't to comfortable for an adult's back and having this also makes are toilet seat loose and we have to tighten the screws often.  The whole on it is also pretty small	0
B0000AY9XY:not_worth_the_hype:kamysmom2006_"kamysmom"	I heard lots about the Avent brand while pregnant and registered for all Avent bottles.  Boy am I glad that someone gave me Soothies and Parent's Choice Anti-colic bottles too!!  The nipples are way too tough and it was a constant fight to get my daughter to drink from them.  She loves the other two brands, and I love the Parent's choice because it truly does help with her swallowing air and the tube in the middle shows when the formula is too hot.  Don't waste time or money with Avent!	0
B0009QYT3E:broken_already!:junior_milan_"junior_milan!"	My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED.	0
B0009VRPOO:where'd_the_water_go?:stacey_"dr._mom"	We loved this toy when my daughter received it for Christmas.  She loved to lay in her crib and look at it and recently even learned to turn it on by herself!  This morning I looked at the toy and noticed that the water compartment was almost empty!  The water drained out of the compartment it belongs in and back in to the part which contains the musical mechanisms and the battery connections!  It's not exactly fixable, so we will move on to another crib toy	0
B000056OVN:hard_&__thin!:tara_e._"mommy_to_cole_&_hunter"	We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time	0
B000056OUF:does_not_have_an_automatic_shut_off:atomic_leo_"amtcleo"	An OK gadget, but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well. It does not have an automatic shut off, so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil. Must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this	0
B000A32PNW:convenient_for_mom_--_uncomfortable_for_baby:g._randolph_"jinjin"	For our first baby, we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items.

B0001CJ9Y0:too_small:a._ripp	I bought this for my daughter when she was 1 year old.  I could barely zip it around b/c it is so small.  I keep checking the tags to make sure I got the right size and not the infant one.  I looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem.  It's a great product for smaller children	0
B00005V6C9:super_convenient,_but_couldn't_hold_up_to_"solid_food"_smells:emily_s._lakdawalla	I've used the Diaper Dekor since the birth of my now 7-month-old daughter and I loved it to begin with. Very easy one-hand use--step on the pedal, drop the diaper through the flap, very easy to tie off a bag when it became full. In the beginning, it handled odors well too; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems. But as soon as I started feeding solid foods, things changed. It proved completely incapable of containing the ghastly stench of those diapers. My daughter's room is at the top of our stairs, and the stench didn't just fill the room, it flowed out her door and down the stairwell, so we were treated to a powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs. I took to leaving her window open and the fan on to air out the room during the day and emptying the pail before bedtime at night in order to prevent it from stinking up the house. That lasted a week -- I just bought a new pail (a Diaper Genie 2) and I hope that works better	0
B000BK8PQA:i_hate_this_mirror...thinking_of_contacting_fisher_price:julie_hite	I bought this mirror because my son hates to ride in the car.  I thought the lights and music would distract him.  After about 1 minute of hearing this annoying lady sing, I have decided that I would really rather hear my son cry.  It is far less irritating.  The remote is completely useless because you have to press the button on the mirror in order for the remote to work.  What genius engineered that?  Also, it is to heavy and it folds in the center after being in place for about 15 minutes.  Don't waste your money!!	0
B00005BPK8:mine_broke:christiana_weisel_"lifelong_student"	I had this when my daughter was first born. It worked OK but she seemed pretty curled up in it. When she was about 2 months old we were out walking and one of the buckles snapped-- luckily I had my hand under the sling and she did not fall out or anything. I was able to return the product, but I bought the Snugli carrier instead-- I would not recommend this or any other sling that has plastic buckles.	0
B00005V6C8:several_flaws...:j._frazier_"saiwulfaz"	I've owned my Diaper Dekor Plus for just under 2 years.  At first, I thought it worked fine.  It was easy to deal with, and easy to empty.  The first liner that it came with lasted me 6 months (1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2's).	0
B0000798KZ:defective:corey_a._polen_"honest_review"	This product is nice at first but you'll find yourself time and time again replacing it just so you don't have to put anymore holes in your home.  I've bought 5 of them over 4 years.  We have an expanding family and this things keeps on breaking.  DO NOT BUY, buy something better and higher quality so that you won't have to replace in 6 months.  PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW.  IT WILL SAVE YOU	0
B0000798KZ:terrible_gate!:monica_r._pingel	This gate only worked for 8 months and the latch broke!  The company would not replace it because they only offer a 90 day warranty.  They will not even let you buy a replacement part.  They want you to buy a entire new gate.  What a rip off!  Don't buy this gate, it is a piece of trash	0
B00067IZ1S:zero_stars!!!_avoid_this_product_at_all_costs!!!!_:consumerb_"consumerb"	We received this product off of our baby registry a couple of months before our due date and never used it until a week before the delivery. It worked the first time, but never again! I repeat we used it one time and then it stopped working, it just would not turn on!!!!! I asked the retailer for store credit but it was after their return period. I then sent a email to The First Years explaining the situation and never received a reply. Lousy product!	0
B00067IZ1S:disappointing:barbara	I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working.  When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more.  I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service.  They had no problem replacing the unit.  Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once.  And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row.  To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work.  Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on.  Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated.  I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was.  I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.	0
B00081MKY0:baby_universe-_use_at_your_own_risk:m_f	I ordered this item. I have bought directly from Baby Universe before, but now I've had several problems. I ended up cancelling this order because after I inquired to Baby Universe, I was told that the item was backordered.  They didn't know when it would be available. I also ordered a JJ Cole Bundle Me Lite from them.  It arrived fairly quickly, but was slashed through by a box cutter. I've been trying to get it exchanged, but their customer service is  lacking.  I won't exchange it and am trying to just get a return done now.  I'm not so sure that I would buy from this company.  They seem to be slipping - perhaps they can't quite handle the amount of business they are getting.  Disappointing. Just got an RA number for the item, but it has to be shipped back to JJ Cole and who knows when I'll get the item shipped to me.  They don't even give you the address to ship the returned item to.  Won't let me do a return.  This is a bad way to run a business	0
B00007FRW1:too_many_detachable_pieces...poor_design_and_poor_quality_material:l._castillo_"lcast"	I need something that I can use on top of a regular dresser,  but this one I don't particularly feel safe to use because it has velcro-on sides, 6 pieces that wouldn't stay in place when the baby tries to roll on his side. Also it has a fold line in the center that is not very comfortable for babies back, cushion kinda sinks in that area. The diaper cloth cover that came with it is made of cheap looking dirty white fabric.  It looks used even when its not. Which also does not fit snugly in the pad.  The belt looks flimsy and generally useless, especially when the velcro-on sides of the pad wiggles around and unstable.  I purchased another changing pad by Childkraft. It is way better than this one,  just one solid well made piece and so much stable for over the dresser purpose	0
B0007Z2JMA:great_idea_with_a_design_flaw:kcmum	I have the Safari TT Dbl jogger from In Step and  I bought this shade because the shade on the stroller is non-existent.	0
B0000D14PW:safety_concerns:ricki_r_"safety_first_mom"	Before purchasing this item, please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats.  I purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm - but after I received it I was told by the Director of Safety Services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats.  I also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well. Instead, I returned it and purchased a Kiddopotamus, which is shearling-lined and zips but fits OVER the carseat.  The Bundle-Me item is perfect for strollers, but NOT for use with a carseat.  While I want to keep my baby warm, I think it is MUCh more important that she be safe and secure in her seat	0
B00006408K:not_very_helpful_if_you_use_cloth_diapers:l._richardson_"velouria9"	This seemed like a great idea but it doesn't work very well for cloth diaper users, like me. I use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs. However, since my cloth diapers won't fit into the diaper organizer, I'm not sure what to put there. Because of this, there is a lot of wasted space.	0
B0009T2CBC:expensive_doesn't_=_a_good_baby_monitor:goonius	$52.00 less weighted down by cash, and I was on my way with what was the most expensive non-video monitor available at the local Target. Surely being the most ridiculously expensive with all the highlighted bubbles beside features like "clear reception" and "no interference" I would be able to hear the baby's every move from every household location and beyond.	0
B000IFOOM2:didn't_work_for_us:green_mom	I bought this sling when my son was 8 months old and 19 pounds. He hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around and see the world. I hated this carrier because the rigid straps cut into my hips and shoulder every time he tried to move. The seller recommended making sure the straps were place correctly (I tried numerous positions. There isn't a place on your body where unforgiving straps are particularly comfortable) and also said to tighten the straps so the baby couldn't move around. I did all of these things and still found it very uncomfortable to wear. The seller was helpful and the product arrived promptly, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There is a $5 return charge.	0
B000BN3T0Y:not_practical_for_an_on-the-go_family:d._martin	When we first received this stroller, we loved it!  It handled well--very smooth, easy turns, could be directed with one hand.  My one complaint was that the handle was too short for someone with longer legs.  But as we started using it more and more, we found it was not very "user-friendly."  For one, the way it opened was not intuitive.  We had to push it out and forward while pulling up on levers on each side of the handle bar. Forget trying to do this while holding a baby.  Also, the canopy was too small and doesn't meet the baby carrier canopy when used as a travel system.  As a result, to keep the sun off baby, we needed an extra blanket.  These were minor inconveniences, but the real trouble started when my son outgrew the baby carrier and began riding in the stroller solo.  We quickly realized how stupidly designed the harness straps were.  They simply slid into a clip on the back support, so my active son could easily move forward and unclip the straps.  He was still held in the harness, but he was able to move about a little too freely and could easily lean over or forward to grab the wheels.  Too, after about a year and a half of daily use, the handling deteriorated.  The wheels stick when climbing hills and when turning and I constantly have to backtrack to get them realigned.	0
B000BYBWMA:poor_quality:s._dixon	I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer	0
B000034DCJ:love_it_or_hate_it!!:t._heldenbrand_"formalachi"	I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it	0
B00009NQU0:good_to_have_but_not_necessary:proud_mama	Got this for my then newborn and thought it was a life saver until she started soiling it months later and then realized it isn't all that easy to get on and off.  With 8 snap on straps, it's a hassle to move the crib away from the wall and snap on/off on a regular basis.  I realized changing the crib sheet was just easier.  With crib mattresses being vinyl covered, why do we need waterproof sheets anyway.  I just slip off her fitted sheet and wipe up any wetness off the vinyl - so simple.  Sometimes good marketing convinces us that we need useless products.  By the way, two of the straps broke off in the wash, thank God it was after I realized I didn't need this anyway	0
B00078ANK2:leak_&_expensive!:laura_kyriakopoulos	These bottle leak, they're expensive... and you can't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over!  Don't waist you're money - they're a pain to wash, too many pieces, and they just plain leak.  After 9 months of using them I'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else.  Plus, even with the top on, if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything	0
B000056HND:please_do_not_buy_-_dangerous:victoria_chernin_"loving_grandma"	My 8 1/2 mo. granddaughter got her leg stuck between the bars in the middle of the night.  I've got the correct bumper pads, etc. but babies do move.  She had bruises on her ankle and was throwing up she was so upset.  I've only had the crib 1 week, she's gotten her leg stuck 2 times.  We caught it within minutes and it frightens me to think that she could have gone longer.	0
B0000YVC5I:don't_waste_your_money.:tiffany	The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.  The nail clippers are not sharp enough to cut a newborns soft nails.  I use my own Revlon clipper especially since I am comfortable with the feel of it already.  The thermometer is sooo... slow, I get make an educated guess faster.  The case is cute and I am sure the medicine droppers are ok...haven't needed those yet.  But all in all, I threw half of this kit in the garbage	0
B000F1OF0K:suction_tabs_don't_stay:marthlene_j._dietz_"mjbmpbsab"	We bought this product so that I could see my 6 month old son from the front seat.  But everytime I put the rear view mirror on the back window it would pop off and hit my son in the face.  The blinds don't stay up either. Their suctions don't stay if there is any moisture on your windows and when you shut your car door.	0
B00005BXKM:wow,_best_baby_shower_gift.:lorraine_guest_"baby_stuff"	I brought this gift for my son and his wife; their daughter was born on 2/21/07.  when I questioned them as to why they had not used the bottle warmer, they just didn't get around to using it. I insisted they read the directions and start using it. the next day, my son stated. wow mom this is the best baby shower gift.  they could not believe how fast the bottle warmer worked. how much timed it saved them as new parents, and the milk was heated at just the right temperature each time.  my son was so thankful, that I insisted he use the product	0
B00005V9NV:make_nipples_hurt:janelle_whitney_"woahmama"	I used these pads when I first started nursing.  They did a good job of keeping me from leaking onto my clothes.  However, my nipples were incredibly sore.  When I took my baby to her first appt., the pediatrician suggested cloth pads.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Yes, they did cause me to leak through a little, but that was needed.  WHen ALL the moisture from let down is pooled up against your breast it causes sore nipples for some moms.  Don't use these.  Buy some cloth ones instead that will allow your nipples to breath (I use the Imse Vimse)	0
B00006JZV5:shredded_&_ripped_after_1_wash!:maciels	These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  I constantly have to cut the strings:-(	0
B000F1QOWM:have_an_afternoon_to_waste?:jonathan_e._murray_"blues_guy"	Some assembly is required.  I consider myself to be fairly skilled at assmebling things...  I have an engineering degree...

B00014PL9A:horrible_backpack_:rosevillemommy_"rosevillemommy"	I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old.  I ended up returning it 3 days later.  I am a petite woman (5'2") and this item was totally uncomfortable!  I still have bruises under my arms from this item.  I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual.  It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits.  I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am.  NOT WORTH THE MONE	0
B00067MVQ8:poor_engineering:maroon_tech	I unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift - did not use one with our first child.  I got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before I decided to return it.  You literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir, which slides on, has no rubber seal or other watertight implements, can leak everywhere.  Judging by the other comments, I'm glad it leaked before I had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes.	0
B00067MVQ8:wipe_cooker:mama_saint	We actually went through two of these in two weeks. The first one cooked the bottom 20+ wipes, so we returned it thinking that it was simply defective. The second one did the exact same thing! We wasted so many wipes with this warmer, since they were "cooked". We have even emailed the company and sent them pictures, but never heard back from them. Save your money	0
B00069CWB0:baby_can_not_play_with_it:r._nachmann	This toy is very cute however my 8 month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move.  It ends up moving all around and I can not see in the mirror.  The plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat.	0
B000056OV3:it_did_not_work_for_me_either!!:d._layton_"curious_mom"	Years ago when the Diaper Genie first hit the market. I was given one as a gift for my baby shower. It did not work the way I thought it would. The Genie was supposed to dispose of the diapers by sealing them so that no odor would be present. This was not the case. The smell seemed to linger in the room longer then just disposing of the diapers as normal in the trash. Also the smell that the Genie left after opening the Genie to dispose of the long tied knots of diapers was horrible. I had to clean it several times just to get the smell out. Needless to say when I had my second child and once again received one. It remained in the box and it still sits in the box after five years. I would definitely not recommend this item for new moms. Too much hassle	0
B000E9T8GO:disappointment:disappointed_mom	I bought this product for childproofing purposes.  I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that the manufacturer's instructions state not to install gate against drywall (which was not in the item description), so i cannot use it where i needed it.  Also, the unlocking mechanism is quite difficult to open and close, especially with a small child in your arms.	0
B00005BPK5:horrible:elizabeth12345	My son was 7 lbs 1 oz when he was born and 20 inches long... He wasnt the tiniest baby...

It's the WORST product ever, I am definitely NOT using it and will probably donate it to goodwill..	0
B000056HMV:didn't_last_long:nancyroo	Heed the bad reviews. I think the problem may be Medela's definition of "occasional use." I used this pump about once every other day or two for a month and a half--and apparently that is deemed more than occasional, because the pump yields very little now... about half of what it used to. So this is yet another review that leads to the same conclusion: I should have gotten a different pump	0
B00015QGKC:not_comfortable.:mandy_"mandy"	That would be one of my problems with this pump. It hurt, it took forever, I did not have a good expereince with this pump.	0
B0007OD91G:good_looking_-_but_not_functional:e._heston_"gatorerin"	I bought this chair because it got such good reviews and looks great. I was so sick of seeing fish, butterflies and primary colors all over our house - the neutral tones were a sight for sore eyes!	0
B0000ALEVA:not_very_helpful:	I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby.  Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash.  So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless.  I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in.  Don't waste your money	0
B0001BUK9O:not_the_best_maternity_support_item:suzanne_weeks_"sicilysuz"	This item is misleading because it runs VERY small.  I am a pre-pregnancy size 6 and I ordered the s/m size based on the waistline.....WRONG!  I am in my 35th week of pregnancy and this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen.  Not only does it run small, but it also fold and wrinkles anytime I move so it is not much help.  If you are shorter or petite, the waistband is VERY wide in the back and can be ill-fitting (does not conform to the curve of your spine). It is definately made for taller, longer-torso women (aka 6 ft. models). I would go with another type of support if given another chance	0
B0000A2U56:parents_please_read!!:aliyah_liles	I purchased this bed online last year.  It looks great and as we all know our daughters love Dora.  However, the bed was a disaster to put together and if your not handy, you would problably give up.  The rods that come with the bed do not stay in the holes, and for a very active 3 year old this bed will not last 3 months. &#60;br /&#62;	0
B00006966I:leaky_bottle:m._zimmer_"m-pire"	These bottles leak after a few months and it's hard to find new parts for the botttom of the bottle. You almost have to buy more bottles to get new parts when they leak.	0

B0006HBRXQ:very_dissapointed!:wendy_bunker_"bunkerwendy"	I am a previous Britax owner. I purchased the Britax Roundabout for my daughter when she was 4 months.

Since we had such a plesant experience with the roundabout we decided to stay with the Britax brand and purchase the Marathon in the Olivia print. I was very dissapointed.	0

B0001BUK9Y:worst_experience_ever:	I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone	0
B00029TCMG:i_should_have_paid_attention_to_the_reviews!:d._a._mcgee_"anxious_grandmom"	My daughter placed this crib on her registry, mainly because of  the price. She didn't want anyone spending $500.00 on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for. I found this set up at a "Depot" store and it was beautiful and sturdy, but didn't come in natural. So I went home and ordered it online. It arrived 4 days before the shower(8 days early from ETA)but it was shattered. The first 3 pieces we looked at were split, chipped & crushed. Quite a surprize considering the box wasn't in bad shape. We decided to return it and buy a more expensive model(at a local specialty store). Amazon's return policy was amazing, a click on the mouse and the next day UPS picks up. No packing labels to print, no lugging big heavy items to post office, very simple. Amazon gets 5 stars, Storkcraft - 0	0
B0001XLS84:not_made_for_a_woman:jaime_van_hoose	I was going to order this backpack but wanted to try it out first. I went to a local store with a friend and tried this thing out. The sternum strap would not even snap over my chest...I have an average build but have a chest....and it would'nt reach. My friend tried it also and had the same problem. I would suggest that if you are interested in this carrier you find one and try it on first or it could be a costly mistake	0
B0009JOTAE:fall_apart_potty:brenda_houston_"bhouston"	I got this potty for my baby shower.  I registered for it because it was Safety first and most of their products are excellent.  I set it out to introduce it to my son( he was just beginning to show interest not ready to actually start yet).  We never actually used it since the top of the seat and I mean the entire top kept falling off even with nobody sitting on it.  Even if you just moved the potty it would fall apart.	0
B0009F8RAQ:cindy's_back_must_hurt:dulcinea_del_toboso_"emarey"	When my daughter was tiny, she enjoyed being in this sling... on the one or two occasions I managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes. The cotton fabric doesn't offer much support for the baby's weight and I found it became uncomfortable very quickly. It also didn't feel as secure as some of the padded, over-the-shoulder style slings. I actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times, which defeats the purpose.	0
B00063E23M:breaking!:jeni	I loved the idea that this car seat was. Then after I bought it I have had problems with it. The handle realse has broken many times. Then the gray handle part  has came apart also. This is has not been safe at all. I went to return it and Target would not return or exchange it for me. I think it was a waste of money	0
B000CSEE3O:cute_chair,_but_doesn't_hold_up:mermaid_sullivan	I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product	0
B000JOT2RO:cute_but_not_functional:t._champlin_"naomi's_momma"	I tried my new bowls out this morning and was very disapointed. The suction won't stay down for more than a second or two on our wood table. On the kitchen counter top(formica) they stay put for longer but not long enough for a meal.	0
B000056HMB:looking_for_a_better_mouse_trap...:harry_m.	I've heard some say this is the best warmer available.  If so, parents are S.O.L. Heating is SO inconsistent. Same amount of water with the same amount of milk will produce a different temperature every single time.  Sometimes way too cold and sometimes way too hot. When the heating indicator light turns off you must be right there to pull the bottle out or it will continue to significantly warm the bottle without any water medium.  Be sure to loosen your bottles cap during heating and check to see that the travel disc is not in place.  Otherwise, the bottles (esp. Brown's) will overflow.  If that happens cleaning the inside of the warmer is a major hassle because the milk will have burned onto the heating plate. The carrier is too short for Mr. Brown 8oz. bottles or any other of similar height. The tubes provided to premeasure water are a joke. The caps are so hard to close and open you need two really strong hands and maybe multiple tools to shut or flip the tops open.  Of course, you will likely be holding your crying and squirming baby in one arm while trying to do open the cap and not spill all the water. They tried to get fancy with the shape of the tubes and cap they forgot to make them easy to use.I just can't believe that someone can't design a better "mouse trap".	0
B0002U1TRG:expensive,_but_dangerous:la_quitta_cole	I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features.  However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward.  I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking.  Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before.  I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem.  I am truly disappointed.  Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears.  I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue.  I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem.  HELP!!!	0
B0006FHBAQ:ripped_off:s._king	These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because "they had already replaced the items". Be careful when ordering from this site	0
B00069BVEE:this_pump_sucks--literally:ntech1	I bought this after renting the hospital-grade Medela Lactima.  Big difference.  The backpack is compact, sleek, and inconspicuous but the pump sucks.  It has one adjustment for speed/suction and a computer chip that selects the best combination of the two for you.  Well, after a few pumps my nipples are about to fall off.  If I lower the suction to a comfortable, reasonable level, the pump is way too fast.  If I slow the pump to mimic MY baby's speed, the suction is excruciatingly painful--and it still doesn't pump slow enough.  I am very unhappy with this and wish we'd just rented the hospital-grade for a year instead.	0
B00005BTNA:not_worth_the_money.:kelley_godbold_"kelley"	I chose this bottle system for my son after reading so many great reviews, and even bought one and ran it through the dishwasher to test for leaks...no leaks...They worked well, UNTIL recently.  My son is 4 months old and they all LEAK. Constantly. I fill one up to put it in the diaper bag and within a half hour it's empty. They aren't very durable, the plastic on the rings is actually breaking off and now I'm going through the struggle of trying to find a new bottle system that my son will take (I hate the liners)...And they never did reduce the amount of air in the bottle at all.  Do not buy these bottles unless you want to buy a completely new system in 4 months	0
B000COV1PM:not_as_good_as_other_covers:landon's_mom_"jenny"	I bought this cover thinking that anything to cover the cart would be the same.  Other covers I've seen just slip on, this one has to be tied on.  Also, it doesn't cover the entire cart.  There is an opening, that my baby's fingers always find, where he can touch the icky cart handle.  Not a great product.  Spend the extra money and buy the better one	0

B000B5A5EK:not_versatile_enough_to_be_worth_the_money:rach_"rach303"	This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib.  We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't.  As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.	0
B000056HLZ:not_needed:t._k_percy	We just learned in Parenting class (and I checked with my pediatrician) that you don't need to sterlize bottles, nipples or anything else now as long as you have a dishwasher. So save some money and don't get this!	0
B000096M5Y:buy_johnson_&_johnson:l._frett_"dissatisfied"	These breast pads are sooooo different from the Johnson & Johnson product.  They don't absorb your milk, which means it still gets all over your clothes.  The don't have adhesive, which means the pads move all over the place.  Generally, just a waste of money.  You might as well use toilet tissue :).	0

B000058DPM:not_useful_for_large-busts!!!:l._garcia_"expectant_1st_time_mommy"	I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women	0
B0002JETPQ:too_flimsy:amanda	I recently purchased this gate for an opening in my home that is 68 inches wide.

This gate is a perfect example of getting what you pay for	0

B000046S2U:not_really_odor-less,_or_child_proof:dawn_m._pixler_"dawnm"	This diaper pail is affordable and uses regular garbage bags, both of which were important to us when buying a diaper pail BEFORE the reality of dirty diapers. Even when we emptied the pail often and sprayed it with Lysol between uses, it still smelled bad every time we opened it. Sometimes the smell seeped out, so it made the whole bedroom stink.	0

B0007CQ6L8:unsafe,_unfortunately_your_options_are_limited:j._krystek_"amazon3168"	These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper.  As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level.  The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating.  They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.	0

B000BUU5IQ:piece_of_junk:b._durocher_"poohmom2em"	This is my first amazon review b/c I feel this is such junk I had to review it and epinions didnt have it listed.  Usually I can find something to do with a junky product, but this is so junky I can't do anything with it, I might as well have just washed the money down the drain.  The fabric is rough, too rough for a new baby, the hole is too big for a tiny baby to lay atop it well but a bigger baby laying on it even on the bottom of the tub as intended is unstable.  As a seat it immediately fills up with water if you even touch it, once filled it sinks.  How can it support a baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks.  You have to ring it out in order to use the plastic hanger it comes with b/c it absorbs so much water it is way to heavy for the convenient hanger, the hanger ends up bending so much the thing slips off or it looks like it is going to break.  Not easy to do with baby in hand so you have to leave it sitting in the tub while you get baby out and get a chance to go back later.  I have 4 kids and have tried a lot of tubs, seats and supports for the tub, some I disliked but none even come close to the uselessness of thi	0
B0000798L1:okay_but_not_great:a._esquilin	I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:	0
B0000798L1:ok_for_smaller_children_maybe:christine	We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food	0
B000BYCC1K:ok,_but_not_all_that_it_was_cracked_up_to_be:amanda_maishman	the monitor is ok, but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new "channel" and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby's room not on the parent unit!!! Also, we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static, broken signal (only to be reset by changing the channel) and no signal. Overall, i am very disappointed - it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly...and i am goig back to my old one	0
B0007WWZJU:worthless:crystal_s._borgman	My baby got this for Christmas.  He was about 7 months old.  Now, a couple months later, he still doesn't play with it.

B0009VRRTM:disappointed:vicki_a._peters_"vicki_peters"	Perhaps if I hadn't already had a different type of bunting, I wouldn't be so disappointed with this one. My sister loaned me her Eddie Bauer bunting when my son was born. She will be having her next baby any week now, so I had to return it to her which meant I had to buy a new one. I saw nothing but great reviews on this product, so I picked one up.	0
B000AOEWP0:hate_it!!!:p._ortiz	I received this highchair as a hand-me-down.  Looks lovely, mine is  pale blue and lime green, but is infuriating to clean.  I have never seen more cracks, crevices, screw holes, all where baby food and slobber collect. After one feeding with my hyper 7 month-old the chair is beyond filthy. You will need to buy toothpicks to get in all the crevices.  A friend of mine has a Fisher-Price high chair which is much less complicated and easier to clean.  The price is insane (glad mine was free).  I would never buy this chair even as a gift. I would advise anyone considering this chair to go with something cheaper and easier to clean. I would give it zero stars if I could	0
B0007OD8SU:awful_interference!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:j._aufrance	We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...	0
B0006BAJK4:hard_to_clean:c._lowery	I saw this and I thought it would be great. It would keep my daughter's food off of a dirty table and catch the food that she drops.  It does do those things but it is hard to clean.  It gets pretty dirty, and in the catching pouch, there are grooves that make it hard to wipe the mess out of.  I used it twice and will never use it again.  I recommend the Table Toppers- they are disposable mats that you stick to the table and throw away when you are done.  They stay in place better, and you can wrap them around the edge of the table so baby will not put mouth on table.  I use the mats with a crumb catcher bib from walmart that catches her messes better that this one did.  Her lap says clean and clean up is a lot easier.  You do not have to worry about putting the dirty mat back into your diaper bag.	0

B0001XDOYK:worst_monitor_ever:c._king_"queeenie"	Tired of hearing your baby cry?  This is the monitor for you.  You'll be lucky to hear any sounds from your baby on this thing.  Looks like Evenflo  was being literal when they named the product Whisper Connect.  You can barely hear anything at full volume.  I'm going to return it tomorrow if I can resist backing over it with our car.	0
B0001XDOYK:still_looking_for_the_right_one:christi	I thought I'd try this monitor since it was a 900Mhz and had a far range. Well, I have problems similar to Sara's. When I used the alternate channel to avoid the intermittant loss of signal and beeps, I would get horrible static when my cordless phones rang or were being used. When there was no beeping or loss of signal it's reception was clear. That's why I gave it a 2nd star. This product is going back to the store tomorrow and I will continue my quest to search for the right monitor	0
B00005QBW7:i_don't_feel_magical_when_cleaning_the_leaks_up..........:g._rivera	I am so disappointed by another Avent product that is just no good.  Short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak.  My son's cups have leaked on him, on the floor, in his diaper bag and in the car. I don't understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but 1 star.   Mom's have enough too do---running around cleaning after leaky, unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the Avent Magic Cup.	0

B000056OWT:they're_just..._okay:amanda_b_"first_time_mommy"	I purchased these monitors thinking I wouldn't need to use them at all since the baby's room is right next door.  I'm glad I did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there, so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort. Anyways, there are only 2 channels on these monitors, which is a bummer since I live in a big apartment complex.  I get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people's babies crying, which really weirded me out the first time I heard it.  I tried using a battery with it when I brought it with me to check the mail (yes the door was locked, no I am not a bad mother) and was only able to hear static.  I wish I had bought a monitor with more channels.  Note to self:  keep reciepts and packaging from now on!!	0
B000A40VXM:disappointed:ht_"ht"	I received this toy as a gift for my one year old daughter. I thought it was a wonderful toy, and so did my daughter. After playing a while with it on the floor, my daughter picked it up and started walking around the kitchen with it in her hands, and fell down, and the toy dropped on the floor. At this point the toy started to malfunction. The music would play sometimes and not others. And after being dropped to the floor a couple more times, it stopped working altogether. I think a toy designed for young children should be more durable than this toy turned out to be. Great toy ... but it didn't last long	0

I gave these bottles one star because I think it is a good concept but unfortunately didn't work for us.

B00068O22S:terrible..._they_are_pulled_off_too_easily.:jw	My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them.  Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas.	0
B000JOT4DG:eh.__not_bad-_but_not_great,_either.:e._hoffmann	I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use.  Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.	0
B000BN3LXE:dissapointed:jacquelyn_violette	I got this as a gift and registered for it for I was pregnant with my daughter. This was the biggest mistake. The canopy does not cover my daughter when she sits in it. To make it recline, is a chore. My husband has the hardest time to unfold and fold it up, not to make fun of him. he only noce thing is the cup holder comes out to make it easy to take her out. But even still it is not a good purchase and do not buy. We did however buy the peg-pergo piko full size stroller even though it is a littl but more money. Well, worth it. I would suggest that and we also have a macleran light weight stroller and that is also very good.	0

B000C40LJO:nice_idea,_but_doesn't_work:p._scoville	This sounded like a great item.  However, it has proven to be useless.  First, it won't stop a child from opening the door.  Second, when the door is opened, the guard falls out. When the door is opened the guard is supposed to block the door from being shut, thus the child can't pinch their fingers.  However, the "catch", which goes behind the door, is too small, enabling it to fall through.	0
B000GAYYCE:sounded_great!_:zeens	I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the "shelves" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.	0
B000BZ6BAM:we_can't_decide_whether_we_like_it_or_we've_been_had:andrea_voyer	We purchased this stroller for its convenience in the car and for frequent travel.

B000CRCNLU:good_concept,_poor_design:andrea_haws_"mom_and_student"	we bought this mirror because of the swivel feature - which worked a little too good.  the mirror kinda sticks out so that every time i got in the back seat to get baby out, i'd hit it and knock it out of place, so i had to readjust it all over again.  sometimes when we'd hit bumps, it would fall and become worthless. finally, my little girl's arms got long enough that she could reach it, and it ended up breaking.	0

B00029TCRQ:nothing_but_a_headache:deb_"deb"	I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.	0
B00029TCRQ:total_crap:natalie_washburn	This brand is just awful!  It's made of cheap, flimsy particle board.  It dents and dings very easily.  Most inportantly, the runners are too narrow for the wheels so the drawers fall out.  Not only is it horribly made, but it's dangerous!  DO NOT BUY!	0
B000BK8RHW:too_leaky!!!:d._wear	As a nursing mother I researched many different brands of bottles to find the easiest one for my little one to make the transition.  I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies.  I bought a starter kit and several other bottles.  I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak.  I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid.  Nothing helped.  My son was soaked everytime we tried to use them.  I switched to another brand and now we are very dry	0
B00029TCVC:beautiful,_but_broken...:cassandra_koon	I ordered this three times and each time the same piece was broken. The first two times I ordered it through walmart.com because it's cheaper, but they wouldn't replace the part. The third time I ordered it through babyage.com and was able to replace the part, but I'm still waiting on it. This is a beautiful armoire and matches my nursery set, but it's a major pain. I originally ordered it in July and to re-order and send it back three times has taken 5 months. My son is now 3 months old without an armoire or any kind of dresser	0
B00069BV8A:how_can_i_expect_her_to_sit_on_this?:is	I took this on a short trip, it proved useless. It's unstable, has a sharp edge which cuts into the baby's bottom -- I can't understand how anyone would be expected to sit on this... especially a potty-training child?	0
B0000479VK:works_for_a_little_while.:jason	This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks.  It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks.  I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke	0
B000BN7Q3U:useless:mommy_of_2_girls	Don't waste your money on this high chair.  By the time your infant can safely sit in it, they will have almost outgrown it.  You're just paying for the name brand, not the quality.  Stick w/ a Graco instead	0
B00007KUQO:no_probe_cover_refills:	I have looked EVERYWHERE and there are no probe covers to be found ANYWHERE!  Who would sell a $30 thermometer that can only be used 20 times!  This is insane.  If anyone finds them, please let me know where.  I have checked BabysRUs, USA Baby, Wal-Mart, Target, Walgreens, Snyder's Drugstores, every grocery store, every discount store, every drugstore I have been to in two states over the last 3 months.  This is crazy.  I recommend not getting it	0
B00006408L:not_very_good_at_all...:susan_"scballou"	Only the top 1/4 of the wipes are warm... if you don't refill the container continously, wipes get cold.  Plus, you might consider the ease of use with a pop-up warmer	0
B00016S2X0:not_so_great:	This product has been a disappointment. The pillow portion is good in theory only. The baby's head tends to fall off the edge more times than not! So the baby is on the sleeper and the head is hanging off the top edge to the left or the right! Wouldn't recommend, good concept, bad design	0
B0000D9SR8:returning_this_item:countrygirl	We bought this tubside seat just today and tried it out for the first time with our baby, who is 5.5 months old and just sitting up on his own.	0
B00029TCTE:cheap:	Well, they say that you get what you pay for.  That would be true if you can find this on sale for $50 of less!  If you are used to particle board furniture, this will suit you fine.  If you have higher standards, spend more and avoid this.  Some of the pieces cracked as screws went into the pre-drilled holes in the particle board.  Several pieces arrived damaged.  We had to request 3 replacement parts from the manufacturer and are still not happy with it, but now it is assembled and impossible to ship back so we are stuck with it.  If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart.  Also, the drawers are very shallow.  Don't expect to store much in this.  It did arrive promptly, but the shipper and Target would have done me a favor if they had lost it instead of delivering it	0
B000H1MRJO:didn't_work_for_us:ellen_b.	I ordered two of these cots for twin 4-year-old grandsons to use when staying at my home. I expected the cots to be fairly sturdy, perhaps along the line of a porta-crib. Instead, the frame doesn't lock in place and looks like it would bend fairly easily. The twins tried them out -- after being cautioned not to jump on them; the cots didn't look like they would holdup with a little boy rolling around on them. I returned the cots to Target	0
B0006HBRYA:buyer_beware!!!:melynda_dunn	Loved the car seat, until my Daughter was able to reach down and lift the velcro strap and release the harness portion of the straps.  I would hope that the manufacturer would address this and move the harness tightening straps under the seat.  That is my only complaint and it has indeed been a great car seat.	0
B00005BSM3:cannot_be_cleaned_thoroughly:marcie	I inherited this product from my neightbor last week.  I have attempted to wash and clean it thoroughly before using it.  I cannot get the seat apart and it is incredibly dirty and moldy inbetween the seat and the swivel part.  Other reviewers have noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried to take it apart.  I would love to try this product, but as long as it is dirty and cannot be cleaned properly, it will not be used.  What a shame...baby products should be made so that they clean up easily	0
B000BOKASC:good_for_the_first_ten_minutes...:anonymous	I bought this bag in hopes that it will make traveling with a one year old slightly easier. This bag was ok to start and fit my britax (a feat in itself) BUT 10 minutes into carrying it into the airport it BROKE. I would not buy it. I emailed the company and have yet to hear back	0
B00064MULM:not_a_stable_potty_seat:safety_mom_"safety_mom"	I was so excited to buy my son a potty seat.  He is two and has been using it since he was about 22 months.  He picked out the pooh and loved it and I love the splash guard.  Unfortunately, the seat tips when he leans over to pick up a book from a bucket on the floor.  He is not leaning over to the floor, the books are about 1 and a half feet from the floor.  This seat is quite tipsy	0
B00018XCS8:pain_to_use,_store,_and_expensive:j._peters_"huskermomma"	I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.	0
B000BDBBKY:not_for_summer_baby!:k._myers	I am returning my Roxy safe seat!  It was like eye candy when i saw it online but then it shipped to my door....The material is not breathable and my baby is dripping with persperation when i take him anywhere in the seat.  At a grocery store, the seat JUST fits into the whole cart and I have no room for groceries.  Its not worth the hastle.  I admit it looks very nice but its like lugging around a herd of cattle its so heavy.  The seat belt itself is dangerously close to the babys neck and leaves red marks on his neck almost immediately after buckling him into place.  Sorry GRACO, the idea was good but the carseat is awfull	0
B0006JKE7O:not_impressed:sushi_jane	I was very disappointed in this mirror.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I do use the mirror. I have a 2000 VW Passat with a headrest in the middle seat so I had no problem installing it. It's great to watch my little one while I drive. I do see the other reviewer's point about it being a safety issue because you kind of get obsessed with watching your baby and you should keep your eyes on the road. However, it never obstructed my view at all.	0
B000EHPL2Q:do_not_buy_this_item:anna_"anna"	It is very difficult to attach it to anything. The straps are to short and under strange angel. My son did not play with it	0
133363	We finally broke down and spent the money on the Jumperoo and were happy we did.  We have to limit the time our son spends in it because he'd jump for hours on end if we didn't limit him to 5-10 minutes a day.  The Jumperoo has sturdy construction, and the 4 settings are useful.  I was a bit concerned about the coils inside the fabric because I was afraid that our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it, but he's been fine.  He doesn't play with the toy attachment.  I think this is a much safer alternative to the jumpers that hang from the door frame	1
140734	This is the first baby monitor we've tried and we are quite happy with it.  We did a good bit of research ahead of time and chose this one because of its features and the reliability.  I like that the receiver unit can plug into the wall.  I don't really like to use the voice-activated mode but my husband does and says it works great.  When in the normal mode, I can hear little birds outside my baby's window and cars passing our house; it's quite sensitive!  I also like the lights on the receiver; you can turn the volume all the way down if you're watching a movie or something	1
193766	I got this as a gift on my baby shower & was so happy to receive it! This playpen is so wonderful, very colorful & sooo easy to  set it up. I'm pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it. I received great reviews on this gear also so don't be dissapointed to grab one like it!!! awesome playpen!!	1
243331	I purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago.  I was disappointed that I wasn't able to use it for my second pregnancy, most likely because it had been dropped too many times.  This new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it MUCH MORE user friendly.  Also, one set of batteries (4 AA) lasted for 4-1/2 weeks.  The batteries in my old one would last 5 days IF I was lucky.  My daughter just turned two in January 06 and is extremely smart, verbally advanced and a joy to be around.  By 16 months she knew all of her colors and could recite the ABC's.  By 18 months she could recognize all of the letters.  I believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of 3.  Do I credit the Baby Plus?  Who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby #2.	1
264141	Our 21-month old daughter has been using this tub since birth and we love it!  It does hold water and she can splash around and play with her toys.  The sunctions are great since they do stick pretty good to the tub.  Easy to clean and easy to put away when my husband or I need to use our regular tub	1
278403	We originally registered for this item because we have a 2-level house, and thought this would help us from trudging up and down the stairs so much.  But, since my 2-month old still "lives" in our room, in her bassinet, that part has not yet been an issue.  However, we keep this basket in our living room, fully stocked, and we don't even have to get up off the couch to change a diaper.  (Sounds lazy, but if you already have kids, you understand!)  The sides of the liner have pockets, which we use to hold hand sanitizer, diaper rash cream, a thermometer, baby brush, aspirator, baby nail clippers, lotion, a couple rattles/toys, and some chapstick and nursing pads for me.  We put the diapers, a changing pad, and a wipe holder in the "main" center part.  I also have two wrist rattles attached to either side of the handle, and my baby loves to look at them while she's getting her diaper changed.  (I put the basket next to her head so she can see one of them.)	1
301613	My 6 month old got these for Christmas.  They were among the first toys she expressed any interest in.  She loved the frog that vibrated when you pull the leg, but it broke.  I emailed Baby Einstein and asked if I could buy a replacement for the green block because it is her all time favorite.  They are sending a free replacement!  We love Baby Einstein and our daughter loves these blocks	1
349428	We waited until our daughter was [...] to get her this, and it's fantastic!  She's now [...] and it's in storage, but she was using it until she was about [...]  I like that the height is adjustable, the springs are covered, and the seat comes out easily to wash it.  (It was a poop-eroo for us too.)	1
360740	THIS MONITOR HAS THE BEST SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN PUT THE RADIO ON THE MONITOR AND LISTEN ON THE RECEVER, IT WILL SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS NEXT TO YOU. I HAD THE MONITOR FOR 2 YEAR WITH OUT PROBLEMS WITH RANGE OR INTERFERANCE. MY MONITOR IS BEEN ON AND IN THE SAME CHANNEL ALL THAT TIME. I TRY THREE OTHER MONITORS ONE OF THEM DIGITAL. THE SONY SOUND QUALITY IS UNTOUCHABLE. VERY SENSITIVE, I CAN HEAR MY BABY MOVE AT NIGHT. I HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH RANGE (I WORK OUT ON THE BASEMENT DURING HER NAP). IT HAS THE BEST VOLUME (I CAN HEAR HER OVER A LOUD TREADMILL AND MUSIC). I WAS HAPPY TO RETURN THE OTHER MONITORS TO GET THIS ONE. THE ONE PROBLEN I FOUND IS THE MONITOR AND THE RECEVER CAN NOT BE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE A HORRIBLE LOUD NOISE. TO AVOID THIS I TURN OFF THE MONITOR BEFORE GETTING CLOSE TO THE ROOM THE BABY IS SLEEPING IN. THE WATER RESISTANT FEATURE IS GREAT, I CAN PUT THE RECEVER RIGHT IN THE SHOWER AND LISTEN OR WATCH THE LIGHTS. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF!!!!!!!! YOU DON'T WANT TO GET IT WET!!!!!!, BUT THE HUMIDITY OR A LITTLE SPLASHING WON'T HURT IT	1
436382	Wow!  This is the best thing I received for my baby.  It has saved me sooo much time.  I would normally have to layer my daughter before heading out the door but I just don't need to worry with this.  I feel sorry for all the people who bought my daughter thick sweaters, and the aunt who bought her a snow suit.  We just never use them.  I can zip her into the Bundle Me and head out for a walk in the stroller.  She usually falls asleep because she finds it so cozy.  When she was smaller, we used it in the infant car seat which fit into our stroller.  It meant she was zipped in before we opened the door and unzipped when we reached our destination.  She never felt the cold!	1
515394	ok so how many people think their baby is exceptional? Well, pretty much everyone i know, and they are all right of course.  Each baby is exceptional, in their own way.  But how many babies are rated as exceptional by pediatricians, nurses and early childhood educators?  Well, I know one - MINE!  I faithfully used the babyplus system when I was pregnant.  One time when using it, he started knocking back. Yeap, i actually felt him knock back at it, in rhythm.  It only happened once, but I told my husband that i think this is going to be one special kid.  I was about 7 months pregnant then.  Well, lo and behold, after he was born people (professionals) don't stop telling us how amazing he is.  He is the most aware newborn you will ever meet.  He is 2 months old now, and has been sleeping through the night (11 hours at a time) since he was 2 weeks.  He cries when he needs something, and never cries for no reason (but i do make sure to respond quickly to his needs so i don't know how much that has to do with it.).  Yesterday he started reaching for objects.  Can't quite grab them yet, but it doesn't stop him from trying. The pediatrician and the nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he is, how aware he seems and the fact that he vocalizes to music is unheard of at this age.  He's been holding his head up since the day he was born (3 days late) and has been making eye contact since about 2 weeks.  So, i don't really know what if anything the baby plus system had to do with it.  I mean it could be just an accident but... all I can say is that I will definitely use this product with our future children.  I would pay thousands if i had to (and we are not rich people) because its worth every penny	1

B000LNN53A:great_idea:c._gunter	I received this stroller today and was pleasantly surprised. I put it together, all you have to do is attach the wheels and the canopy which took all of 5 mins, and my 3yr old jumped on the back seat and loves it.  I have the Chicco Key-Fit infant car seat and it fits just fine with the infant carrier bar in place, my baby slept in the car seat in the stroller all afternoon.  There is a nice seatbelt that goes over the infant car seat to hold it firmly in the stroller.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a bit heavy/bulky, I hope I don't have any problems getting it in and out of my van.  I can't wait to try it out at the mall	1
B00007B76C:perfect_for_a_fussy_baby:clementine_dare_"clementine"	We had a very fussy baby, and we used these, and blankets and just about anything to keep him propped up or positioned. I was forever reaching for these because of their reliable size and shape. I considered it money well spent and carefully packed it away with my newborn clothing so I could use it over with child number two	1
B00005BT1B:comfy_enough_to_sleep_in:1st_time_mom	I love this bra!  It is very comfortable, I hardly notice I have it on.  The soft stretchy material is perfect.  The closure hooks are easy to use once you use them a few times and get familiar with how to open and close them.  I am glad I bought this nursing bra and I highly recommend it	1
B000DZZC5A:love_it!!!:veronica_hernandez_"veronica_galindo"	I don't have twins, however I have an infant and a toddler and it works	1
B000CSBP18:great_starter:kristen_b._smith	Just started introducing the potty to my 19 month old and he loves to sit on it and "practice". So far so good......	1
B000JIDACS:good_for_minor_storage:dnapo	I do like this organizer, since the stroller I have doesn't have any holders on itself (for the "pusher").   There is a nice zippered area for keys to go into and stay secure and one drink holder.   I don't have any problem with this organizer at all but I put it at 4 stars because I would like to say that the majority of time that I'm out using the stroller, I'm with another adult who could also use a drink holder.  We're used to the Graco-designed strollers that DO come with 2 drink holders.  It's not the end of the world that someone holds their drink...but it would be nice if they could include another pocket for a drink.  :-	1
B000H846KK:great_distraction_for_hungry_baby:michelle_c_"baby_jack's_mommy"	This is a great toy for my baby to play with in his high chair while he's waiting for breakfast. There are lots of things to shake, spin and rattle. The suction actually works and they stay on his tray unless he pulls really hard. Also,it's very durable because he's dropped it about a hundred times on a tile floor and it hasn't broken yet! At first I wasn't crazy about the fact that the 'cow over the moon' toy doesn't play but one verse at a time with each press of the button because he was only hearing the first verse but in no time at all my baby learned that if he wanted to hear the rest of the song he needed to push the button. Now he does it on his own and hears the whole song. I think that's great. I would recommend this set to anyone.	1
B000056J4G:excellant_gate:c.harrison	There is NO way my daughter will be able to get through this gate. She is the most rambunctious little girl too. And she is only 10 months old. She is already running around and able to walk really well on her own. And she loves the stairs. This gate is perfect in front of our stairs and they're not even with the wall either. The banaster and the very top stair are totally uneven and our opening is about 7 feet wide. And with the Configure Gate and one extension, there is no way I will ever have to worry about my daughter falling down the staris or breaking our gates, which she has done due to the way the top of our stairs are. This is the only gate that I have found that works perfect for our home. Plus the door in the gate is easy to use. You don't have to squeeze hard on the handle to open it, but it's not easy enough for a 4 year old to squeeze the handle. I love that this is a heavy-duty metal gate, it won't break or fall apart on me and it was easy to install. I'm so happy that my husband and I bought this gate. It is an all around Great Investment. If you are considering buying a baby gate, you should really invest in a great baby gate. And I HIGHLY recommend this gate. And with the extensions it can fit ANYWHERE in your home or you can make it into a circle for a play yard. If you want a gate for your home, and you want one that will last and protect your child no matter how hard they are on it, get this gate	1
B0009F5B7S:this_sling_is_a_must_have_for_us!:informed_mama_"john_3:16"	These slings have been an essential part of being parents. Both my husband and I use New Native slings on a daily basis. We've been 'wearing' our daughter since day one and continue to now that she is three months. This helped me tremendously in getting to 'know' my baby. It allows me to be responsive immediately to her needs because I can read her cues before she gets to a full blown cry. It helps me accomplish tasks around the house and makes shopping/running errands easy. We do not even own the detachable infant carseats. I cannot imagine having to lug one of those things around! I feel like this had helped her transition from her womb environment to the outside world. It gives her a sense of security even in new situations. Unlike front facing carriers, she can turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated. There are endless benefits to 'wearing' your baby and I feel like this sling has made it incredibly easy for me and my husband to do so. There are no buckles or rings or fasteners, just slide it on.	1
B0009RG8E6:love:kornelia_"kornelia"	My baby loves it. by the way it is bigger than it looks on picture. I was afraid that it would be too small for my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect.	1
B000BOPJ0G:fantastic_product:melanie_sharp	This is really a great product. I ordered it for my 6 month old who has only been sitting up a few weeks. It took me a couple of minutes to get it attached to the shopping cart the first time, but once I got the hang of it it's very easy to use. It comes in two pieces; one to use a seat with the harness and a second to secure over the shopping cart handle. I haven't used the handle portion yet as my baby is so interested in looking around she hasn't tried to mouth the handle. She is quite squirmy so the harness keeps her safe and she doesn't mind it a bit. She is very comfortable and can look around and I'm not as concerned about her squirming or climbing out of the cart. I'm very happy with this product and highly recommend it.	1
B00006ZCCF:buy:b._searfoss_"moonangels"	If you are gonna breastfeed buy the a boppy pillow!!! they are awesome and easy. you can wash them, they have covers for them and they come in handy when you want to put the baby somewhere.	1
B000056J7L:great:m._womble	This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces.  It is also more stable than others we used.  We like it	1
B0000BX8MT:if_i_could_give_this_a_10+_star_rating_i_would:c._schmid	My daughter was the most happy when she was in her Halo.  I love these sleep blankets, the cotton ones for use in Florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece.  I wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits.  I recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep, your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers	1
B000M4XVDW:absolutely_in_love:all_about_the_wait...	We bought this stroller today in Honolulu at The Bike Factory. Our son is 18 months old, 48 pounds and 40 inches tall (Yes, we know we got a linebacker on our hands) so we had to find something that might last him for the next year or so.  We love that the max weight is 70 pounds, but wonder if the harness system will grow with him being that we have already let out all the slack that is there, I think??!!.  I am going to read the instructions again to see if I might have missed something.  But other than that, the stroller is very sturdy, well-made, and light weight.  It handles like a dream and I wouldn't be afraid to take it to the mall shopping because it is not any wider or more cumbersome than our old Graco.  It folds up to a nice tiny package and fits perfectly in the back our Explorer, where the Graco did not.  I can't wait to take it running down along the beach in the morning.  Oh, and our son loves it too by the way... he watched Elmo in the living room and wouldn't get out until we bribed him with a bath, so it must be pretty comfortable.  Definitely worth every dime, we love it.  I can't say enough good things about BOB either, they are very helpful and their website is pretty informative too, [...	1
B000056HKJ:great_for_small_spaces:kes4210_"city_mom"	I bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen, too small for a full-size high chair.  The seat has worked wonderfully from age 5 months to now age 21 months.  I do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but I have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he/she is ready for the next setting.  The cloth lining is very easy to remove, wash, and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean.  The tray is easy to put on, remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink.  I have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when I need the chair for entertaining others.  My daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and, now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster, enjoys having her own place at the table.  I highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort.	1
B000I2MRJC:a_great_toy:jmc_"march_mommy"	My son LOVES this toy, although I think the version we have is an older version as it is a different color. He is 10.5 months old and gets really excited when he sees this toy. A good buy and will keep them busy	1
B0001AFK1S:must_have_for_new_parents!:lara_young_"mommie_of_two"	i doubt i could have made it through the first three months without this product.  my daughter had undiagnosed acid reflux and this was recommended as a help.  (after she was diagnosed, we were given zantac... but still used this as well!)  it's a true godsend.  we'd add a dropperful to her formula and presto - she was content!!!  this works far better than mylicon.  it is expensive - but it is completely worth the price.  we called it 'liquid gold' in our house	1
B00004DSG2:multi-functional:redtilton_"redtilton"	We also used this netting last spring/summer/fall on our double stroller (limosine style) and our pack-n-play.  In addition to bugs, it keeps leaves, etc. from falling into the play pen.  My in-laws loaned us a second play-pen that was older and larger than the one's sold these days.  The netting also fit that but not as snugly	1
B000058DJH:perfect_fit...:karen_wiant	... with both the basic fence 5-piece HearthGate system and a great fit with the decor of our home.  Highly recommend the entire system.  Kare	1
B000BXKTMA:love_this_product:urainbow	I bought this product because it has two most important things I am looking for: portable and the splash guard.  My son feels very comfortable with it that he has been using this since last August when we got it.  The parts are all plastic for easy cleaning. The cushion part of the seat and the the splash guard are all one piece, unlike some other potty seat where the splash guard is an attachment.  So that's very easy to clean.  The entire potty can be disembled to be cleaned and sanitized from inside out, no hard to reach spots.  The seat is soft and contoured with oval opening which is best, unlike a lot of potty I found with a circular small opening.  The seat can be put on adult toilet seat which I started training my son after several use to avoid cleaning the bowl.  The only thing I wish is that this product comes in just the seat without the bowl, then that would be even better!	1
B000GEGTIW:good_solid_item:markhu_"d'son"	I ordered this changing pad because it has the ends curved up, and not just the sides.  This is also sometimes refered to as a "4-sided changing pad" since all 4 edges are raised.	1
B00008KWO1:must_have!!!:katiegirlsmom_"sml"	I got one of these for my baby shower I loved it so much I went back and bought another one.  Very easy to use. I just put my baby in it before she's going to sleep for the night. There is no need for blankets when using the sleepsack. Puts your mind at ease, no loose blankets in the crib!! Also, reccomend getting the thinner cotton one for the warmer nights	1
B000056J66:perfect_for_messy_toddlers!:february_mom	These placemats are perfect for a toddler who loves to dump food out and spread it out on the table, especially for when you're out in public places.  They stick onto anything and have fun things for kids to look at (my son is obsessed with anything Sesame Street - esp Elmo - so he loves staring at the placemat).  They're easy to fit into any purse, diaper bag, pocket so they're always accessible.	1
B0006IHTQE:great_buy:debra_t._hansen	We really enjoy this travel system.  Having a car seat that fits into both the base and the stroller allowed us to leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out of the car.  Being off of work for 3 months, I didn't have to feel cooped at home when I could easily take my daughter to the store or the park.  As big as the stroller is compared to umbrella strollers, we still prefer to take it, because the diaper bag and other items fit easily underneath, the seat-back folds down (allowing sleep or diaper changes), and it has THREE cupholders, 2 side pockets that can hold other items (burp cloth, bottled water, toys), and a little compartment for sunglasses or cell phone.  The basket underneath is accessible hands-free by pressing up or down on the basket with your foot.  The stroller fits in the trunk of our compact Saturn 4-door, or if necessary, in the front passenger seat (upside-down to fit in the wide wheels, which are anyway relatively easy to remove).  The loaded stroller is easy to guide with one hand, so I can push it if I happen to be carrying my daughter.  The stroller is sturdy and smooth enough to take down the street, on paved park paths, and we always use it on the packed sand at the beach (it even works over the brief path over the unpacked sand, if you go backwards).  In her car seat in the stroller, she could get complete protection from the sun and light rain with the two canopies, although I found that a draped blanket allowed for more air flow.  We took the whole system on a 10-day trip, which included a flight out of town, and I felt like our load was lighter than those we took before our daughter was born.  At 6 months, she has just outgrown the car seat (but she's basically off-the-charts in her height/weight), but we still use the stroller now that she can sit up.	1
B00009KN1D:nice_light_stroller:k._barrows	We've used this since my daughter was about 7 1/2 months old; she's now 2 1/2 and we've never had any problems with it.  This is the best stroller for quick trips to the mall, park, etc.    The sunshade is great and the built in carrying strap is a good idea too.  We've never used the rain cover, so I can't comment on that.  It doesn't have a storage basket, but I don't know many umbrella strollers that do.  For longer trips, we just take our full size Combi stroller if we need the storage or full recline option.  I would definitely recommend this stroller for a light "quick outing" stroller to keep in the car.	1
B000056JND:great_bottle:kirsten	I have used this system for 9 weeks now.  The bottle will leak if you do not tighten the ring enough or correctly - I test shake before I feed and if its wrong I unscrew and reseat the nipple.  My daughter has less gas with these bottles than with the Playtex bottles I tried.  If your child gags as one reviewer commented you need a slower nipple.  I use the standard nipples and not the adjustable flow nipples.  I have the adapter system that allows me to pump into the bottle and I like the convenience of being able to cap that bottle when done and refrigerator it until feeding time.  These bottles do well in the dishwasher and clean up easily	1
B000B4SVM4:better_than_expected.:q._stephens_"mommy_of_2"	Ok so I purchased this when my son was 4 months old.  I always thought it was pretty neat, but figured he wouldn't sleep in it, because it seems to glide too slow.  My son wouldn't sleep in anything, but his swing. I wanted to get him something bigger that may slightly imitate the swing that I know he'll sleep in. So based on reviews I got this product.  At first I was a little disappointed, because at night as soon as I laid him in it he would start too fuss like he did everything else, except his swing.  I just figured maybe I should have bought it a couple of months ago.  But, what I did was put one of his big blankets in it and laid him on top of it and whadduya know? He sleeps in it more than his swing now!  I guess it wasn't as cushiony as he wanted it to be.  I kind of noticed that too, when I got it that it appeared not to be as cushiony.  Another disappointing thing is that the music volume is a little loud even on the lowest setting, so I don't even use it.  Aside from that it's great.  The motor noise doesn't seem to bother me or my son.  It isn't very loud to me.  But anyway he sleeps in it, which allows me to get more me time and sleep time at night.  I would say my money is well spent	1
B00067TA1W:good_mattress,_good_price:k._m._oneal	I bought this same mattress in 2004 for my first son, and we never had any problems.  Easy to clean and firm; yet soft enough for my son to sleep through the night starting at 3 months.  When we were surprised at the news of a second, I bought this from Amazon on sale--the fabric design is different (blue and white checks), but otherwise it seems the same to me.  But one comment: if you don't get it on sale here you might try to buy it in store because the shipping is around $20.  It depends on what you're willing to pay for convenience	1
B000I2USMA:good_swing...:zeens	I love the plug-in feature, there's been many times I've left the swing on (have to rush to change a diaper and left it on). True, it will stop if lightly touched or a blanket falls.	1
B000GBGO26:great_little_tub:t._stigall	We love this tub & still use it with our daughter that is now almost 9 months old.  The incline position is great when they aren't quite ready to sit on their own.  We used to just place this over our kitchen sink & give her baths there. Now, we place it inside our regular bathtub because she isn't quite ready to be in the big tub yet.	1
B00070QJBC:at_long_last!!:j._perea_"mommy_of_4_toddlers!"	Finally! A big, spacious, nice looking toy box!!  I looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor, but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there!  The lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up.  The drawers on the bottom are small, but hold a few things, and don't take anything away from the big interior of the box.  It makes the box look more sofisticated!!  Love the new colors and design.  Thanks Little Tikes!	1
B00008YSRN:wonderful!:alexandra's_mum	Based upon reviews, I decided to go with Dr. Brown's from the start. We've been very happy with them! A friend had given me some Avent bottles she had never used so I decided to try them & compare. My baby had a terrible tummy ache & had never before burped so much. Those Avents now sit in the back of the cabinet gathering dust.	1
B00005BPEU:pretty_good_breathable_bumper:a._romano	I replaced my baby's old bumper with this one when she became mobile.  It works fairly well in keeping her from getting her arms or legs caught in between the crib slats.  The only complaint I have is that the "short" section of the bumper can be pushed down quite easily by the baby, thus defeating the purpose of keeping arms/legs inside the crib	1
B0009OLSY4:works_great_but_a_bit_pricey..:minh_do	My 3 yr. old son use it everyday to brush his teeth and comb his hair.  He doesn't tip over and fall anymore like he did on the other step chair.  The babybjorn is a bit expensive.  I found a similar chair at Ikea for a fraction of the cost.	1
B000BXHPEU:tricky_at_first,_but_overall_very_good.:j._means	I've had this seat for some time and I saw all of the negative reviews. It took a bit to figure out the quirks, but once I did, it was fine. The seat has to go on the very front of the public toilet, not the back or in the middle like mine at home. You have to make sure that it is on securely with the lip in the front against the front of the seat. Otherwise it will fold, which is probably what happened to the other reviewer. It will slid off as you come off if you're not careful. My five year old uses it by herself and I use it with my 2 year old. It is so compact that I can stick it in my purse (I carry in in a zippy bag) and very easy to clean. There aren't too many of this type of product out there, but for me, it works just fine	1
B0000W3TX8:excellent_carrier:s._mcdonald	I bought this carrier for a recent trip my family took and I am so glad I had it!  I used it for my 8 month old to carry her around instead of using a stroller.  There are many pockets which have plenty of room to store all your needed items and the stand works well to set down on the ground when not wearing it.  My daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in it and at one point even fell asleep.  She loved being able to see everything around her at our level.  I am 5'3" and my husband is 6'1" and we both wore it comfortably.  I would recommend this item to anyone needing something smaller than a stroller	1
B000B7CJKQ:my_wife_is_very_happy:david_c._morphis_"dave"	This particular pillow is wonderful because it is not cumbersome or too large to manage yet does everything my wife needs it to do.  I hardly know this pillow is in bed with us, and when I do notice it I can't help but to think of how nice and soft it is.  A great thing about the main squeeze is it is so versatile.  The pillow can be twisted and bent into any desired position.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it to all who are looking for something that will support all legs, pregnant belly, and face and hands.  One nice thing I forgot to mention is because it is sleek my wife has no problem turning with it when she feels the need to be on her other side.	1
B000CBUQSS:so_much_better_than_potty_chairs!:jaclyn_russell_"jaclyn_rich_(russell_is_my_maiden_name)"	This is so much better than any potty chair, and it is never in the way! Very easy to put on and my daughter loves it! She ahs been potty trained for a year but my nephew who is just now potty training loves it also!!	1
B0000AY9XY:love_these_bottles!:mdub	I love how wide they are.  This makes them much easier to clean and to handle.  Since they are shorter I can fit them on short shelves in my fridge when I use the stopper caps on them.  I can also fit them in my milk cooler in my breast pump because they are short.  My baby is able to hold them with ease since they are wider than other bottles.  Her arms don't have to stretch as far.	1
B0009VRPOO:awesome!:kristiane_panet_"happy_sleeper"	I think that this crib toy is awesome! Since my son was 3 months old we've turned it on every night at bedtime for him. He just watches the fishies swim around while the lights dance and the music plays. My son is now 7 months old and he still seems to like it.  And the cool thing is that now he is old enough to be able to interact with it.  If I switch it to manual MODE, he can turn on the music himself!  He can also play with the crackling feet and feel the silky material. Plus, he has another friend to keep him company in his crib (a big happy turtle with fish in his belly :-). Thus far, the straps haven't broken or cracked and I have removed it from the crib a couple of times. Also, the fish do swim around and the music does last for 15 minutes.  Its just a matter of which MODE you switch it to. (Reading the instructions really helps.) I strongly recommend this	1
B000056OVN:great_sheet_for_playard_bassinet:	I purchased this despite the reviews I read, out of desperation!  But have been very happy with the fit on my Eddie Bauer Morgan Gingham playard bassinet.  It is a little thin, however, I use a Carter's mattress pad underneath anyway, so I am not concerned with absorbancy.  It does the job as a nice surface to lay my son's head on, and I purchased one more in Navy to switch out when it is laundry time	1
B000BO3E4Y:gets_the_job_done!:ana_y_lat	It's kind of hard to get really excited about a changing pad, it gets the job done, it folds rather compactly, I think it's well worth the money	1
B000056OUF:i_am_so_happy_to_have_this......love_it:mom_of_4_"mom_of_4"	This has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk, formula and now baby food jars. It heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it. I wish this was around 12 years ago when we had our first child. I think that this is a very good investment, especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it doesn't heat ANYTHING evenly!!	1
B000I6I4XQ:works_great:sophia_lin_"sopapia"	you don't need the whole kit. only the loop and latch is needed. if you use the plastic, it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway.  you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing.  this way, you can use the softfit breastshield too	1
B000068NIM:it's_a_good_kit:teirra_howe	So far I haven't used much in this kit just because my son is only a month old and most the products are for older babies (also we haven't run into issues to need it) but I have used the nose aspirator and it's great.  It's soft and I don't fear hurting his nose!  I'm very excited to use the rest of the products	1
B0001CJ9Y0:great,_but_not_perfect:skaiste_cohen	I wish that it would zip up all the way... The top is coming down all the time and I have to adjusted. Maybe it's better for a two and up age child.	1
B00022OFSY:great_booster!:wendy	I did a lot of online and store researching before I bought this seat for my 3 1/2 year old son. My one concern was that my son is very slim and all the reviews talked about how the seat worked well for larger children. Well now I can say it works well for slim ones as well. He loves the arm rests and the cup holder. It is light weight and so easy to move and fold when necessary. We liked it so much we are going to buy  another one for when our 2 year son son is ready for that transition	1
B000BMEYFO:i_love_this_car_seat,_and_it_works_great_in_our_car!:erin_m._wilson_"olivia's_mommy"	I did plenty of research for a car seat for my firstborn, and the Snugfit got the best safety reviews.  And we just loved the pring- perfect for a boy or a girl.  I had heard how hard car seats were to install in the car, but it was a BREEZE.  I had it installed in the backseat within five minutes.  My car has the LATCH system, and it has worked great.  My daughter loves being in her car seat, and I have always felt perfectly safe with her in it.  I was surprised to read the other reviews, since I have never experienced a single one of those issues with my car seat.  I would highly recommend this seat to any parent	1
B0007Y51F8:not_the_best_design_but_ok_and_look_great:e._h._altman	I just bought these and my daughter looks adorable.  The first time I put them on she got a little fussy until she realized she could see through them.	1
B000BV4T9Q:excellent:d._ross	I have used several monitors in the past 7 years and chose this one due to the walkie-talkie feature.  It works well and has a great range.  The vibration is a nice feature so that you can turn down the sound when you have company and are having a conversation; no one else has to hear your little ones settling down for their sleep	1
B0007WHCZC:worth_its_weight_in_gold:melanie_mendelson_"i_fired_my_boss!_=&#62;_www.goforyourdreams.com"	When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!	1
B0007D9PVU:thank_you_protect_a_bub_:peggy_black	I love this shade! I am the mother of 2 girls, Alice 7 and Samantha 22 months. I never had anything like this for my oldest. It makes such a difference. The little one won't go out without it! Even though I always used Sunblock on Alice, her skin is still so much darker than Samantha's; I really believe it is because of the shade. I looked into a lot of other brands before choosing this one and I think it is the best one on the market. The others are made from Nylon/Lycra and I don't think that would hold up as well as this one does. Thank you Protect a bub	1
B0009JOSNW:pricey,_but_worth_it!:little_dragon_"theresa"	I had no idea that the Bjorn was so expensive, since I got it as a gift at my Baby Shower.  But knowing what I know now, Id definately spend the cash since its been such a blessing to have it.	1
B00004YMZE:evenflow_stair_guard:hal_j._strausberg	I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests.  The gate is built well...simple and functional.  It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily.  It went up easy and works as designed.  It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue.  In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close.  My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended.  Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs	1
B00007DWBV:infant_toddler_swing:lynne_a._ambrose	I love my fisher-price infant toddler swing.  I have two of them for my twin boys.  They love it and I know it is safe.  Also is it easy to get them in and out of.	1
B00064XFJ8:great_product,_a_must_for_eating_out:l._wade	We have been using these ever since our baby could feed herself and she's almost 2 now.  We keep them in the trunk of the car along with a box of "pocket bibsters."  Whenever we eat out at a restaurant, we stick this down at our toddler's place.  She sits in her chair and eats with us and if any food spills off of her plate, it spills onto this nice clean mat.  The mat also has entertainment value, as she can name the items on it.  After she's made her mess, we just peel the mat off, wad it up, and throw it away	1
B0007Z2JMA:it_works!:mommy_of_2_hula_girls!!	Used this for Double stroller while on vacation in Hershey Park -fantastic!  Easy to put on - easy to store!  I don't know why strollers - especially doubles - have such dinky canopies anyway!   But this did it's duty	1
B000AOEV1K:play_table:njgrandmom4	Play Table is sturdy and colorful and my grandson (18 months) loves it.  It is good for small children - better than just table and chairs which tend to tip over. I wish it were a little bigger but it will fit 4 smalls or 2 larger children nicely	1
B000G80RW2:cute_topper:h._soltis	FINALLY!!!  I am a stickler for matching things, with my other kids i used the urban bundle me and the original bundler but I LOVE having the matching hat for my December baby, I know she's warm.	1
B000BMJ6VG:p-e-r-f-e-c-t!:amm_"agawammommy"	We bought this stroller for my daughters: 4.5 years/38 pounds/42 inches and 2 years/26 pounds.  We were in the market for a new stroller because one of the wheels on our old double stroller had broken off twice and was about to break off again.  I was looking for a stroller that wouldn't make my older daughter feel like "a baby," but gave her the option of sitting during long trips to the mall, zoo, park, etc.  This stroller was the answer!	1
B000A7ZYOA:not_recalled-_love_this_set:michelle_micke	I love this key and cell phone set so much I'm buying another one for a friend.  I looked into the the recall and found that these keys were not part of the recall.  My 3 year old loves the recording feature on the cell phone.  (Actually even my older kids think it's pretty neat.)  Great product.. great price	1
B000A16ZO4:great_for_convertible_car_seats!:m._beck_"grayson's_mommy"	This is great for keeping the sun out of my baby's eyes- from all angles. And those on window shades always fall off, and are annoying when you want to roll the window down.. This does the job just fine. Highly recommend it	1
B000034DCJ:very_versatile_-_once_you_know_it's_many_uses!:a._harris	I purchased this sling from ebay for $8 and expected to use it to carry my newborn with one arm free and then be done with it, we did just that.  It has been sitting in my get rid of pile now for 8 months and then SURPRISE today I found a website that shows you how to get so much more out of this product, and after reading the instructions on the site and SEEING photos of how to do it, I now COMFORTABLY, have my son HANDS FREE in the sling with a hip straddle position and he is totally secure.  I am petite and this is one size fits all, you CAN pull the sling through the rings more than just the tail to make it tighter.  If you have problems with the baby being secure, you just need to pull up the material high on the back (theirs and yours) AND tuck it between their legs too - see the site for photos to better understand.  I am now VERY impressed with this product, a little knowledge goes a long way!  The site is polarbearcreations dot com slash pages slash howtouse dot php  ~ once you see how to use this product correctly, you WILL LOVE IT!  :o)  I do now	1
B00009NQU0:very_convenient:k._pollmann	We have twins and these mattress pads are much more convenient than trying to wrestle with getting new sheets on the cribs in the middle of the night.  They are holding up well through frequent washings and are easy to attach.  I gave it 4 stars because it's not extremely soft, though it isn't bad.  I also like that the top layer is breathable - gives me peace of mind	1
B00078ANK2:thank_goodness_i_tried_this_bottle!:m._hughes_"mickeynorm"	My daughter was having horrible gas pains and we tried everything under the sun to help her out.  Then, we switched to these bottles and it worked like magic.  AMEN!  I don't care how many parts there are -- it is totally worth the sleep we are now getting	1
B000056HND:love_this_crib!:happy_homemaker_"helen"	The Safety 1st Cosco Portable Crib is great!  I purchased this for my first grandchild when she visits.  It's small enough to fit anywhere and it can easily be rolled from one room to another.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to a full size crib.  It is very sturdy and also attractive	1
B000BXAI08:great_quality:elaine	I have yet to use this chair as I am a grandma awaiting the arrival of her first grandchild, but from what I can see, this high chair has everything a larger chair offers but in a lot less space! It is very sturdy and well put together and I am already recommending it to friends	1
B00009VE5O:j_cole_bundle_me_infant_cover:kelly_"prairie_girl"	Absolutely LOVE this product!!  Wish I had had one for my other 3 children.  We live in cold and windy North Dakota and this is just so easy to use.  There have been times my little one has gotten too hot when I over bundle him in it.  I recommend this to any one expecting a little one in the winter months.	1
B00063EDEK:cuddle_pillow:amygiraffe	I have used this pillow for the last 2 months, with 2 to go.  I do like the shape of the pillow, I just wished it was a little longer.  I had been trying to use a king size pillow to cuddle with, but it was TOO big and hard to turn with.  This pillow makes it easy to keep next to you and to turn over.  I would just like it to be longer so I can have the little end between my legs, and the rest up higher so I can cuddle with it.  When between my legs (which helps) the rest of the pillow only is around my stomach and I wish it came up to my breast area so my arms could cuddle around it a little easier.  I would still give one to a pregnant friend as it is nice to sleep with.  Beware, my husband calls this the "Sperm Pillow", but if you can get past that, it's a nice pillow.	1
B0009OLSZ8:great_potty_chair:b._ram	I have twin boys that are 3 and I love this chair.  It doesn't have a lid or removable splash gurad.  I have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with.  Putting the lids up and down, taking out the removable seat and catch basin, etc.	1
B00005BXKM:don't_spend_any_more_money!:numom	When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing	1
B000056OUH:sterilising_is_important_to_protect_your_baby:l._mcallister	I have used this product with all three of my children and it has been great. Easy to use and quick to sterilise.	1
B000HEG7HO:love_it:kornelia_"kornelia"	the fabric is soft and cushion, and what's most important it provides good support for my baby. She loves it	1
B00005BW6I:this_item_is_perfect_for_the_beach!:laura_c_hamrick	I shopped around for a cabana to take to the beach, for my sons first visit. I found this one, and let me tell you, it was perfect! It was so easy to set up and take down, and it was sturdy enough to stand up to the high beach winds. I saw a lot of other tents/cabanas on the beach and this one by far was the best; both price and durability wise. Excellent find and buy	1
B00005V9NX:best_on_the_market!:charissa	When I purchased mine, there was no Diaper Dekor+ which is the larger size.  However, I feel that we have no need for a larger one.  My child just turned two and it holds a weeks worth of diapers...no problem!  I bought the Diaper Genie because I was told so many things about it and I hate it, it goes through bags quickly and the bags have a weird odor to them.  I am currently pregnant and am sensitive to odors and the Diaper Dekor holds them all in until garbage day comes	1
B000CDPHIK:mikey_likes_it:emmaline_allen_"gatormommy"	my son loves this jumper.  it gives him a sense of independence.  he likes to rock from one leg to the other and then he spins completely around	1
B0006FHB92:a_good_buy:s._field_"pregnant_and_bored"	I was that parent who said "I'll never spoil my child with a wipe warmer--it will only encourage her to wear diapers longer." And then I woke up and realized that warm wipes at night mean a baby who doesn't cry during changings and goes back to bed more easily--this could mean an extra half hour of sleep for me. I am now a big fan of the warmer. It works very quickly and doesn't dry them out, and the light is just bright enough to change the baby at night without waking her up. Definately a nice product.	1
B000I2UJ0Q:the_best_toy_!!!:m._gaur	Great, fun product. My baby boy plays in it for up to 30 min. couple times a day. We own it from 2 months, he was 4 months old, he simply loves it. He jumps and plays with the toys. Absolutely the best buy	1
B00007DWBH:great_product:lezlie_c._simunek	I purchased this product for my hubby's vehicle and we LOVE not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time. It works great, highly recommended	1
B0001WAO9O:works_good:jack_and_violet's_momma	I had a fabric seat saver for my leather seats before. Needless to say fabric doesn't protect leather very well. I ended up with deep depressions in the leather. Hopefully the leather will go back (fingers crossed). The firm bottom piece seems to work well to prevent any more indentations from showing up. And both of the carseats are as secure as ever. I have the rear and forward facing models.	1
B000E9T8GO:excellent_dog_gate:mary_jones	I need a gate to keep my dogs out of my guest room.  It's used for an office and playroom, and it's the coldest room in the house so I like to keep the door open.  My daughter's friend broke her arm climbing over a wooden pressure gate that we had when it fell, so I bought this one.  It took 7 minutes to install, it's not going anywhere, and it's very easy to open and close.  My dogs can't climb over it because the bars are vertical.  I love it, am very pleased and plan to buy another one for my 8-year-old daughter's bedroom	1
B00005BPK5:don't_give_up!:nomad_family	I love this sling!  But I'd like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you.  It may be too big for your newborn.  I started using it when my son was 4 weeks, but he was a large baby.	1
B0000E2DIE:i_love_it:	This product has really worked well for me!  My daughter used to love pushing her Barbie dolls in between the posts on our loft to see them crash onto the table below!  Now we don't have to worry about this anymore.  She can't reach her arm through these posts anymore either.  I use window cleaner to clean the smudge	1
B0000669AJ:brings_lots_of_smiles:lcl	My daughter plays with this toy at Grandma's house. Theses &quot;instruments&quot; are usually the first toys she pulls out to play with. The bright colors and different noises definitely interest her. She loves to shake them and make noise. They are great little toys to throw in the diaper bag when you're on the go	1
B000GKWA66:sleep_sheep_is_the_best!:r._mubeen	My daughter loves to cuddle with the soft sleep sheep and I love this product because it puts her right to sleep with the calm soothing sounds! I love the rain! even I fall asleep listening to it.	1
B000056J2D:cooshie_booster:april_l._neal	The booster works great, does not slip on a chair, and is easy for my 2 year old to move around on her own.  I highly recommend this product	1
B000056HLX:son_figured_it_out_at_age_27_months:skrapbooker_"skrapbooker"	The crib tent is great!  We originally got it to keep our cats out, but then it served the purpose of keeping our son in too.  :)  UNTIL...  at 27 months, he learned how to reach through the crib slats & undo the zipper!!!!  :-o  So now we're in a hurry to get a toddler bed this week!	1
B0002CRS9M:i_love_this_product:s._stropas_"stropas"	I didnt know these things exsisted with my first child, now that I found them I use it constantly! This floppy seat is much better then others you can get for a little cheaper, but in the long run this is the best for your money! I have washed it at least half a dozen times, and its washes great! I also am so glad to have one seat the works for the cart as well as the highchair. THe other products I saw you had to buy one for each item. It was almost double the cost.	1
B000CSCIG4:very_simple,_stylish:reddevil	My son is not actually anywhere close to understanding the concept of this, but my impression is that it is VERY simple to clean up (which I LOVE the idea of).  It seems comfy, he sits in it often and plays with it sometimes :	1
B000056J76:fantastic_potty_seat!:mommiephd	My daughter started with the Baby Bjorn stand alone potty seat - which was great when she was just getting started with the idea of using a potty. She quickly became too tall to use the stand alone potty seat, so I ordered this Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer and it has been fantastic. She quickly learned how to put the seat on the toilet herself and adjust the wheel to make it snug. It was also easy for her to remove and hang on a small butterfly doorknob my husband attached to the side of the sink cabinet. The seat gave her a great sense of independence and allowed her to be comfortable and secure while learning to use the big potty.	1
B0009XBX4K:hygienic,_convenient_and_environmentally_friendly!:lucy_penn_"first_time_mom"	Medela products are all great--these containers came sterile and are so convenient to store pumped milk--one can add the medela nipple and feed the baby directly from the container. Very useful! Highly recommended	1
B000056J7K:great_chair,_and_easy_to_use_and_clean:s._campbell	This chair is larger than some of the seats out there, and fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well. Some seem like they would be really hard for a boy to use, as things tend to spray out of the smaller seats! The seat is shaped just right for splashes, and it seems comfortable. Now if only my little guy would use it more than once a day, we'd be in business! I love the simple design, my son loves the color (he picked it out himself), and it's so simple to clean. It also has grips on the bottom so that it won't slide on the bathroom floor when he sits in it -- a must	1
B000B90G9K:wonderful,_comfortable,_bather:a._gandhi	We are using this bather for our son who is one month old. What we like most about this bather is that the water drains away from the baby.  The fabric is also very soft, quick drying, and removable for machine washing.  The model we have does include straps that can be adjusted around the baby's waist.  To keep him warm, we pour cupfuls of warm water on him throughout his bath.  Since we don't fill up the tub with water, slippage has not been a problem	1
B000B8WCFM:best_travel_pillow_i've_used:gine	This pillow works! Sleeping in the car used to make my son cranky	1
B0000A1O7P:high_praise:lili_p.	I bought this chair second-hand for my six month old son, and he loves it (whereas he hated the hard wooden restaurant high chairs).  It's a great size, easy to use, good color for hiding stains, and comfortable for him to sit in.  Best of all, because it folds up so easily and comes with a carry bag, we can be sure that he doesn't get exposed to the germs of every other little kid who frequents the restaurants where we eat!	1
B0002U3QQ8:i'm_really_glad_i_bought_it:tina_m._bajic_"tinab"	This  bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed. It feels so good knowing he's so close. Its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps. Oh yeah, and its really cute	1
B000BF2V4W:essential_baby_item:melanie_mendelson_"i_fired_my_boss!_=&#62;_www.goforyourdreams.com"	When my daughter was born, I didn't know about swaddling, and it would take me HOURS to get her to sleep! I would feed or rock her in my arms until she falls asleep, then put her in her crib... and she'd flail her arms, wake up and cry, and I had to start all over! What a nightmare!	1
B000GJIE3K:wonderful_bibs:a._vanselus	These bibs are the best. My son is a messy eater and loves to drink water and spit it out. When meal time is over his shirt is dry and all the water is in the handy pouch. Must have for any new parent	1
B0001BUK9Y:great_manual_pump._:t._lopez	I bought this pump after the Avent Isis failed me along with an electric pump. The fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great. Im able to empty each breast in 15 min or less sometimes. Although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy. From reading the other reviews I think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable. Remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply. If you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby. And they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday.	1
B000231GF8:one_less_thing_to_wash:keri_a._white_"whiteybear"	I love love loooooove this system! I have been pumping exclusively for 4 months now and only found this about a month ago. Before this, I was pumping and storing in Medela bottles, then transferring to Playtex liners before feeding. Then I had to wash all the Medela bottles, plus Playtex rings, etc.	1
B0000CEDRO:extremely_sensitive,_detects_even_lungs_moving_or_heartbeat!:investor_"pk"	I have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity.  At first, I was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok.  So I took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby, ... it stopped ticking.  The baby was not moving, but just it's heart and/or lungs working keeps the unit ticking.  It detects even when you blow on the sensor.  Maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity, since ceiling fans, etc might activate it, but I was truly amazed with the sensitivity.	1
B00029TCW6:looks_beautiful,_though_instruction_manual_is_terrible:j._mayer_"amazon_buyer"	The chest looks as in the picture and that is what I liked, though the instruction manual can not get any worse than this.  My husband is very handy so he did not have such a hard time, although it took him 5 hours to put together, he got through it fine.  Instructions are not clear and they do not guide you right either but the chest looks nice in my baby room	1
B000G82GO4:wonderful_entertainment!:kidsfirst	My son is 5 months old and LOVES this jumper!!!  He can keep himself entertained and I am able to do some things with both hands!  Plus, it's so much fun watching him bounce himself up and down, laughing!	1
B0001XLS84:so_glad_i_bought_it!:yvonne_m._jones_"beyond_normal"	I'm a mother of a 21-month-old. I just got a puppy and was having a hard time managing the stroller AND the leash on our walks. This backpack is perfect. It fits me well and my daughter loves it. She asks to stay in it when we're done! I was worried about that because she never liked any of the baby carriers I've tried before when she was younger. You do have to toughen up your shoulders (by taking shorter walks at first) before going on any long hikes, of course. I don't understand the chest problem on one of the other reviews, because the chest strap is adjustable, long, and sits just below the shoulders, avoiding the "busty" area very well. However, it does come out of the box at the shortest setting, so you have to loosen it to fit your frame. The question of being able to "close" the frame with the child in it doesn't seem to be an issue on mine. The stand part folds up easily under the child once the child is on your back. You do need long enough arms to grab it behind you, though. It makes no difference to you or the child if you leave the frame in the open position during your walk, but if you're in tight quarters, you'll want to close it. I did make the mistake of trying to put Aeryn's (my daughter's) feet behind me in the frame at first, which made her knees rest uncomfortably on the frame. The legs are supposed to go naturally forward toward either side of your waist. (The picture on the box helped me figure that out.) It is for kids from 6 months up to 36 months, and comes with a clear rain shield that easily zips onto the retractable sun shield. The rain shield is also helpful in windy conditions- my daughter thinks it's cool and leans over to fog it with her breath. It's not easy to do with a six-month-old puppy jumping around on you, but I've even managed to get into the straps and stand up from the floor with Aeryn in the pack (I'm reasonably fit, and she's just under 30 pounds). This thing is rugged, comfortable, good-looking, and has "be prepared" features like a cellphone holder and a matching fanny pack (that can be carried on the frame, if you'd rather)	1
B000GJIE4E:these_bibs_are_great!:mn_twin_mama	They're a little pricey, but they work great.  They are easy to clean, dry quickly, and catch almost all the mess my boys make	1
B00063E23M:okay!:shauna_lynch_"shauna_lynch"	I don't know what one of the reviewies was talking about.. if you read the manual, you will learn that you need to move the "leg" on the front so that the seat sits Level.  That will keep your childs' head from falling forward.  If that fails, go to Burlington Coat Factory and get a wedge, to prop it up more.. (to most moms I know this has been common purchase)	1
B000JHN3AS:traveling_lifesaver!:r._dean_"aloha_traveler"	I bought this product after reading the many positive reviews below, and I was thoroughly satisfied.  My only complaint was actually with my luggage, as the handle on my bag was a little short so I had to stoop a little while I was pushing/pulling it.  Everyone who saw it thought it was the neatest invention ever, especially other moms traveling with kids.	1
B000056HMB:great_with_practice:s._wilson	This is a great product. It takes a little practice to get the right amount of water. Disposables take much less b/c they tend to trap the steam, etc. I don't see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true. Sure it boils the water - it has to make steam! But why would you reach inside there? There is no reason I can think of why you'd ever need to do that. And with the first 2 children we used this on, I've never had a bottle even become remotely stuck, snug, you name it - not even close - so don't worry about it. I've used Avent 4oz and 9oz bottles as well as Playtex disposable bag bottles. It's not really a good use of money if you're just using formula - just make it with warm water. But if you're nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night, this is a must have...	1
B00005V95L:fun_toy,_some_minor_problems:a._torres	My daughter got this toy when she was 2 months old and she still loves it (at 8 months).  It was the only toy that would keep her entertained on car trips at first.	1
B0002U1TRG:what_a_great_seat:mom_of_4_boys	I have always had Graco infant seats for my children. I got this one for baby number 4 and love it. It is so cute! And the cover is just wonderful for the fall and winter months. Also, I LOVE the color of it.	1
B000GKVQDY:we_like_this_monitor:angela_mccarter	We got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it. We have a Graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice. You can hardly hear her on it.	1
B00069BVEE:worth_every_penny!:bags	The PISA is an amazing pump and the cost is equal to a few months of formula, so my pump has already paid for itself (used for 6 months and still going strong)! I've tried generic immitations and they just don't compare. Invest your money in the real thing, it's worth it	1
B000069EXQ:they're_great!!!:aj_"aj"	I got four of these sleepsacks, two fleece and two cotton.  I found the fleece sleepsacks do get bitty after a couple of washes, but it didn't effect the product.  They are wonderful.  If you are buying for a newborn, get the 6-12 month size, since it'll last a bit longer. I ended up giving away the 0-6 month size, when my baby was only 3 months old, as it was getting a bit small.	1
B000COV1PM:i_love_this!!!:erin_caldwell	I don't know what the reviewers before me were talking about.  I use this at Kroger, Giant Eagle and Target and don't have any problems with it fitting a regular buggy at the store.  It's sturdy, and easy to use.  Don't pass this one up	1
B00005Q8NP:no_issue_hanging!_adorable!:newparents0306	These wall hangings are lovely.  The different textures are very cool.  Maybe mine were different than everyone elses, but they came with little ribbon loops on the back, and i don't get why there's an issue hanging them.  They're very very cute, and look adorable in the room.	1
B000096M5Y:confusing_amazon_picture-variety_pack?????:kathryn_a._smith_"bean42069"	I bought the 100 pack thinking it was all the ultra thin kind, which I love, come to find out only 60 of them are ultra thin.  Some of the women on here complain about having to change their pads often - you really are supposed to do that, because otherwise you will get an breast infection, especially if you live in the south where it's warm and humid.  I recommend the ultra thin pads, the other ones that come in the variety pack are just "OK"	1
B0000789TK:don't_fly_without_it!:d._garibaldi	We purchased this carrier for our sons car seat 4 years ago.  For perspective, we are heavy travelers with 4-6 international trips/year and always bring our son's car seat along. This carrier has been indispensable for us. It fits our large Britax Roundabout, plus has space for a bag of diapers, soft toys or the extra shopping from our trips.  We use the back pack or wheels to tote it around airports or onto planes. As our son grew large enought to not need the seat on the plane, we simply check it through as a piece of luggage.  The material is lightweight and we have had a few small tears along the bottom of the bag, but we were able to repair them easily enough by ourselves with needle and thread. We just adopted a second child and bought the same carrier again for her car seat as well	1
B000GKL0YO:good_stroller_for_the_price:emily_martin	We like this stroller.  It seems to be pretty durable, and its weight and portability (shoulder strap) make it ideal for trips, especially in airports.  My husband has a hard time pushing it sometimes because he is so tall (6'4"), but it is fine for me (5'3").  We like it for our 5-month-old son because he is able to recline, but still sit up enough to watch what's going on.  He can hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet, so the various levels of the reclining back are nice.  Overall, a good stroller for the price	1
B000GJIE30:superbib:florence_r._schule_"grandma"	The best bib around!  Wash and dry, and large enough to catch everything.  I will never again use another bib	1
B000067UXF:tike_tech_all-terrain_double_jogging_stroller_-_pacific_blue:william_john_willis	When we first got the stroller, it pulled to the left significantly, but we got on the phone with Tike Tech and they were extremely helpful and accomodating. The stoller works great now.  I have taken it running with my two girls - it is very stable and drives smoothly	1
B000F1OAE6:safest_out_there:kc-mama	I did A TON of research on convertible infant-toddler car seats before my son outgrew his Graco SnugRide at 4 months. Consumer Reports gave this and another seat the highest safety ratings (this seat had the highest rating of all Britax convertible seats!) I chose this seat because it has EPS side-impact protection under the carseat cover. It's worth the extra money because it's your child's life! Also, it's really easy to tighten and loosen the straps, and the cover is really silky and comfortable. My son falls asleep within minutes of pulling out of the driveway.	1
B000BZ6BHK:great_for_spring_baby!:e.lemay	i got this for my baby due in march. even though i live in new england area i knew the original bundle me would be too heavy. its perfect wieght for the 50-75 degree weather. it stays on the infant carseat at all times and that way my husband will never forget to have a blanket for the baby. it washes well too! if you do get a day here and there when its a lot warmer and you don't need it then the top part zips off and you don't have to take baby out and remove the entire product. then the next chilly day zip the top back on! great all around	1
B0007CQ6QS:great_product_and_really_fast_shipping:h._nye	This jogger is great - I love the quick fold feature and my daughter seems very comfy in it - no complaints, in fact she seems to look forward to going on runs w/ mo	1
B000058DPL:it_works.:james_sharp_"marvin_gaye"	It does indeed adapt it so you can run the thing in the car.  My wife used it on a cross-country trip we took and it basically saved our lives.  Well, not our lives, but it does work	1
B000046S2U:great_for_cloth_diapers:art_lover_"artlover"	this bin is great for cloth diapers. we love ours. keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two's worth of diapers-- which is all i need because we wash every other day. Our local Babies R Us sells replacement deodisks (or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors) when the one that comes with it loses it's smell so that you can maintain freshness. It's easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive	1
B000056HM5:awesome_system:j._lye	I have tried these for the first time with my fourth child. I wish I would have used this system for all my children. I have used all kinds of bottles from the old glass bottles to Vent-air to Avent...many types with my first 3 children. I decided to give these a try considering I was tired of scrubbing bottles. My little girl switched to these very easily from the breast, it helped tremendously with her colic by cutting down on gas (switching from regular formula to soy helped to, plus I had to start avoiding all milk products while breastfeeding)plus they are so easy to clean and manage. I have had no leak problems like I did with Avent...Vent-air #1 nipple would collapse plus my son would have projectile spit-up after feedings when I tried to switch him to the #2 nipples (awful system)...absolutely no problems with the original Playtex bottles. My only minor complaint is trying to fit my fingers in the bottle to collapse the liner to rid of air...very hard if you do not have tiny hands. We bought the easy-feed bottles with the lift in the bottom to aid in releasing air...alittle easier. Store brand liners work just as well as brand name liners...I have seen no difference except in price. Target brand is very good. I would recommend these bottles to everyone	1
B0000E6ZC6:pretty_good:lynn_edler	I got this system for my 18 mo. old who was playing a game by sticking his leg through the slats of his crib and then claiming he was "stuck".  They have helped prevent him from doing that any more.  However, if he's in the mood, he can easily dismantle the entire contraption - so it won't work to keep an older child from tearing it apart if they want to.  In fact, the two end panels had to be removed because he wouldn't leave them alone.  All in all though, I think the mesh "bumpers" do what they claim and they work well at keeping toys (and pluggers) in the crib instead of out on the floor	1
B00016BPA2:a_little_tip!:angela_b._martin_"med_school_mom"	The Medela breast pump works with Dr. Brown's bottles (you can pump directly into the bottle)!  Just an added benefit to an already great product.  I've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems.  It's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months	1
B000E9TD2I:b.o.b._revolution:jason_thomas	B.O.B. Rocks. BOB is very high quality and has held up extremely well for us after nearly 2 years of use. We're a little attached to BOB in our house. Let me tell you the Revolution is the stroller to get. We bought it right after our baby was born, choked up $40 or so for the infant seat bar and have used it as our primary stroller ever since. Even in the mall, department stores, etc it's great. Baby gets a smooth ride and daddy likes it because it's agile and almost effortless to push. I see hundreds of Bugaboo strollers around and I must admit they are nice but B.O.B is my choice because of price and you can go more places with him.	1
B0000798L1:we_love_this_chair!:sprite_marie	I have a home daycare, so this chair is used constantly. I've had two of these for well over a year, and today I bought a third one. I've tried several different seats in the past and this one is the best by far. Nothing beats the swinging tray. I would recommend it to anyone	1
B000BYCC1K:good_monitor:j._r._blommaert	Good baby monitor overall.  Sound quality is good except we are getting an occasional clicking sound and I can't find where the interference is coming from	1
B000066CMV:love_it:t._tait	Great product - I heard from other mommies that this was the pump to get; I agree	1
B000JOOG1Q:terrific_booster!:barbara_stephen-macri_"yakgoddess"	This is so much better than those crappy plastic boosters I can't believe we didn't buy it sooner.  It's easy to clean and doesn't slide off the chair.  Our son fits in it perfectly and now feels like a big boy.  It even has a little carrying bag to take on trips.  Great vendor with quick delivery too	1
B000B775DC:highly_recommended:beatlemom	Our little guy was sleeping comfortably in his stroller for the first several months we brought him home. When we tried to transition him to the crib, he was startled by the large space and would cry or sleep very poorly. As he outgrew the stroller, we tried to think of ways to emulate the coziness of the stroller inside his crib (lots of attempts - not an easy task!!). He's 5 1/2 months old and we now use the Sleep Nest in the crib as well as putting him in the larger sized SwaddleMe at night. He loves the closeness and sleeps very soundly. The Sleep Nest is small enough to be cozy, but large enough for him to move comfortably. It fits very nicely into the crib and is also portable which is great since he enjoys being on the go	1
B000BYDXP4:great_gates:t._wyles	We are in Italy with these huge, weird shaped stairways. These gates are great and just what we were looking for. Easy to install, easy to use once up. They look nice in our house	1
B000G82HWU:love_it_already!:shannon_daly_"alexis'_mom"	I just received my travel set today and I already love it! The bottle pod is more than big enough for the biggest bottle I have. The pacifier pod holds my daughters pacifier perfectly and the diapers and wipes pod is just too perfect for quick trips to the store or a friends house. I highly recommend it	1
B000B5HELW:diaper_bag_for_dads_too:harry_hood	It was nice of my "ninth month wife" to agree upon a diaper bag that I wasn't too embarrassed to carry. Now that the baby's here, I've found it to be functional as well as comfortable; it easily holds enough clothes, diapers and stuff, and doesn't feel like you're carrying an elephant. No complaints at all, it's a great bag	1

B0006BAJK4:my_new_favorite_baby_gift:lisa_bennett	I bought this for my second son who is a year old.  I love it.  It's compact and fits easily in the diaper bag.  After he eats, I take it to the restroom and it rinses right off.  I've started using it at home too because the little tray in the front catches food really well (and saves my floors!).  I recommend anyone who hates to see their child rub their food all over the germy table buy this!!	1

B000BZ6BAW:so_far,_so_good:aegina_barnes	I received this stroller about a week ago, and so far, we love it.  The ride is smooth, it's very light, and I love the salmon color.  The shade comes in handy, too.  It has all the features I'd want while still remaining ight and streamlined.  It's a little awkward to close, but I'm a bit of a klutz, so I assume others might not have this problem.  The handles are great, though, and they're very comfortable for my husband (6 feet) and me (5'7".)	1
B0002TEG9U:safety_1st_grip_n'_go_walker:spoiled_rotten_"stacey"	I brought this walker for my grandson and he loves it. He alway's playing with the objects and is actually walking now. This wallker was easy to assemble also.	1
B000EMZAZO:changing_pad:leslie_lankford	This seems to be a decent changing pad with the exception of it not being easy to clean. I am having a real hard time cleaning it and never had this problem with other changing pads. It's almost porous! If you get this changing pad, plan on having a cover on it at all times to keep it clean.	1
B0009RG8X2:best_money_spent!!!:sydni_b._gwinn_"delaney's_mom"	Out of all the loads of baby gear I bought- this is by far the best money I spent.  I thought, its a little spendy, but super cute.  After my preemie came home the 3rd week of November and it was 27 degrees... I realized how great this thing was.  Its super snuggly for her and keeps her warm.  No need for a jacket that would mess up her straps!  also in the wind and the rain, to just be able to flip it over her face is so great!  This is way better that the ones with sherpa inside in my opinion.  My daughter will be able to use it well into Spring.  Not to mention, not a day goes by that I don't get a compliment on the sack and people asking where I got it.  Love it Love it	1
B000F1OPZ0:forget_the_floppy,_this_is_the_one_to_buy.:ic_"ic"	In my months of 'experimentation' and a few purchases in err, this is the best product of its sort out there.	1
B000056W7R:if_you_have_children_(or_earthquakes)_consider_this!:w._davis-thrash_"wdt"	We have these straps all over our house (on every piece of furniture taller than two feet), because we have two "climbers." There have been two occasions that I know of where these saved my eldest daughter from injury, as she climbed large pieces of furniture.	1

B000BM8FR2:good_flow,_too_wide.:jls_"jls"	I havent had any problems with the bottles leaking like others have stated, but I guess I always check and make sure the lid is on right.  The suction isnt too fast, which is great.  My baby doesnt get choked.  She latches easily to the nipple since it is the same as the pacifier that she loves.  My only gripe is that since the bottles are so wide they cover the whole lower part of her face and it smooshes her nose.  There isnt a curve in the bottle, so when the milk gets low you either have to lean the baby back more, which I dont like, or either mash the bottle on her nose.  Its avoidable, but I tend to do it whithout realizing sometimes.  Id rather just stick with a bottle like playtex with a curver or a bottle that is slimer.  I still use the bottles, but I just have to make sure the whole time I'm feeding that it isnt mashing her nose so she can breath	1
B000H2BLK4:fantastic_stroller,_and_for_the_price_it_couldn't_be_better:wooky	For the price how can you go wrong, it is absolutely FULL FEATURED, besides a lot of features of the stroller itself, you get a uv shade cover, a raincover, and a cover for the legs (the boot; useful when it is cold). Easy to open and close, a breeze to push, I can even manage with one hand, baby is happy in it.  Only wish it could recline with one hand. The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller, get a bit stuck on ours, but maybe 'cos it is new. Even if I knew that would happen, I still would buy this stroller, it is something I can live with. It is almost half the price of the 2007 models, which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric. The color though is not really what I expected from a teal, it is more of a dirty blue	1
B0007R4J4Y:peace_of_mind:e._waddell	The Snuggle Nest gave my husband and I peace of mind while co-sleeping with our son.  I thought about purchasing the Arm's Reach Co-sleeper but my son wanted to be REAL close to us through the night.  Our son is ten weeks old and it still works.  It is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a Cesarean that proved to be a little difficult.  I'm hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the Snuggle Nest by putting the Snuggle Nest into his crib.  The little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night (the bedside light wakes my husband.	1

B000056HNZ:awesome_pump--even_for_a_full-time_working_mom:new_mom	I LOVE my Avent pump. Even though I knew I would be returning to work when my son was just 6 weeks old, I was reluctant to spend the money on an expensive electric pump until I knew if breastfeeding would be right for us. Now, my son is almost 6 months old and I'm still using my manual pump. I take 2 15-minute breaks each day and find that I can easily keep up with my son's milk needs. On the days that I have trouble getting my milk to flow, I find that it has much more to do with my stress level than the pump's efficieny. (On those nights, I nurse on one side while I pump on the other.) I would definitely recommend this pump as a great value for the price	1
B000056JAZ:great_storage_containers_for_breast_milk:rachel	I use the Medela pump - but their thin bottles and simple caps don't seem like they have the ability to keep the milk fresh. I love the heavy Advent bottles and the caps have a rubber ring in them to really seal the bottle	1
B0000AY9Y0:only_leaks_when_over_tightened:turkey's_mom	I tried several types of bottles when supplementing nursing. Even the Playtex nursers which I liked with my older children caused gas and fussiness with my son. I had received a free Avent nurser, so I tried it and the problem was eliminated. I bought the newborn set and some extras, not cheap, but worth it for a content baby! I was quite upset when they began leaking, then I discovered that unlike other bottles that leak if you don't tighten as much as possible, if you tighten Avent fully and then loosen by about a half turn, they don't leak! No gas, no leaks, happy baby	1

B000COWM8C:a_leash_without_looking_like_a_leash!:m._dane	I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!	1
B000BZ6BAM:best_stroller_ever!:c._clarfield	This new Maclaren stroller is fantastic! We just returned from three weeks in France with this great stroller.  It can roll down an aisle on an airplane and negotiate the rocks and bumps of any street. It is very light and we love the new shoulder strap.  I have 3 kids and this is the best stroller I have ever used	1

B000GEFGTK:affordable_luxury:natalie_mommy_of_5	this seat caught my attention because of the higher weight and height capacity, 29 inches and 22lbs but this seat is also very well made the padding is exceptional compared to evenflo and graco every where is padded the head rest has additional egg shock support and it comes with an additional body pillow for newborns ,until the pillow gets snug and you have to remove it.my daughter was 13lbs and 8 ounces and 25 inches at her 4 month old wellbaby check up in june ,now six months old she still fits and is not hanging out at all.i have to wonder if the previous reviewer removed the body pillow .it does get snug and then you have to use the seat without the pillow.why not five stars ?the instructions are bad the seat is much easier to install without the base.but a good seat overall	1
B00029TCRQ:excellent_product_at_an_affordable_price!:d.h._messer	I would like to state that I take issue with the previous reviews, in that they claim this piece is flimsy. It is NOT at all flimsy, nor does it look cheap. In fact, my husband and I have the entire set (changing table and dresser), along with the Montery Crib.  When you receive the boxes, there is an instruction booklet that clearly states that the manufacturer, not the store, will handle all returns, exchanges, or shipping of missing parts. Well, we had a question regarging set-up of this product and thought there was a defect. We spoke with Storkcraft directly, and found thqat we were not following the assembly directions properly. Storkcraft was exremely helpful and pleasant, and promised us that we could return the item at any time to them DIRECTLY, and they would arrange for a prompt exchange.  This piece looks beautiful, and serves its purpose as a infant/child dresser. I am sure that you could spend $1,000 on a high-end piece, but if you are looking for something that is 1) AFFORDABLE, and 2) WELL-MADE, and 3) BEAUTIFUL, then Storkcraft is a good choice	1
B000BK8RHW:soothie_bottles:leah's_nana	My granddaughter was 6 weeks premature and at 4 lbs , she had no problem with the soothie bottle , the pacifer she loves , the bottles are easy to clean and love that the cap snaps on the bottom of the bottle while feeding , like the little cups to hold the powder formual .Haven't had a problem with the bottles leaking . Love the ones with the designs of Winnie-the-Pooh on them , wish they came in the 3 bottle set , also wish you could buy the little snack( formula ) containers seperately not just in the large sets .  Would recommend for any baby .	1
B00027O0ZM:worked_great_with_real_underwear_incentive.:mommyofchristopher_"mommyofchristopher"	I bought Elmo Underwear from Ebay with a sports theme, and was done training in a couple of weeks.

B000FT9J3K:great_crib_at_a_great_price!:michael_mckenna	My wife and I just finished putting this crib together.  It took a total of 25 minutes start to finish.  The instructions were extremely easy to follow.  We bought this exact crib in honey oak 18 months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well, we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two.  Our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together.  The only adjustments we have done, where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower.  Even that process only took a matter of minutes.  I have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up.  When ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough, but the crib pieces inside are very well packed, padded, and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish.  The super saver free shipping arrived at our door 6 days from date of purchase.  I have never wrote a review for an online purchase before, but we are so pleased with our two cribs that I wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib.	1
B00029TCVC:very_nice:maricela_saenz_"luna"	The armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because I was expecting something else. I still like it very much but I wanted a part to hang clothes and it doesn't have one. It is very pretty and from the outside it was everything I was expecting!!!	1
B0007SMK0S:great_crib_if_your_space_is_limited:melanie_mendelson_"i_fired_my_boss!_=&#62;_www.goforyourdreams.com"	We have 2 kids in a 2-bedroom apartment.  When our 2nd child was born, we put him in our bedroom.  There is not much space there, so this portable crib was a great find!  We use it as a permanent crib until our son outgrows it.	1
B00078ZHNU:very_cute_and_big:chantel_j._romero_"mama_romero"	I was surprised at what a good size this rug was.  It matches the bedding perfect.  The only negative thing I can say about it, is that it tends to scoot around a little bit when you walk on it.  I put it right in front of my son's crib and by the end of the day half of it seems to have scooted under the crib.  It could probably use some kind of gripping material underneath it to keep it in place	1
B000BN7Q3U:it's_very__useful:k._lamb	My baby has used this since she was 4 months old It has a sturdy wide base..It has height adjusters...you can recline it..very secure safty belts but I do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when I buckle it thats the only thing I dislike about this highchair.  I dont find it hard to clean ..it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it's on sale ..I paid full price :(	1
B000FT7NYC:very_nice_crib_-_good_price:danielle	I'm really pleased with this crib.  The price was right and it arrived within a matter of days.  Shipping and handling costs were very low.  A few dings here and there and the directions were a little hard to follow.  Otherwise, it looks great and is very sturdy.  Great crib for the price	1
B0006H5WJ6:good_quality.:antonia_lamonica_"toni"	I just purchased this crib bedding. The quality is great. I love the thickness and the velour. Worth the money	1
B0000D9SR8:love_this!:maria_c._drees_"bigpima"	Despite some negative reviews I got this seat because I have an 8 mth and 2.5 yr old and my husband is deployed so bathtime can be very challenging. I also have a textured bathtub bottom so I knew a bathring would not work.	1
B000BUQNTG:perfect_for_an_ocd,_type_a_mom!:type_a_mom_"type_a_mom"	I highly recommend this item.  As soon as your little one can sit up on his own, this is a MUST HAVE for all moms.  It fits all shopping carts (except COSTCO, but including TARGET) as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants.  It keeps baby (and Mommy's hands) from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart.  A MUST HAVE! This is the gift I give at baby showers.  I've had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach.  Still looks good	1
B00064ATVK:works_fine_but_pretty_noisy...:new_mom_in_'06	This pump works great for occasional use and after 5 months, I still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned.  (The instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss, so hopefully that problem is avoidable.)  However, beware that the motor is very loud -- I definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet.  (When I use it, I sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn't have to hear it!)  I also recommend buying the micro-steam bags by Medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them	1
B000BU14C2:great_stroller:txatty	We took this stroller to use for our 13 month old at Disney World & it was great!!  It held the bags we needed in the park and was very easy to get on and off busses / monorail / etc.  I am very pleased with this purchase.  It was great to have it in the airport too.  The only problem we had was that the cupholder was broken off by the airline when it was gate checked, but we can get a replacement.	1
B0002AJ8OM:safe_guarding_babies_feet_and_mommies_peace_of_mind.:abbott_88	My daughter ordered this to go with The Crib Shield System. It's a nice addition to the System and looks very nice	1
B000F70US0:evenflo_titan:wendy_"wendy"	I bought this item based on safety and comfort reviews from consumer reports and I'd have to say the reviews I read about on the Titan were dead on.  My 7 month old is very long for his age and he loves the freedom this seat provides as opposed to the cramped car seat we were using.  I also like the fact that as he grows into a toddler and is able to sit forward I can still use this seat - I wish I had bought this seat from the get go	1
B0006HBRYA:britax_marathon_:a._nguyen	The size is bigger than i thought but i loved it.  My son fits in nicely	1
B000I0YYYU:good_looking_next_to_the_sink:j._r.	This product works well with my Dr Brown's bottles.  There are holes in it that make it easy to stand up the inner parts of the bottles.  Much better looking than a lot of bottle drying racks.  I use a Sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so that it won't scratch the bottles, though.  The Sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	1
B0000CGB3K:love_this_set:wray_chappel_"dadto5angels"	I have just got this bed set 5 days ago and love it! It could be used for a girl or boy. I have looked around for bedding for a portable crib and could not find anything I liked and they seemed high in price, well then I found this one and it's fits perfect on a portable crib. And it's alot cuter than the picture! I really do like it. The only thing is I wish it had a dust ruffel :	1
B000G0KQWQ:truly,_truly_a_miracle:c._pace	Our son has an especially strong startle reflex, and has to be swaddled to sleep, at all.  At 2.5 weeks, he startled being able to get out of any swaddle we did, no matter how expertly done, no matter what blanket we used.  So, at 1 hour of sleep, he'd start crying and we'd have to go in and start all over.  We searched online for actual "Swaddling" blankets and based on reviews, chose this one.  WHAT AN UTTER MIRACLE. We are in such debt to the dad who created this!  Our son is now 12 weeks old, and we use this for each nap and for nighttime sleep.  He was sleeping 6-7 hour stretches at 5 weeks, and slept 11 hours at 8 weeks.  We would never have this success without this blanket.  We've periodically tried to get him to sleep without it, but his reflex is STILL so strong that he needs it.  It took a little "getting used to" the method to get him wrapped up, but in no time we both were experts.  And the price on Amazon, with free shipping, is way better than what we paid directly through AMB.  I wholeheartedly reccommend this to all parents, especially new parents.	1
B00005BUB0:nice_stool:ak_princess_"scrapmom"	I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training.  I like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet.  She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty, it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training	1
B000056JA2:finally,_peace_of_mind!:n._calabrese	I bought this portable tent for my Graco Pack N Play because my toddler can climb out of it and I wanted him to be safe. We use this when visiting friends and relatives and it provides me with 100% peace of mind knowing that he won't be able to escape and injure himself. It is easy to attach to the portable crib and holds very securely. My only negative comment is that it's a little difficult to put together- I usually keep it assembled and throw it in my trunk to save time and my sanity.	1
B000067PRC:give_me_a_break...:c._bartels_"americanbaby_de"	A great success. I love all Kiddapotamus products, that I bought so far because they are well-done, thoughtful and win awards all the time - but best of all, they are really very handy.	1
B0001384PY:perfect_rug:l._k._crews	I agree with the above reviewers. This rug is large and very well made. Perfect in any little girl's room	1
B000056JIH:for_me_it_was_a_must-have:e._b._glass	Before my daughter was born, I knew I was determined to breastfeed her.  I read several books and asked a lot of moms what their breastfeeding must-haves were.  Several people mentioned this nursing stool.  I was doubtful about how helpful a little stool could actually be, but I also wanted every resource possible available to help my breastfeeding relationship go smoothly, so I went ahead and bought it.  In the weeks prior to my daughter's birth, my husband assembled the stool and I would use it to prop up my aching feet after a long day at work.  After my baby was born, I set up a little nursing station in my living room, and I found the stool to be an essential item.  Basically it lifted my knees to just the right angle to help prop the baby in the correct position.  I also used a nursing pillow, and between the pillow and the stool, the whole experience was actually very comfortable.  I was able to nurse for long periods of time without feeling any pain or stress from holding the baby in the right position.  I am definitely holding on to this item for use with future babies, and I would recommend it to any new mom who plans to nurse her baby	1
B000BM4OFE:works_good_for_us:winnie	This gate has some good points and just one negative.	1
B000F6SQXM:the_cover:t._smith_"tas01"	I have to say this is a better made one than some of the others. My mom purchased this to have in her car in case our daughter is with her. How the cover is designed to fit over the base some of the straps are almost impossible to reach underneath and where it is to be attached.  I had to end up using needlenose pliers to pull the strap thru.	1

I DO wish Jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  Very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard	0

171809	I would absolutley love this product if it came with an apllicator brush instead of a roller ball. The roller ball hardly lets any of the gloss come out, and you find yourself rolling it over & over again to get a decent amount of gloss. The gloss itself is pretty(once you get enough on your lips.) And it does taste & smell delicious. But it is way too much trouble with the roller ball. I would suggest they make this with an applicator brush. It would make a great product	0
204264	I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red	0
221226	I bought this product at Sephora.  I had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  When I tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  I took it back to Sephora for an exchange since I was still within the 30 day exchange period.  The second one worked for about two months...then the SAME thing happened.  I was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  This product is horrible.  I never dropped it or anything like that.  In fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, I would place it back in the box it came in.  I am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  Honestly, I wanted a good flat iron and I thought this was a good product because it was expensive...BIG MISTAKE.  My friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  She also straightens her hair a lot more often than I do.  I don't know why I didn't ask her where she got hers.  Please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  If you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.	0

420217	Watching the show I thought that Jonathan really cared about hair and its no doubt that he does still but his shampoo leaves alot to be desired. For example, even in the hot, very humid atmosphere of Houston, TX it left my hair feeling dry and unhealthy, even after using his conditioner (alot of it). My hair looks awful after using it. And the bottle claims that it doesn't use toxic ingredients like MEA but it DOES use three different types of PEG, a petroleum based thicker found in most bath products that can erode wooden tables in just minutes. This is just as harmful as MEA, especially for people with sensitive scalps and hair. And it claims not to strip your hair but the products that are supposed to cleanse are much less apparent in the product than the PEG products. Since PEG is a thickener, you're also getting a diluted, toxic, solution. Even though Head and shoulders uses MEA I find that that even that works better than this. My hair doesn't feel like it has any more of its essential oils and I've switched back to the other hair products Iv'e been using. It's not worth your 20 dollars, its barely worth 5 dollars. My hair stylist also recommended Dove products if you need hydration. DON'T BUY IT!	0
436889	This product totally frizzed out my hair. I had been having good luck for once with Paul Mitchell's foaming mousse. This Jonathan product,sadly, rather than taming my hair, induced the frizz. A lot. Perhaps a stronger formula is needed, or maybe I just don't have fine, limp enough hair I was very sad	0
463010	After the debacle that was Dirt I tried to repair the damage by making my now filthy looking hair shiny.  Well now my hair was not only dirty it was shiny and dirty.  Is this a joke.  I am sure that Jonathan was not trying to deceive people by charging such exorbitant prices for a hair cut if he was not a man of substance and yet here I am trying to wash this out of my hair, with his very shampoo and all I have is tears. Clearly this is not Product Without Tears.	0
481898	this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  It did straighten my hair, but that was all.  I had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this T3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.	0
527584	I have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. I bought the T3 Tourmaline with great excitement. Come on - its 200$, the most I have ever used on a hairdryer. I did NOT reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..But all in all- too much money for too little help!	0
534591	After using this product, I felt less than fresh.  Then I realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  I would have been better off using a can of Evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money	0

B000ALBLXO:one_of_the_most_horrible_products_i've_ever_used:the_rain	Never had I been so unhappy with my makeup as I was when I was using Clinique. I used Stay Beige (which I lightly patted on my face on top of Clinique's superfit liquid makeup - I have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. I also hated how Clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that I had to settle for Honey in the liquid and Beige in the powder. As much as I went back to Macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. Either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced I was making a big deal out of nothing. Instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which I shouldn't have to do in the first place) I just switched to a different makeup line: Laura Mercier, which I am VERY happy with.	0

I buy Prevage MD (which is double the strength of regular Prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and I only pay 120$.  Why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?

B000265BPQ:too_expensive,_but_good:b._donovan	I used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when I wasn't going out (clear).  I like the product: how it looks and smoothes out my lips, but I just cannot afford to pay $60 a month on my lips!  If they lower the price by $10-12, I will buy it again......but not until they do :-	0
B0002XVFUE:smell_changes_from_great_to_horrid:metal27	At first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache.  I cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant.  I cannot detect vanilla in this at all.	0
B0002A65O8:overpriced_soap!:victoria_stewart_"vicki"	I bought this soap just to see what all the Philosophy hype is all about. I was not impressed. It smells just like ordinary soap-so what? The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. You can get soap that smells better at Wal-Mart!	0
B00021C1J0:serious_smell_too:gerene_y._keesler_"shop_princess"	As much as I LOVE Fat Girl Slim, I thought I'd try Serious Cellulite soap to go with it. I was not impressed at all. It has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap. It was what I thought it would be at all. The size of the bar was good, the price is good, but I am not pleased at all with the quality	0
B00029KWQG:not_a_good_shade.:lauren_henkelman	I love, love, love, Lipglass normally.  But this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.	0
B00064A5L4:scent_shortlived:nicole_g.	I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, I love it.  But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  Really really disapointed.  I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines.  They are quality and can last most of the day.  This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days.	0
B000AYS2P6:not_impressed_at_all...:elainereads_"elainereads"	After hearing Oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her Favorite Things for 2005, I thought for sure I'd love it.  I ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  I just had to see for myself...	0

B000ALY3Z2:it_just_doesn't_work...._:(:m._rizvi_"i_love_shopping"	i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market	0
B00024XXW6:horrible:the_rain	Although it is great others love this product, I did not get that same streak of good luck. I had been using Clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people I knew used it. However, every time I took pictures I couldn't help but cringe after I saw the way my face looked. I'm a naturally tan person, but when I wore Clinique's foundation (I used Honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. It got to the point where I got so upset that I went back to the Clinique counter at Macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. They insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though I had gone back a couple different times.	0
B00021DHSE:not_worth_it:beauty_czar	I have been using Frederic Fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so I thought I would try the luscious curls.  It was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  It left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  When it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  I have used Loreal's Professional line prior to this and I will definitely go back to it.  It's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.	0
B000MQEI8C:just_ok.:s.swan	Doesn't really change appearance of eye area. I'm 37 and am starting to get some lines,puffiness and circles, but used product 3weeks and wasn't impressed	0
B000CCUXD0:don't_waste_your_money:francesca	This doesn't work. First time I tried it, it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more. So I tried it again...and again...and again....I've given up on it. It totally doesn't work	0
B00021DSB0:too_expensive:angela_braden_"amour_rellement"	The texture of this product is fine, but not really better than anything you can get at the drugstore, therefore overpriced.	0
B00014GE32:moisturizing,_but_that_is_about_it.:nobadges	I used the entire tube faithfully as a face cream over the course of several months. While I thought it moisturized fine, I did not notice any change in my lines, tone, texture. For the money I'd go get several tubes of the Neutrogena anti-aging products - they work better, have a nicer texture and smell MUCH better.	0

B0007TJOD8:disappointing....:m._farmer_"jane"	i was soooo excited to get this in the mail.  i have very oily skin.  the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne.  i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed.  the shipping is insanely high.  i will stick to MAC skincare from now on	0
B000ALDK24:i_give_up...:m._farmer_"jane"	i don't know why i keep giving clinique a chance.  i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier.  if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away, try clean & clear for oily skin. it's better and cheaper	0
B0007GAZBQ:not_perfect:elizabeth_a._borst	This product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. The point of it was lost on me. It may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. In fact when I touched my face I could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. It has a dry, heavy feeling to it. Don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. I thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. I now use Laura Mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. I didn't like the formulation of Philosophy's product at all	0

B00022603W:deceptive_advertising:c._m._ellett_"workaholic"	I am dissatisfied with Lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  I encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in Lush's products.  I have yet to see a Lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  There are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently	0
B0002MJCDM:not_flawless,_but_it_covers.:danielle_cappelletti	If you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  It takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  While it does cover completely, it is not flawless. You can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.  If it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit	0
B00068O73M:"yawn":jane_doe	Did not care for this one really, it is better as a body wash	0
B0002F1SBI:i_didn't_really_like_this_soap:	This soap washed really well, but after I rinsed it off, it felt like my skin had a soapy film over it. It also made my skin feel "stipped". I did not really like this soap and instead recommend Basis facial products instead	0
B0007TG4JK:not_worth_the_money:karen_erikson_"the_pony_rescuer"	I purchased this shampoo for my daughter after she read rave reviews in a teen magazine.  She has thick, blonde hair and it was dry from summer heat, pool water, and light styling.  After trying the rehab shampoo, she was so disappointed that it did nothing to help her hair.  She said that while it lathered nicely, it felt like it stripped her hair and when it rinsed out, it left her hair overly 'squeeky' and tangled.  The end result once her hair was dried (after using conditioner, too), was that it was a lighter shade of blonde, very fly-away, and dry feeling.  She was hoping for smoother, easier to manage hair.  We debated purchasing this shampoo because of its high cost, and I have to say we are extremely disappointed.  The claims were hype, and the results were not delivered.  Her hair was by no means 'fried' or severely damaged, so I fully expected her to have some more manageable locks after using the product, based on its claims.  I will say that I bought her a shampoo and condition at the drug store that has helped dramatically.  It is Thermasilk Smooth & Silky line, and it works wonders over Rehab for a fraction of the cost.  Save your money on this one	0

B0007LXKQS:weighed_my_hair_down_:g._graham_"g"	I bought the ultra hydrating shampoo, conditioner, and the treatment, oh and also the hairspray.  These products dried my hair out horribly and weighed it down.  I gave it 2 weeks because it was so expensive and after two weeks my hair never has looked any worse!  I have naturally wavy, thick coarse hair and this made my hair unmanageable - like a helmet head.  My hair had no movement, no shine--just made it very heavy and weighed down.  Last night I used a hair purifier shampoo that gets gunk, minerals, etc out of your hair and after that I deep conditioned it with Kerestase Masintense - wow, what a difference!!  Afer blowdrying my hair it was soft, shiny and had so much bounce!  I woke up this morning and my hair was still awesome.  So glad to have my old hair back - I was beginning to think I had a hormone problem or water problem but it was this Ojon product - horrible if you have the type of hair I have.  Good Luck	0
B00021DAGI:not_worth_all_the_fuss:lily_wei_"augie"	I am asian and I have very thick and coarse hair. I bought this product due to all the rave but it did nothing for me, and it doesn't even smell nice. After trying numerous products and flat irons, I had Thermal Reconditioning done - my hair has never been smoother, silkier and so easily manageable. No product or styling necessary, just wash and go	0
B000225ZVA:smells_nice,_but_not_worth_it...._unless....:s._eddy_"seddy"	I love the scent of this bathbomb, but the clean up is annoying. Noone wants to take a nice bath and then have to get out the tub cleaner afterwards.	0
B000FV69MW:too_sticky:professional_shopper	I love the Cinnamon Buns shower gel, so I thought I would try the lip gloss. For one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like Cinnamon buns. I don't know what the flavor is, but I don't like it. Maybe they have added almond or something. Secondly, it's way too sticky. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips. It reminds me of vaseline. Since I got this product in a kit, I cannot return it, but I will not be using it again	0
B0006NF894:very_disappointed:d._young	I have been on a search for the perfect mascara for many years now, just as many of the reviewers had been.  I purchased this mascara based on the reviews and I am more than disappointed in the mascara.  I would not give you 2 cents for the product and would love to return it.  The mascara is clumpy and will not stick to the eyelash.  I do not mind paying $25.00 for a tube of mascara if it doe's the job, this one doe's not.  I had better luck with Max Factor, Clinque, etc.	0
B00021B9O8:so-so_eyeshadow:julie_a._adkins_"wildfire68"	The eyeshadow isn't bad, nice color, but the packaging was a disappointment. The brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can't get very much onto the brush. There is no way to open the casing either, so its pretty useless. I found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also.	0
B00029KWMA:not_a_good_shade.:lauren_henkelman	I love, love, love, Lipglass normally.  But this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.	0
B00021D8I8:not_so_great....:shopper_"shopper"	The company/shipping was fine.  No beefs there.  The product itself I find to be rather damaging to the skin.  In order to extract, you have to press down EXTREMLY hard, (If you can even locate what your attempting to extract w/that darn pin hole at the end.)  I can't imagine this wouldn't leave scars.  I wouldn't reccomend this product. I just put it in the drawer, never to be used again.  :	0
B0002O38NK:not_worth_the_packaging:gina_nichols_"beauty_first"	i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  I used the entire container and saw no benefit!!	0

B00021CFPK:even_with_multiple_strokes,_the_silver_glitter_is_nearly_invisible.:ann_i._elation	What's the point of this mascara when half the container doesn't do what it's supposed to do? The black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. Part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. And the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.	0
B0002DO4G6:this_is_not_the_real_thing_-_it_is_a_copy:v._mccausland	I work in the cosmetics industry - BEWARE THIS IS A COPY - NOT A REAL MAC LIPSTICK ! Not even close to the formula or color of "Moxie".	0

B00014GTTG:cakey_and_gross:e._tidwell	This item was fine when it came to pictures; tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding. However I was told by a few of the guests that it looked like I had been in a fight before the wedding... make-up should not look like bruises!	0
B00021ARA0:not_long_lasting_enough:jonathan_wegener_"technosnob"	This was my first cologne purchase.  It's a really delicious scent -- complex and pleasant, not overpowering.  Give it 15 min to dry and mix with your skin.  It truly does smell different from the first spray.  I can't stop smelling myself...I really love the smell.	0
B000F8JKDU:good_intentions_but_odd:mjp_rhonegal63	i bought this for travel/gym bag use. When it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed. The frangrace was very masculine smelling. i guess this is the Yerba Mate aroma which is very earthy smelling	0
B000235UQY:no_thank_you:1sassylady	I bought this stuff because I heard it helped with razor burn. My husband likes me to shave a bit more often than I liked, well, too bad for him!! The pain from putting this stuff on was WAY WORSE than any sort of razor burn! No thanks!	0
B000F6K0RC:hard_to_remove:anonymous	This mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  I used Lancome's Bi-Facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  I lost quite a few lashes in the process.  I would recommend buying the regular Definicils, not the waterproof	0

B000E1336S:lasted_only_1_hour:p._wallace_"surf_safari"	I bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but I believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. However, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. The wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. The return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. Waste of money, don't buy one	0
B00021B3SA:terrible_brush:carrie_bradshaw	This brush was not as firm as expected.  I expected greater quality from the Sephora brand.  However, the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to "finer" brushes.  So in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more	0
B000EQ9LOG:don't_buy!:mmhknitting	This shampoo is so bad that I thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake. It is watery and does not lather. My hair felt like it hadn't been washed for days, and the next day I had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film. I never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting $10.00	0
B000225ZTW:it's_just_ok:blryan1973	The shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  The product goes on like Lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  Then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  Overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what I expected or wanted.  I was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.	0
B0007LXKQ8:don't_waste_your_money:j.s.l.w.	This product was such a waste. The little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow-drying the hair. I will not repurchase it.	0
B000BLGVBK:don't__bother:a._lansdowne_"allie2386"	Falling in Love is one of my favorite scents ever.  It's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  If you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  That's why I was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  Let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. When I opened the seal and held it under my nose I could hardly smell it.  When I applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  I rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  I expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  Very disappointing.	0

It goes on to imply that you will see a result every time you use it - it's not one of these products where you need to use it repeatedly to see results.  I bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  Now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.	0
B00068O764:-:b._donlon_"brooke"	i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin	0

B0002260HS:try_another_lush_soap_v.2.0:e._e._jacquot_"lip_gloss_junkie"	I generally love Lush soaps, but do not recommend this one. Demon in the Dark has a great name, but it doesn't smell very good (a sort of faint, slightly minty scent). It also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off, but must be removed for the soap to work properly.  I would try Red Rooster or Karma soap instead	0
B0002A65MA:rashy_buns!:annette_disalvo	I received this as a Christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  After my second time using it, I broke out in a terrible itchy rash. There is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  Do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  The smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower.	0

B00021DD5G:don't_bother:victoria	At first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results	0
B00021D252:informercials....too_good_to_be_true!:j._huynh_"youngjeezy"	I've ordered this product a month ago.  I had mild acne, I've used a lot of Benzoyl Peroxide products etc persagel, Clearasil, etc.  One day I saw a commerical for this Murad product, which looked too good to be true.  I've ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had "real people" saying the product worked.  I did follow the instructions on the 3 products.  Less than a week, my face broke out even more, I had some cystic acne which I never had before.  It was astonishing, but the company said there was a "purging" state, which I held out hope that it would be a minor setback.  2 weeks later, again I started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area.  I am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month.  It's been 1 month and 3 weeks and I am so disappointed.  I've stop using this product for the last 3 days and my skin is getting better and I've cancelled any future products from this company.  DON'T RECOMMEND IT	0
11510	If Jonathan wants to sell environmentally concious products he should promote it in his other hairstyling products. The aquasana shower filter  is an excellent product which i use .Whats it matter who's name is on it. It is what it is and it will leave your skin and hair feeling fresher.	1
51798	Very picky about shampoo and this a really good for dry color treated hair.  I can tell it has made a difference	1
96250	I have been reading about this miracle hair dryer for months in the beauty magazines I read, so I will admit I was very excited to pruchase it. The results however will amaze even the most cynical consumer. My hair has never looked so good when styled at home. True, it looks about the same as what my hairstylist does, but to me that is well worth the moderately high price tag. It was a good buy for me because I spend a lot of money buying a variety of cremes and glosses to make my hair pretty, and now I know it wasn't the products I put in that made my hair look bad, it was the dryer.I was so surprised to notice that even the ends of my hair were shiny, and my ends are sooo fried. The difference is astounding.	1

209111	High Beam is a nice subtle highlighter. However, be sure to blend it very quickly and well or it will look unnatural in certain lighting (it'll look like you have pink nail polish on your face). It also has a tendency to emphasize pores. So only use it on areas of your face where you don't have any, like on the top of the cheek bone and under your eyebrows.	1
319143	I watched Blow Out and figured the product was flying off the shelves because of the show's popularity.  I ordered some because the ingredients sounded nice, plus he did seem sincere when formulating, etc.  I have blonde hair, color treated, thick, long lengths.  I've bought high-end hair products for 20 yrs from beauty salons and stores and have never used anything that made my hair feel like Jonathan Product.  You can immediately tell it's stripping and cleansing your hair.  Then, the conditioner,  with it's exotic fragrance,  is the most wonderful conditioning treatment I've ever used.  My hair looks cleaner and has more body than ever before with just shampoo & conditioner.  I'll use it as long as it's available to me	1
420216	Well I am very impressed with this.  I also have tried so many different shampoos and this is one of the best, if not the best, I've used.  I say that because whether I straighten my hair or leave it curly, this shampoo makes it feel and look and smell great.  It feels so nice and clean.  I don't rinse twice with this because it's unnessesary.	1
445940	I had the Chi Turbo (1"), but I got worried after reading some reviews about it being unreliable.  So part of the reason I wanted to buy the T3 iron was that it comes with a 4-YEAR comprehensive warranty.  The other difference is that the solid-ceramic plates are "infused" with tourmaline which I found intriguing.	1
481899	This dry iron is absolutely amazing, I really can't say enough about it. Great for ALL TYPES of hair! It heats up in just seconds and what would take almost 2hrs to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time. Plus your hair comes out extremely straight. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours. It is an investment in your hair, one of the better ones I've made.	1
520963	I just had my fine, processed hair cut into a short layered wedge.  It was shoulder length before and I used a Revlon thermal-air styler to make it acceptable.  After using Dirt, I no longer have to spend ANY time styling it!!  I just blow dry, scrunching my hair with my fingers and when almost dry, I turn my head upside-down and apply about a dime size amount of Dirt into the roots. Flip up and I'm ready to go all in less than 3 minutes.  I find it important to rub Dirt between my palms to warm it up before applying.  Use a little first...you can always add more. It gave my hair great body and control. Hope this product works for you too	1
534589	This is a great idea for a product! For those of you who don't wash your hair every day, this is a great way to keep it looking and smelling fresh on days you don't wash it. I used this after 5 days without washing, and while it might have worked better within 3 or 4 days, it still freshened my hair and made it beautiful! Well done	1
B00020NY7Y:velvety_smooth_eyes:n._kunavatana_"shola"	I couldn't say if this diminished wrinkles or puffyness, but it's fab for great feeling eyes, the whole area is velvety smooth and skin feels as soft as silk	1
B000NUGN12:relastin_really_works!!:sholeh_gregory_"sholeh_gregory"	I have always used, what I thought, the best skin products. But after using Relastin for only a few weeks, I was pleasantly surprised to see how amazingly this product has revitalized my skin! At this point I am sold out to Relastin and will only use this product	1
B00064LO3C:don't_judge_it_because_of_britney:discodan	Obviously some people don't care about reviewing an item, just about bashing a pop artist that doesn't deserve it.	1
B00023IY2Q:my_signature_fragrance!!!:ms._s._corvalan_"susie"	I have always loved happy, but I love my happy heart!  I wear it 99% of the time.  My guy loves the smell too...and I often get comments that it smells wonderful.  Not too strong, just enough.  :)  I'd recommend this perfume to everyone, young and old.	1
B0007WOQOM:dissappointing!_2_stars,_if_i_could_change_the_scale_of_stars.:ivi	I love the idea that this is an all natural mascara + has organic ingredients but nothing artifical or chemicals!!  This is the tipe of mascara which lengthens the lashes not volumises it (I think Dr. Hauschka doesn't make that kind). When it's time to wash it off it comes off very easy (spares your lashes).	1
B000ALBLXO:love_this_powder:s.w.	This powder is great. It has great coverage without looking cakey. I also have sensitive skin and this has never bothered me. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's still a little dark for very light skin and it needs to be "touched-up" a little more often than other powders I've tried, but it's worth it	1
B000KKC666:love_it:brooke_rangel	I want one in every color. It glides on very smooth and the color lasts	1
B00081UPLA:fabulous_item:texellence_"texellence"	Well worth the money, and considered on the the most timeless and staple classics for your makeup bag	1
B000B7KCS2:this_is_an_absolutey_wonerful_fragrance:d._scybert		1
B000EQDKIO:great_conditioning_hairdress:a_book_lover	This product will not work for everyone. It's not really for people with straight, fine hair.  It's formulated to target mostly women of color who have tightly curled, thick, natural hair.  I apply about a nickle-size of this stuff to the ends of my hair before I style it. It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and conditioned - eliminating breakage so that it can grow long and healthy. The aroma is a little too earthy for my personal taste, but I can handle that as long as the natural ingredients work. I give it 5 stars	1
B00021BSZ8:murad_is_a_miracle:carey_"cherrycarey"	I know it sounds cliche, but I have literally tried every acne product both over the counter and prescription. Such products include (but are not limited to) Proactiv, Exposed Skin Care, Differin, Accutane, Neutrogena products, Clean and Clear, etc. I have never had results like this. I previously tried the Murad Acne Complex and found it to be a little too harsh for my red, irritated, sensitive skin. I currently switched to the sensitive line for the Murad Acne Complex which consists of this cleanser, Moisturizing Acne Treatment Gel and the Cellular Replenishing Serum. I have found that my cistic acne is gone, the blotchiness is reduced and the number of whiteheads has drastically reduced. My skin has never looked so smooth in all my pre-teen and young adult life and I have only been using this particular line for 4 days! In addition to the sensitive Acne complex, I would also recommend getting the Clarifying Toner. And remember, a little goes a long way with these products!	1
B000EQBJKK:i_love_it:missy	My significate other bought the shampoo for me, I use the hair butter and various other products from Carol's Daughter.  I was very fortune to actually make it to the store in New York. I have very short barber-style hair and the scent drives people wild. I will continue to buy these products; if you like the fruity-tuttie smells and your hair grease non petroleum based, Carol's Daughter is for you	1
B00068O74G:love_this_scent!:c._sabala	I absolutely love this scent. I originally got the perfume and the 3 in 1 as a gift set and loved it so much I bought the lotion. The scent is a very light sort of cotton candy smell. I have a huge sweet tooth and just love the sweet smells. If you like cotton candy or a sugary smell then you'll love this	1
B00068O7LE:everyone_is_falling_in_love_with_me!:beach_bunny_beauty	I was afraid of this fragrance in the bottle, since it smelled like carmelized sugar to me. I tried the shower gel first, loved it, had to try the perfume.  Everyone loves it! My friend even asked if she could copy me and wear it too! Of course I said yes, everyone needs a little love!  We both agree to spritz a little extra on if you want others to smell it, it goes on very light. An extra spritz is not obnoxious with this scent	1
B000NGRJB4:feels_great:melissa_b_"melissa_b"	This product really does feel like silk....Out of all the eye products, I really like this one.  I would recommend it!	1
B0002260NC:make_my_hair_soft_and_shiny:hasra_niena_"hasra_ni3na"	I love this shampoo. It make my hair so soft and shiny. I cut the shampoo in four, and use it every other day. Then I keep it at dry place. This shampoo last long too. The smell is great too. Love it! I'm going to buy it for my mom	1
B0007M0N9O:best_hair_treatment_ever:cheery_you_"henx"	I have: long, thick, fine hair that is naturally wavy.  I don't color my hair but I do get frizzies and split ends, and some dryness.  I tried this product out after receiving a small sample with a [...] order, and fell in love with it.  I -love- the smell, and was surprised that other people didn't seem to.  I vastly prefer it to some of the faker, more chemical smells that a lot of shampoos seem to use.	1
B000HGFGQ0:great_product:lynelle_m._chaba	Everything was great about this from the product to the promptness which it was received.	1
B00063MTXW:very_good,_but_not_quite_great:s._paterson_"miss_ney_ney"	This eyeliner really matches the description, it goes on super smooth and doesn't tug or drag.  I was told at the counter that it was "water resistant" but it's really not.  I used to wear it under my lower eyelashes, but by the end of the day, it would be totally smudged and gross.  I would even try to put powder over it, but to no avail.  However, in defense of Laura, I am over 40 and the fine lines below my eyes aren't friendly to many pencil eye liners.  I was just hoping against hope that Laura's would be different!  So, now I only use it over the upper lid	1
B000FV98S4:pleased...:e._cole	I bought this 3 in 1 for my fiance' because he loves banana stuff.  We were both very pleased with it.  It does smell just like bananas.  I'm hoping philosophy will come out with a body souflee in the scent soon	1
B000FWAHVA:a_very_different_mascara-i_love_it!!!:sammy_madison	I changed this review from when I first wrote it a couple of weeks ago.  When I first wrote it, the title was "I like it".  Now I've changed it to "I love it!!!" because the more I use it, the more sure I am that I will not EVER buy regular mascara again.  This mascara will NOT smudge!  It will not leave "racoon eyes" under your lash line.  It goes on where you put it and stays there until you take it off.  It also does not irritate my eyes.  I never thought I would find a mascara that didn't make me want to rub and rub my eyes.  I hate rubbing my eyes because I know it makes them baggy and makes wrinkles.  I have been seeing mascara which forms a tube around the lash advertised in high-end catalogs lately, and have been intrigued.  When I found out Philosophy, a brand I really respect, had this type of mascara available, I had to order it right away.  As soon as the UPS man brought it, I applied it.  It makes your lashes look really long!  They have a lot of individual definition, and show up as very distinct.  This mascara doesn't "fatten" the lashes, but it lengthens them so much, and it is a much cleaner look than the lash thickening mascara I have been using.  I really like the look, and the mascara does not smudge, or rinse off easily in water.  It seems to stay on really well, without the clumpy, greasy feeling I get from waterproof mascara.  It comes off neatly in little chunks when you rub a little "Purity Made Simple" cleanser on it.  I really like this mascara, and I will buy it again.  Actually I am going to throw out all my other kinds of mascara and only get this kind	1
B0009PLDY8:badger_hair__brush:m._sobczak	I purchased this item for my boyfriend and he loves it. It is a great lower end badger hair brush. It also conveniently transforms as a metal cylinder for easy travel	1
B0002ZOF36:healthy_looking_skin_and_less_dark_spots:prof_pd_rivers	To be totally honest, I'm not entirely sure what these ingredients are all about, but I do know one thing: this stuff really works! After using this for a couple of weeks, I started noticing a visible change in the small dark spots on my face. It wasn't dramatic, but I kept using the Repair Formula, and about a month later, I could definitely see a difference! People have commented on the way I look, and I recommend it to all of them. It just makes your skin look healthier.	1
B000225ZJM:it_really_is_dreamy.:jocelyn_neveaux_"psyche_knot"	What I really like about this product is that little goes a long, long way.	1
B0006G36YK:i_was_surprised:s._lew	I received a coupon for a free sample of the Kinerase C6 Peptide in a magazine. It said it was a thirty dollar value, it was .25 oz and I was surprised at how small thirty dollars was! But what the heck it was free. Well it has lasted over three weeks so far using it once to twice a day and it actually seems to work! My complexion is brighter I have less adult acne, a constant problem, and I just feel my face looks better. I've been ill for a few months and my face was looking bad, I think so anyway. I'm one of those people who look ten years younger than my age but I certainly wasn't lately. All I can say is it works very well for me so much so that I'm probably going to invest the 96.00 to buy the 1 oz, I figure it's worth it and will last about three months.	1
B000M86GAI:great_lipstick:mike_mcguire_"dani_mcguire"	This is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from CARGO. I would very much recommend it. The lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin. The four stars are because I love smelly things... and this one just smells like lipstick.  It could smell yummier I suppose. But so far, I love it	1
B000N3Y9KQ:perfectness_to_the_extreme:b._horakh_"bath_bubbler"	I just love this product I felt like I was sitting on top of a cloud. I definately am going to by this again	1

B000HGFDX6:wonderful_product:k._breaux	This Vitamin E moisture cream has a great soft rosey smell, and feels great on my skin. I was given a sample which I took home and tried, and I was blown away by this product. I went back to our local mall a few days later and purchased the product. I love it	1

B000970B0I:awesome_coverage:cheryl_havanac	This is one of the most perfect concealers I have ever used. It goes on nice and creamy (does not pull on your skin when applying) and covers those imperfections.  You also do not need a lot of product to get the job done.  The colors are very natural and I have found a perfect color in Sand for me. I will buy this product again.	1
B000M596U8:a_perfectly_natural_look:nancy_p.	I bought this along with the "Some Kind of Gorgeous" foundation faker.  I don't have the best skin, (oily), but like a more natural look.  These two product together are so great.  I look natural, but healthier.  And my skin stays less shiny all day.  I use the other side of the foundation sponge to apply it	1
B000CDNW46:wonderful_smell_and_great_product:sarah_borkowski	I pulled the lid of the Philosphy Vanilla Birthday Cake bottle and inhaled the wonderful smell of vanilla birthday cake.  It smells 100% like its glorious namesake.  While some people complain about feeling strange bathing in birthday cake or a strawberry milkshake, I think of it as being just another type of aromatherapy.  Cake makes me happy, birthdays make me happy, this birthday cake smelling body wash and shampoo really makes me happy!	1
B000C49RXA:here's_the_truth..._it_works...:m._rodriguez	Hi, I just wanted to let everyone out their know: that this stuff works.	1
B000FH65DE:a_staple_scent:nikita_jolie	This one could appeal to a variety of fragrance lovers as it seems to find that middle ground in preferences. It's not too spicy, not sickeningly sweet. It's not trying to do too much. Just effortless. One thing I like about this, you're not at risk at dousing yourself and offending other noses. I hate smelling or leaving a trail of perfume in the air. This one has restraint. Staying power is debatable but it's such a wonderful, confident woman scent, I gave it 5 stars	1
B0006DS3KU:smell_washes_out:misskris28	i've been using ojon for a year or so, and my hair has never been healthier.  i have long, fine, wavy hair which i flat iron about 5 times a week; this product definitely keeps your hair shiny and protected from heat damge and split ends.  hair stylists are always amazed at the great condition my hair is in being that i heat treat it so often, and i get comments all the time from friends, family, and just people i encounter about how shiny and pretty my hair looks.  the smell is distinctive (not offensive in my opinion), but you wash the product out out!  my hair smells like my shampoo/conditioner, so i really don't understand what the other posts about the smell are trying to say.  i definitely reccomend this product and do so often.	1
B000BIPK4C:no_more_eyeshadow_creases!:lynn_s	This is a life-changing product if you have any issues with eye shadow creasing.  You just smooth a little of this product on your eyelids before applying eye shadow, and it provides a perfect base.  Twelve hours later, the shadow is still perfectly in place.  I bought this at a Neiman Marcus store, but the product is so good I wanted to make sure I rated it online so others would know how great it is!	1
B00021DHSE:awesome_curl_enhancer!:s._newnham	I love this light curing lotion! It smells like orange/vanilla creamsicle. It enhances the curls in my naturally curly hair, makes it more moisturized, and smells great! It has no hold, so if you need hold you'll need to use a gel over it. Love it, and worth the $s	1
B00021DE6E:mmmm,_dreamy_nights.:afaf_bouardi_"hair_and_glamor_product_aficionado"	I first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure.  It got me curious, as they rarely do.  Passing Sephora, I went in for a test...and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent.  It seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo.  After a few days, I still couldn't get the scent out of my head so I went back to grab it up.  I've only had this experience with a few other fragrences...but they were of a totally different style...Angel by Thierry Mugler and Flower by Kenzo	1
B000MUZA1W:plump_those_lips:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	Feel sexy and tingly without the burn of most lip plumping products.  Your lips will be glossy, shiny and soft when you use this product	1
B000B9NA8O:great_poduct,_great_smell:ptitange98_"laura."	Very good product and great kind of fruity smell. leave hair soft and full of "bounce". Easy to comb hair after using this product but might be combine with Kerastase conditionner for very dry and damage hair if your hair are very long. The price here is still more expensive than in Europe: around 22 euros	1
B000B6A2E2:the_most_incredible_cream_out_there_:-):little_miss_cutey	Let me say that this is the best skin care cream I have ever used and I know for a fact that it works because so many dermatologists stand behind it.	1
B000AXZZWU:i_love_this_stuff:ruby_s	I'm nearly forty and I'm not going to give in to cellulite and wrinkles without a fight. I got this cream, and have been using it along with MBT trainer shoes and the occasional workout on an eliptical trainer. After one month, I'm starting to see results in the smoothness of my previously-lumpy legs. I can't say that it would work wonders alone, but as an add-on to an exercise program, it seems to be helping quite a lot. I've done weight-loss programs before, and they've never addressed the cellulite issue. This is the first thing that has seemed to work. And it's great moisturizer, too.	1
B000IK0DKO:best_lip_gloss_i've_ever_used!:sailormom	Brush applicator puts it exactly where I want. Gives my lips a great "wet look", without being messy. Never bleeds & lasts for hours without touch-ups. This is the only gloss I'll use	1
B000B1VU7A:can't_fly_without_it:s._holcomb_"s"	Great for flying..... keeps your skin & nose from drying out	1
B000ALBLWU:i'm_in_love:amber	I have been using this powder for about 5 years. It is amazing. I have problems with red cheeks and breakouts. Once I put on my concealer and foundation, I put on this powder and it is truly what makes my imperfections disappear. It even comes with the perfect application brush. This powder is worth every penny because it does what a powder should do	1
B000HJT1CW:i_love_this_product!:mary_madre	For over 7 years I have been battling Adult Acne Rosacea with little success.  I have used prescribed creams, facialists, OTC products, diet changes, etc. with minimal effects.  With the onset of winter I wanted to ensure my face was moisturized with the very low humidity.  While ordering a mister from Amazon, I noticed many people also ordered the Body Shop Vitamin E Face Mist.  I thought "why not"?  The results were almost immediate! The redness and breakouts have greatly diminished and I'm once again getting comments from people on how very nice my skin is looking.  You couldn't ask for an easier application and it doesn't give my skin a claustraphobic feeling.  And, the rose water scent is revitalizing and calming.  This is the best thing I've used in over 6 years.  I wholeheartedly recommend it, especially to premenopausal women  who are experiencing skin dryness	1
B000ALBLX4:best_pressed_powder_i_have_ever_used:n._bruske	I wear Stay Neutral and have been using this product for years.  Doesn't clog pors and it looks flawless.  This is a really great product and work the $18.00	1
B00021BUKQ:sweet_treat!:j._shake_"beauty_junkie"	This is a sweet treat!  It smells good enough to eat.  It also leaves my skin smooth and soft.  It works good as a shampoo on my thick, wavy hair too.  Cinnamon Buns 3-in-1 is a wonderful product and everyone should buy it.  Totally worth the $dough$.  Ha Ha	1
B00068O7TQ:this_is_good,_but_derma_step_is_still_the_best!:susan	I had tried all kinds of skin care systems, with different levels of success, but in the end, the Derma Step system works the best, with long lasting results.

B00081UE8E:super_product:l._e._smith	Having been blessed with very large pores on my nose and cheeks I was looking for something that might help reduce the appearance of my pores.  They seem to enlarge as I age. Came across this product somewhat by accident. I was really amazed at how well it works. Just a small dollop tapped lightly on the skin and your pores vanish and your skin looks perfectly smooth. It mattifies the skin all day (and I have extra oily skin). Other Clinique products have made my skin break out, but this stuff is wonderful if you suffer from acne on your nose or cheeks. Highly recommended	1
B00021DI10:best_day_to_day...:buffyholt.com_"buffyholt.com"	I'm not a big perfume girl.  I mean, I love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique (or antique-y looking) ones.  But I generally prefer essential oils over perfume.  That said, out of the dozens that I own, I keep three on hand at all times.  (Four if you count the little mini I got from SpaceNK)	1
B000EDV8JA:smells_great!:r.p.	My boyfriend used to search online stores for the French cologne Jean Patou pour Homme because it was the only "upscale" cologne he would wear (It was awesome!). However, it is not produced anymore and is very hard to find and very expensive. He searched high and low to find a replacement, and this is it!	1
B0007TJOEC:cut_it_with_american_cream:megan_l._cousins	when I first got the package delivered to me at work, my assistant and I were smelling all the products... this one made both of us scrunch our noses in distaste. But when I got home and actually applied it to my hair, it smelled nothing like the nasty old lady smell I had detected before. The reason why I have given this product 5 stars, is because I feel that this conditioner has been unfairly graded here. The conditioner is for people with curly or processed hair -- meaning, if you have straight, thick hair, this conditioner may seem like a waste of money due to the amount of product you have to apply. Also, as us girls with curly hair know, not all curly hair is equal. Some have thick, springy curls that gets curlier the shorter the cut it, while others have a thinner quality to their hair which actually gets curlier the longer it gets. I'm the later, and I think this is why this product works for me. I can understand how this may seem misleading to those with the thicker curl types, but I'm here to set the record straight on that one. I hope it helps in deciding if this product is right for you	1
B000FEIO72:mandarin_orange_and_grapefruit:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	Olive oil moisturizes while grapefruit, lemon oil and mandarin orange oil refresh. This is a large foaming bath treat that looks like a big fizzy orange vitamin pill that you put in water. It seems to foam slowly and eventually I broke it into pieces to help the process along. It kept fizzing and foaming creating tiny orange and yellow islands within the bubbles (I added some bubble bath first - you might want to try some Happy Hippy shower gel).	1
B0007NE8F8:iman_oil_blotting_translucent_powder_medium_deep:char	This is not my first purchase from Iman cosmetics.  I love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well. I would definitely purchase this powder again	1
B000225ZZQ:pretty_in_pink_bubble_baths:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	If you love baths, but simply must have bubbles, then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak. You can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs. I keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts, which is an excuse to buy more lush products!	1
B00068O7GO:i_love_this_product!!!!:k._bingham	I bought this because I wanted a primer for make up, but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out, as some reviews have stated. Initially I did break out a little, but I kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth. After a week the breakouts went away (they were minor) and all I can say is WOW. My skin looks so much better, my make up looks better, I look better without make up, etc. etc. I use it with Complete Me powder foundation and I have never in all my 38 years been happier with a pair of products.	1
B00068O1II:good_overall_product:wylie	I received this product as a X-Mas gift this year. I really do like it, considering the last two Philosophy products I did not care for (The Gingerbread Man Bodywash and Amen Cologne). Out of the tube, it's a little thick, but you only need a thin layer to do the trick. It offers up a nice smooth shave, and my skin feels soft and moisturized afterward. Definitely a keeper..	1
B000BGWGNM:smells_good:b._e_jackson	When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend, don't tell her it was under 40 dollars!  I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume.  Yeah, like it really smells better just because it's more expensive.  Anyway, Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over.  It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either.  Add just a touch for proper use	1
B000BGWGNM:lovely_-_gorgeous,_clean,_rich,_modern:j._tucker_"rulesgirl"	I got the Gift Box.  I love it.  It smells very modern and you can layer it with a sugar or a vanilla to make your own blend.  It smells "money" - because it is so sophisticated - I love how it wears, it gets nicer as the evening goes on.  I like that in a scent.	1
B000143NLS:smaller_that_i_expected:karyn_blaney_"blaneygirl"	These are good and do the trick but it's hard to get my fingers in the holes.	1

B000B9NA2K:tangles_out,_smooth_&_shiny_in,_not_too_heavy:judi_rayner_"jkrayner"	I have frosted hair that is generally on the dry side.  The problem with most conditioners I've tried is that if they are good enough to get out the knots in my hair and soften it, they are very heavy and weigh my hair down.  I found out about Kerastase at my beauty parlor and can only get it there or at Amazon.  It's wonderful, doing everything I need, including making my hair nice and shiny, without the heaviness.  I recommend it highly	1
B00023KDBG:freshly_washed_fragrance!:artemisia	I've been wearing Philosophy's Falling in Love as a regular fragrance and liked it so much that I decided to give some of their other products a try... Pure Grace has been a lovely find! I spray a little on a blouse or jacket and have that lovely fresh-washed scent lingering all day. It compliments the Falling in Love scent nicely, as both are fairly light, but I love it on its own as a nice change of pace as well. So far it has been just as advertised-- clean, soapy and crisp-- and I'd add that it's just one of the most comforting smells around... makes me want to curl up in a pile of warm towels fresh from the dryer and take a little nap	1
B000E9SRSY:sweet_like_pink_sugar_but_not_as_overpowering:nicole_henry_"nicole_henry"	I love Auqolinas first and ground breaking perfume "Pink Sugar"  to death but it is such an overpowering scent that I am often smelled before I am seen and perhaps such a strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate.	1
B0002JBS1Y:stylish_and_fresh:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	This light, refreshing fragrance is a classic, and you'll use it every day.  The simplicity of this cologne gives it a style all its own	1
B000BWBCQS:the_best_lip_gloss!:goldie_glamour_"cosmeta-phile"	I LOVE Lola lip gloss, it isn't too tacky, lasts a long time, and the colors are gorgeous.  I bought the Fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that I bought La Petite Menagerie as a replacement.  I love the idea of having it on a key chain, so your never without lip gloss!  All the colors in this kit are great.	1
B000EZXYT0:if_you_love_a_tingle_this_is_the_one_for_you!:mkjulia2000_"mkjulia2000"	WOW! My husband and I both use this scrub. It is very refreshing. The salt scrub is easy to apply and leaves a nice minty smell in the shower and on the skin for at least an hour! Like the previous review I feel the chill after getting out of the shower...then I was full of energy! I look forward to trying this one after a hot work out or yard work! This will be a staple in our household!	1
B0001XGNQ6:this_is_an_excellent_razor:t._erickson	The quality and workmanship is top notch! The price is high for a razor, but it will take you less than a year to break even if you are buying cartriges like the Gillette Fusion at $4 a pop! And it will last you a lifetime.  Replacement blades for the razor run about 50 cents each and last a hole lot longer! I was only getting 4-5 shaves from a Fusion blade, but I can shave my face and head for at least 2-3 weeks on a single safey razor blade :) Even if I changed the blade after every shave it would still cost less than a fusion.	1
B0002F1SBI:not_that_bad!:	When i tried  this on it washed make-up and pores nicely but after i washed my face my skin felt so rubbery and a little too dry maybe because i didn`t get the right skin soap for it but when i tried other ones it still had the same effect	1
B0009MHK70:one_more_"a"_for_armani:gail_cooke		1
B0002DNGCY:the_real_deal:chesley_ruff_"a_friendly_kind-a_guy"	For some reason chicks dig this aroma. I've tried many clognes over many years but this gets the best reaction. I'm getting more now at the request of several ladies so I decided to write this review. With my luck they'll stop making the stuff now so I'm buying 5 bottles just in case	1
B00024Y2SK:cover_up_dark_circles:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	Put the "light" back in highlight without that greasy feeling.  Your dark circles will be concealed, and you'll look wide awake	1
B000EDP7PG:minty_happiness:s._garbacik_"create_contentment"	Yum! Fond childhood memories and sweet almost guilty pleasure is created whenever I use this. It smells wonderful. Deliciously scented bubbles blossom on my mesh sponge. This shower gel cleans well without being harsh to sensitive skin. I don't like it as a shampoo as much. When I do use it to wash my hair, I'm sure to follow up with a conditioner. It's a delightful product and I'm pleased with my purchase	1
B0000Y3ECM:great_product.__skin_under_my_eyes_much_prettier:k._graff	I have been using this product for over a year.  Only took a couple of weeks to improve the very thin skin under my eyes. A little goes a long, long way.  One jar lasted me about 4 months using every day.  This product blends into the skin quickly and I use it under make-up.  It calms my skin.  I am happy about this product	1
B0002260VO:this_stuff_is_amazing!:b._phelps	I have used hundreds of kinds of smoothers and conditioners on my thick color-treated hair (it is poofy and rough without any help!)	1
B0002260VO:hay:proust	It is a very good conditioner. It is light and yet conditioning. but to me it smells like hay or cud or something cowish.  It smells distinctively barnyard.  but I see that many like the smell so maybe it is just me.	1
B0007LXKQS:what_a_find!:j.s.l.w.	I have coarse afrcian-american hair that is relaxed straight. This conditioner is the best I have ever used. I wish I could buy it in a larger bottle.  The only thing however, I think it is expensive.  Because of the price I use it only when wanting to deeply condition my hair. Otherwise, I would use it after every shampoo. Wonderful stuff	1
B000BUEPF0:a_tale_from_a_pink_sugar_addict...:amanda_swales	After years of searching I've finally found the perfect perfume. Pink Sugar makes me feel fabulous when I wear it; it's so light and `warm' with a base of sensual vanilla. I have the large bottle, body mousse & deodorent at home, and the smaller bottle in my handbag. I don't get bored with this fragrence, like I do with everything else I've tried over the years.	1
B000K793SI:amazing_grace_how_sweet_the_scent_!!!:l._eubanks_"lori_eubanks"	very paticular about how i smell. dont just wear anything on my skin. but this fragrance is just what a person like me would wear. i so recommend this lovely fragrance to those women who so enjoy having the sweeetest smell flowing from their skin. love this fragrance	1
B000ELWZF8:yummy!!:crazybytch_"crazybytch"	This stuff smells just like philosophy's handmade hand cream but not as strong, that's why I took one point off. It has a light, sweet lemon scent with a vanilla background. Of course it's is wonderful as a shampoo and body gell just like all the other philosophy 3-1's. If it where stronger scented it would be my favorite	1
B0002DL2A2:oh_so_perfect!:veronica_lake_"missy"	It's a lovely light refreshing perfume. Lovely for daywear. Loves it guys	1
B00068O818:totally_love_it!!:s._dixson	I really love this gift set..you will smell sooo yummy!!  At first when I put it on it smelled so familiar, then my husband and I decided it reminds us of sweet cotton candy..we love it!  Although now I am getting hooked on Amazing Grace...also a familiar, clean, fresh, scent. Philosophy is great	1
B0001LVX2C:marvelous:enchantress_of_numbers	Ever wished you could rub your eyes while you're wearing your make up?  Now you can.  You can't be rubbing at your eyes too much or it will start to flake off, but this mascara takes quite a beating before it will budge and will never, ever smudge.  One might be led to believe this means it is difficult to remove at night, but all you need to remove it is water.  This stuff is practically worth getting just to ponder the chemistry involved	1
B00021COT2:wonderful_lip_balm!:bookratt_"bookratt"	With just a hint of sheer red color, this lip balm in a tube is one of the best I've tried. The smell is intoxicating, the feel divine. What's best to me: 1) the subtle shade of red color, sheer but sexy, moisturizing but not greasy or gloppy and 2) it lasts FOREVER. I have never before paid $10 for a tube of lip balm, but I will gladly do it again. For those that wonder who it looks good on: my opinion is everybody! I am a dark-brown haired, light skinned, brown-eyed girl, with no pink or rosy color to my natural dead-white skin color/coloring. I burn easily and freckle, too. My sister has brownish-auburn-hair, medium-toned beige skin color with hazel-brown eyes and it looks great on her, too. She tans easily. My niece is blondish-brown haired, has light brown eyes and fair skin with a bit of pink in it and tans easily. It looked great on her, too.	1
B00021AUVG:ethereal_and_sensual:iris	This has been my everyday scent for the last six years. The predominent note is a sparkling anise, an anise that affects a cold, even metallic, chemic artifice. Swirling about this shivery base note are hints of moss, violet, and vanilla-like tonka, lending an aura of both forest and fantasy.	1
B000225ZVA:make_charming_little_gifts:l._taylor	I love to include one of these with gifts......people love them.....makes a bath really special.....little rosebuds floating in the water.....just charming	1
B000225ZVA:lovely_and_romantic:susie_q.	This is the one you give to someone you love. The wonderful rose scent is very light, not overpowering at all. And the pretty little dried rosebuds are so charming. I love lying in the tub with those rosebuds floating around me. It makes me feel like I'm lying in a beautiful garden	1
B00021D10S:it_really_works!:bekka	I am 5'11" tall, and have stretchmarks everywhere from growing 8 inches in one year as an adolescent.  So I thought I'd get even more of them during my pregnancy and 40 lb. weight gain.  I bought the Mustela lotion as a "might as well" gift to myself, not really expecting anything.  I am thrilled to say that after using this cream every day on my breasts and belly during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy, I didn't get ANY new stretchmarks anywhere.  I still can't believe it -- and I was looking closely for them just to be sure.  The lotion is quite rich, so a little goes a long way -- the tube lasted 8 weeks.  I'm completely sold on Mustela products, and use the super soft and fragrant baby wipes on my new little girl.  No diaper rash at all so far	1
B000A6KWWK:ditch_the_smile_lines:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	Don't be afraid to smile, and don't cover up those smile lines.  You can eliminate them with this amazing product from Clinique	1
B0006NF894:a_different_kind_of_mascara:doberquest_"pet_advocate_in_the_pnw"	Most waterproof mascaras are designed to come off with an oil-based remover.  Stupid idea;   our skin has oil in it.  After a couple hours we end up with "racoon" eyes."  DOH, who needs that?  Mirenesse mascara only comes off with soap AND water, in combination.  Better living through chemistry!  Since I happen to be one of those people with a little extra oil in their skin in adulthood, I especially appreciate this fact, plus they make it in Brown/black  I'm a redhead, and am so sick of   searching for something other than black-black mascara!  It is simply too dark if you are not a brunette or blonde.  I need something with some brown in it, and this mascara fits the bill, perfectly.  For those who find it too clumpy, well, learn how to apply mascara--tweens!  This mascara goes on best with one coat, so make your first application count.  You don't need a second coat.  It won't look good, so do one coat, period.  If you can't get it right the first time, you need some practice and a mirror with a higher magnification.  If you think you need more mascara than that, think again.  Unless you are walking Sunset	1
B0009HJBPE:cover_up_dark_circles:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	Put the "light" back in highlight without that greasy feeling.  Your dark circles will be concealed, and you'll look wide awake	1
B00021DDO2:good_color,_smell,_staying_power,_so-so_value:a._c._lewis	I like that the gloss isn't goopy or sticky, and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while, but you don't get much product. I bought Flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color, so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips. I wasn't really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen. But overall, I do like it, but don't know if I'd buy it again	1
B00021B9O8:love_the_stuff:n._cure_"hufflepuff"	I absolutely love this eyeshadow. I have it in three different colors, as after my first one (the Illuminateur), I got addicted. I've since bought the Ambre and the Bleu Swimming Pool. It can be hard to tell from pictures on this site, or any other, what the color of this item is really like. That is it say, it changes depending on the light. My white Illuminateur looks purple in some lights, shiny white in others, and a light blue in others. It's really amazing on its own, or layered. All of the colors have a lot of "oomph" to them. Make sure you shake the bottle before using for best color results (as mentioned on the packaging).	1
B00063MTKK:cashmere_texture:elizabeth_a._borst	I was very impressed with the texture of these shadows. They slip on softly with a great feel and last all day or night with no creasing. I also like the way the colors will go on subtley with a light touch or with a heavier hand build up for more intensity. The color selection is gorgeous. Just one word of warning -- you can't really go by the color samples. It's better to see them in person. I bought Lilac Mist which is beautiful on the brow bone and was very close to what I was expecting. But Paris By Night looks like a gray but is actually a deep mauve. I was dissapointed until I tried it. It contoured my eyes beautifully and while intense is very natural looking. This is about the fourth time I've bought Laura Mercier products and I've been totally pleased with the quality.	1
B000F3JV48:amazing_everyday_makeup:melaina_lara	I have never found a compact foundation, cream or powder, that looked and lasted even remotely as well as a liquid foundation with a dusting of powder over it. Until now. This is an amazing makeup, and the best part is that it doesn't take a whole lot of product to achieve perfect coverage. My skin tends to be red, but this doesn't even hint at it. Plus, it's a nice matte without being too dry.	1
B000B8WASQ:smells_good_to_me!:a._kane	I thought this stuff smelled fantastic, and very similar to a lavender poundcake. I guess smell is very subjective, though, so if you're not sure about this one, you might want to have a sniff at your local Sephora or department store before purchasing	1
B00021D1H6:delicious_and_classic!:anonymous	I love this scent - it's so fresh yet so distinctive.  Light enough to wear to a ballet or other event where you're in close qurters with others, but distinct enough that people notice it.  Every time I wear it I get compliments on how great I smell.	1
B000HGFEOY:best_chap_stick:amirissa_antonakopoulou	Ok I have really large lips and for years I have tried everything to protect them. Get this tin, for some reason the stick doesn't work as well, and your lips will be unchapped for the whole day. It's pricey but worth every penny if your like me and your lips chap easily. Trust me I have tried everything, even pricier chapsticks and this one does the trick	1
B0002JMZ0W:cover_up_dark_circles:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	Put the "light" back in highlight without that greasy feeling.  Your dark circles will be concealed, and you'll look wide awake	1
B00021CJWE:so_cute_and_feminine:amber	I got some of this body balm yesterday. The lady at the Benefit counter said that it would make my skin look luminescent like a Victoria's Secret model. She put a sample on one of my arms and I held it up to the other arm. The difference was amazing! The arm with the Bathina looked smoother, silker, and had a pearlized look. I can't stop raving about this stuff. It is slightly expensive, but the tin is really big (and adorable) and the supply of the balm is huge. It should last a really long time. This balm is one of the best products that Benefit has	1
B00025BYQM:beautiful!:curly_"red"	I use the Dusty Pink, and I have never ever used a blush that looks so natural, and makes my skin glow so healthy.  With or without the mineral foundation from Youngblood; just lovely.  Highly recommended	1
B0009X74PC:harder_than_i_thought:peggy_"peggy"	After watching Anastasia do eye brows on TV i decided that i needed to get this item and try to do better shaping of my eye brows.  After receiving this kit, i found that is is quite hard to do by yourself.  Holding the stencil in the proper alinement is difficult for one person to do on themselves.  I do however shape my daughters brows.  In conclusion i think that it takes a lot of skill and i think it would be better to go to her personally or some other experienced person.	1
B000B9NA7U:kerastase_volumactive_shampoo:sandra_shrum	Wonderful shampoo.  I have color treated hair and my color stays shiny and my hair is thicker after I shampoo.  I use the shampoo daily and no longer have scalp problems from product buildup	1
B000EQF5XW:honey_is_worth_the_money_:margaret_anne_tolliver	Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true.  This product is rich, but at the same time light.  After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the "cirtus" smell in the product description.  I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size.	1
B0006BDQF4:activate_micro-circulation:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product.	1

B00029V15W:amazing_product!:monica_h.	Face Oasis isn't like any other moisturizer I've tried - One application makes my skin appear plump and well-hydrated even if I've neglected to drink my 8 glasses of water that day.  It isn't at all greasy, absorbs quickly, and serves as a great base over which to apply my makeup. The guys I've introduced it to have raved about it as well!	1
B000AY4STU:absolutely_amazing!:thais_bueno-nielsen_"snake_charmer"	I was a bit weary at trying a Shampoo Bar, but as soon as I took a whiff of this little hockey-puck of sunshine, I was sold.  The scent is strong - so watch out if strong florals give you headaches - so strong, in fact, I can smell the jasmine and honeysuckle wafting out of the shower at this very moment.  When I had it in the bag, fresh from purchase, it scented the entire living room!  The conditioning agent isn't enough for people who use deep conditioners -  I recommend following up the shampooing with a seperate conditioner.  But the Fragrance and ease of rubbing a bit of soap onto wet hair, achieving masses of luscious lather, a quick rinse and go - Priceless!  This is definately a little gem that everyone should try	1
B0001XGNRK:no_fuss,_no_bother,_and_they_work!:joseph_dipietro	With the advent of those truly ridiculous multiblade "shaving systems" (oh, no--not "razors"; they're "shaving systems." Feh.), Merkur blades are a welcome standby. They can be had by the full case (20 10-blade packs) for about $80 or $90. And at about a week per blade, even with "two-pass" shaving (once with the grain of the beard and once against it), that's enough for a few years.	1
B000225ZW4:nice_but_not_my_favorite:kw	like all lush shampoo cakes, it does a great job in cleaning hair and is nice and sudsy. I find the smell to be nothing to write home about. Yes, my hair was shiny, but it tends to be with all of their products. Don't be scared of the glitter though, it's barely there.....all in all, I prefer New and Karma Komba to this one.	1
B0002V316M:oh_wow:stephanie_"182"	This cologne smells great. A guy I know wears it and whenever he hugs me I smell this and well, he smells fantastic. In fact, the way he smelled was one of the first things that interested me in him. I'm a big fan of the original Curve cologne, which smells really nice as well...boys/men can't go wrong wearing either of them	1
B000225ZG0:this_stuff_is_amazing:k._m._doemland	I'm a sort of sweaty type, so I usually like an antiperspirant/deodorant, but sometimes the antiperspirant ingredients give me a rash, and it's really not practical to use them all over everywhere on every single part of your body that might get whiffy. Aromarant is quick and easy to use, doesn't make you itchy or rashy no matter where you use it, and works so well as a deodorant that it makes you want to do an infomercial for it free of charge	1
B000ALY3P2:just_about_the_best:w._phillips_"coffehound"	lipstick going. This review is for the Guava Stain shade. I first bought this lipstick, I believe in the mid to late eighties. I was delighted with it then and am now. It is sheer, light, non greasy and the color never changes. The color is NOT neutral, but I find that I can wear it with almost any color of clothing except primarily pink or red outfits. Over the years it has become just about the only lipstick shade I wear. I would buy different brands,different shades and wear them maybe once then back to Guava Stain. It along with Clinque's soft pressed blush in New Clover, orginally bought about the same time as the lipstick have become my favorites, and the one's I reach for time and again. They are my dependables. Daytime wear for sure, not night, this is a subtle sheer color	1
B00021E3W8:the_inside_scoop...:vintage-noir	I am actually an employee for L'Occitane (pronounced Lox-ee-tahn; that's the question i get asked every day! lol). I have only been working for the company at their Santa Barbara store for about 2 weeks, and this is what I've learned about the Artemesia Shampoo: This IS the shampoo that ALL Four Season's Carry. The packageing may seem different if you were at a four season's in another country, but this is the ONLY shampoo of ours that they carry (once in a while people dont believe me, but TRUST me- they train us on which one it is).  People come in everyday for this shampoo because they loved it so much at the four seasons.  In fact, the company SOLD OUT and our store (which ran out quickly because there is a four seasons in Santa Barbara) had many unhappy customers because they couldnt find it.  The scent is heavenly and lasting on your hair. Some other products you might want to try out? The four Seasons also carrys our Verbena Shea Soap, Verbena body lotion, and our Lavender linen water (which makes clothes smell great when used in ironing). Also, just to let you know, this week we're getting new products for our Honey line (btw- try the honey body balm- I'm HOOKED) including a cleanser, milk bath, and honey massage nectar. Hope this information helps some of you- Enjoy!	1
B00032ORCC:great_spot_treatment:donna_e._hoskins	I use this on the ocasional hormonal breakout and it is super. It is easy to apply, goes on clear and is very powerful. It works to clear up that spot in record time. I'd highly recommend it	1

B0006ODP7U:the_best_acne_cover_stick_i_have_tried:sammy_madison	This concealer comes in a pencil form, so it is very precise and offers very good coverage.  It stays on well.  It is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers, so you can put it in a small, precise spot and it will actually stay there.  I have tried many concealers for small blemishes, and this is my favorite.  It comes in enough shades so you can find a good match, which is important	1
B00021CVYA:love_it:minhnga	The scent is so unforgettable, fresh and sexy and sweet and... it's just the best among the best	1
B0006FVCWY:great_gift!:carissa_l._damico_"classy_lady"	I received the Soku Lime candle as a gift and was so thrilled!  The box itself is decorative and I re-used it as a pencil holder on my desk. The scent is very aromatic and long lasting. I had relatives over and they remarked on the scent as soon as they entered my house. I was very pleased.	1
B0002ID6WY:wow!:sharon_e._karina_"sharon"	I agree with the reviewer who likened it to actual lemon juice.  It is very strong, and I realized after spraying it twice it only needed once... most likely because it is an eau de parfum and not eau de toilette.  Very much worth the money.  I was complimented on it the entire day. It does not resemble lemon Pledge to me at all	1
B0002ID6WY:a_fresh,_clean_summer_smell:melissa_miller	Not your typical thick, floral-smelling perfume, this perfume smells exactly like its name advertises--like lemon juice mixed with sugar.  It's a seasonal perfume (I can't imagine smelling like lemons in the winter).  It smells very crisp, fresh, and clean, which I enjoy a lot, but I imagine others would not; the same things I like about this perfume, could smell like a cleaning product to others.  Go to your fridge.  Get a lemmon, squeeze its juice out into a cup and add some sugar.  If you enjoy the smell you get, buy this perfume--I highly recommend it.  If not, stick to something more traditional and vanilla/floral like Ana Sui's "Dolly Girl"	1
B00021BT6G:a_good_toner:a._smith	I bought this after using other Murad products and loving them. I like this, but I wouldn't say I love it. First, it's a bit overpriced. I can get a comparable drugstore product for a fraction of the price. The toner itself is decent, but doesn't seem to clean as deeply as other toners. However, for those who find toners to be a bit harsh, this may be a good option. Non-drying and doesn't have that toner "burn". Overall, a decent product, but not one I am sure I would re-purchase	1
B000HGJI6E:good_for_balanced_skin:s._tilney_"stilney"	My skin was winter dry and I expected this product to have richer moisturizing qualities. The scent is nice, but quite strong.  Not a 5-star product as I usually get at Body Shop, but works fine for more balanced skin	1
B000E1336S:your_search_is_over_-_this_one_actually_smells_when_lit.:britney_jackson	know you. You were me. Looking for what seemed to be a simple thing - a scented candle that ACTUALLY smells up the room when you light it. You've bought the cheap ones in the grocery store that sent out the weak scent of, well, grocery store. And some candles smell like spray room deodorizer which smells like what one would use in the toilet which then make you think of poop which is not at all what you were going for in the living room. So then you hit the expensive pretty versions - perhaps even in candle stores with cute waxy names. They are not candles, my friend. They are sculptures. Some fancy ones come with cute packaging and crispy dried flowers. This is when you lose your patience. I DO NOT WANT CRISPY DRIED FLOWERS. I WANT A CANDLE THAT PUMPS A GOOD SCENT ALL OVER A ROOM WHEN I LIGHT IT.	1
B00029UYO6:saved_my_winter_skin:christie_in_wisconsin	I got this as a gift from my mother last year.  This product saved my hands and feet!  It helped them stay soft.  No more itchy ankles or knuckles.  I preferred to use this at night, but I do use it on my feet almost everyday before I put my socks on for the day.  It moisturizes without too heavy of a feeling	1
B00021E8GY:definitely__very_irresistible:melissa_marrocco	love love love this scent. i have received many compliments about it. long lasting and definitely addictive. i think its more of a late-fall and winter scent if i do say so myself	1
B000226064:this_conditioner_is_fabulous!:andraya_trybus_"andraya"	I love this conditioner! It smells divine and it made my hair feel like silk! My hair is ash blonde and i noticed a very slight lift in colour. Regardless, I recommend this product highly, especially for dry, damged hair. I recommend this product in conjunction with "NEW! (Hair) Solid Shampoo Bar", also made by Lush Cosmetics	1
B000KE19RO:worth_the_price:jerry_c	I use this conditioner as well as the other pumpkin products. Having bleached hair, I didn't think I'd have healthy looking and feeling hair until I discovered these products. They are worth their weight in gold!  They leave my hair soft,manageable and healthy looking and the smell is wonderful	1
B0002JVML0:oh_my:robin_huber_"robin"	I just love this product, it takes away the dead skin on your face and leaves it sparkling clean , there are little diamond flakes left as well you face looks radiant and young... I will not be without this produc	1
B000225ZTW:great_idea_and_great_for_summer_skin:ellen_"emw314"	This is alittle "heavier" than usual summer skin products, ie	1
B000ALBNBY:no-crease_coverage_makes_a_great_base_for_color!:kelli_hanson_"pathologicmd"	I don't remember when I first tried this product, but now I've been using it for years and I love it! This is a great eye color base. It goes on smoothly, without rubbing or pulling the skin, and provides a smooth base for powder eye color. I wear it every day under my eye makeup. It makes my eyeshadow last all day without creasing or fading. Plus it comes in many colors to compliment whatever colors of eyeshadow you're wearing. Try it, and you'll love it too	1
B00015CH00:fyi:jenine_ferrari	Great product from a company that only offers innovative wonderful products- this product shouldn't cost this much though.  It costs less at authorized Bb. retail outlets and buying Bb. products online doesn't guarantee the consumer that they're getting authentic Bb., so beware.   Check out www.bumbleandbumble.com for authorized retailers	1
B0009X7TPM:nice,_but_could_be_better...:zed	This is a really great scent, but it could of been better. I think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals.  I mean seriously, animals want to smell nice too	1
B00021BZCO:fantastic_scent:jennifer_k._rupp	I'd never bought a perfume above ten dollars when I tried Burberry Brit's Eau de Toilette one day. I couldn't believe how wonderful the scent was, especially after it had been on for a while. I splurged on a bottle which seems set to last me for a long time (even with almost-daily use, it's still mostly full). I consider this to be my signature scent, and get many compliments on it	1
B000BLGVBK:philosophy_falling_in_love:j._holowaty_"jenna"	I love the smell ... and I much prefer the solid perfume to the spray ... just subtle enough ....	1
B0002260MI:decent:lush_princess	Bubbles nicely but does not smell like "hot milk". I've never tried milky bar so I have no idea if the two compare. Hot Milk? IS comforting though. Its like being wrapped in warm fluffy towels straight from the dryer	1
B0006NIW0G:this_stuff_smells_great!:computer_chick	I bought this on a whim because I just remodeled my house after Hurricane Katrina and now have a huge jacuzzi tub...nice to take long baths in so of course I needed some bubble stuff.  The bath bombs smell wonderful.  My whole bathroom smelled of the bath bombs until I used them all.  I even put the box they came in into my closet and it made my closet smell wonderful (for about a week)!  The bombs each have something special inside of them that you find out about when they dissolve.  The fizzing is fun and the smell lingered on my skin until the next day.  I loved them and will definitely buy more	1
B000B9PSCK:worth_every_penny_-_your_hair_will_fell_like_silk_&_smell_great!:maria_bacarisa_"honest_opinionated_filipina"	I'm not kidding, it's worth every penny (though I must admit that I get it at a lower price from a secret supplier in Asia). After using this, you'll swear that you just got a hot oil/deep treatment done from a professional salon.	1
B0002260DC:avocado_bath_heaven:valerie	I like to eat avocados, I like avocado face masks, and now I can bathe in eau de avocado!  This bath bomb is possibly my favorite - very softening, great color (turns your tub into a nice green lagoon), and great lemony scent.  I didn't find the glitter to be very noticeable, so don't worry about that.  Stock up on this one	1
B000EGWL0M:burberry_london-_i'm_a_convert:shoshanna	Was using philosophy's various light scents, discovered this Burberry London sample in my last Sephora shipment. Went to Macy's and bought the set for under $77-lotion, shower gel and 3.3 oz fragrance. Fretted over price until I actually used the products-layering them. Recieved SO many compliments! Not "an old lady's perfume"- not strong nor weak- it has an elegant floral fragrance.	1
B00021E34Q:awesome_sensual_fragrance:j._g._peterson_"dance_music_lover"	I first caught a waft of this fragrance in a magazine as a tester. I fell in love with the sweet, sugary light smell of it and so did my husband. It's perfect for all seasons since it's light and it definitely makes people ask you what you're wearing. I've been told it smells everything from edible to kissably sweet. Now I want to try some of their other fragrances. If they are half as good as this, they win in my book	1
B0002J5HB6:this_product_is_amazing:c._hendrix	This mattifying moisturizer is GREAT!  It definitely helps with my oily skin and works all day long.  I can't say more than enough positive effects this moisturizer has had on m	1
B000141FAE:best_tweezers_i've_ever_used!!:l._burke	I had an Amazon reward certificate and was looking for something practical to use it on.  It so happened that I needed new tweezers.  I read the reviews and thought I'd give these a try.  Wow, I can't believe the difference in quality from any other tweezers I have ever owned.  They almost seem to adhere to whatever your are trying to grasp.  It is so easy to precisely and almost painlessly remove even the finest eyebrow hair.  Tweezerman Tweezers ROCK!	1
B00021AKMA:this_is_an_obsession:bonnie_sayers_"autismfamily"	I have been wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein since it was first launched in 1985, the year I first arrived in California. It seems I am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents. While I prefer the eau de parfum spray I have both variations. Although at first this tends to have a strong aroma, this doesn't last after being applied to your skin. I love the blend of vanilla, mandarin orange, peach and lemon that make up the scent of Obsession.	1
B000ACP5YE:if_it_worked_for_me,_i_believe_it_will_work_for_you:a._wadhawan_"hmmduh"	The cream is great. It instantly gets absorbed  after application and i believe helps over time close up leakage of blood capilleries (which causes black circle appearences). I suffered from chronic dark circles. This cream after 1 month of application has considerably lightened my dark circles and has reduced puffiness. I would suggest anyone who is looking for an effective cream give this product a shot. considering my condition i still have light dark circles left and hope this cream will continue to benefit me. I still have doubts on this cream totally brightening my skin tone around my eyes, but never the less I find it effective	1
B0006H2ZLO:breaks_the_bank--but_i'll_never_use_another!:l._davis	This is by far the most expensive relaxer I've ever used and it is worth every penny.  I first heard of it as being Oprah's relaxer so I decided to hunt it down.  One of the best things I've ever done.  I have very coarse, thick "horsehair" that usually defeats most over the counter perms after a few washings.  Not Phytospecific's relaxer.  My hair stayed soft AND STRAIGHT no matter what the weather or I did to it. And it's the healthiest it's ever been.  No other relaxer ever did that for my hair.  In fact they usually made it worse! I absolutely love the Phytorelaxer and I am officially addicted.  If it were less pricey, it would get 5 stars	1
B0008GJQY2:best_product_for_straight,_shiny_hair!:gigi	To tell you the truth, I have tried everything on my hair to take away the frizz.  Nothing really worked at all...but Biosilk is a miracle!  The first time  I tried it, I noticed a major difference in my hair.  Just add a little bit to your hair, and it will immediately smooth it out, adding shine and softness.  It will also not weigh your hair down or make it too greasy..just don't use that much of it.  I mostly use this with my flat-iron, and I get amazing results.  I happen to like the smell of it...it reminds me of being in a salon!  Try the shampoo and conditioner as well	1
B00029V0QM:i_love_this_product!:monica_h.	This is truly one of the best hand and nail creams out there.  It is quickly absorbed and not at all greasy - I put some on before I walk out the door in the morning and again before bedtime and it has made a real difference in the softness of my hands and the health of my cuticles.  Hangnails have always been a problem for me but this product keeps them under control as long as I apply it regularly. Love it!	1
B00021A72I:works_great_with_the_socks:elizabeth_a._borst	This salve is just perfect under Bliss's Softening socks. It's amazing how much you can smear on, leave on with the socks for at least half an hour and have all those great softening agents completely absorbed when you take off the socks. It leaves feet renewed. Use it once or twice a week to tame tough tootsies	1
B0001XGNQQ:excellent_razor:trav	My very first DE razor after many recommendations, and I must say that I am yet another one of those enthusiastic supporters of the Merkur HD DE Safety Razor.  I may eventually decide to upgrade, but if I ever do, it will only be after much practice with this razor and simply for the sake of having the adjustment feature, which may or may not be necessary for some individuals depending on the toughness and thickness of your beard.  When used in conjunction with a badger hair shaving brush, some excellent shaving cream (Proraso was my first, and the only thing mildly unpleasant is the scent, and even that grows on you after a while...check your local Target near the women's spa section) and the highest quality DE razor blade, changed every so often, of course, this razor provides an excellent, close, irritation-free shave.  After using this marvel, I vow never to return to the cheaply made, ridiculously expensive (when the cost of replacement cartridges is considered over the course of a man's shaving lifetime) multi-blade systems of Gillette or Schick.  Just be a little more careful of your technique, and getting an outstanding shave from this razor should be a cinch.  Highly recommended	1
B0007TJOEM:light_conditioner_for_combination/oily_hair:rebecca_johnson_"the_rebecca_review,_finding_beauty_in_the_world_-_www.seasonedwithlove.com"	If your hair alternates between various moods every day of the week, then a good supply of conditioners and shampoos should keep you happy all year long. The lemon oil in two of the Lush products work together especially well. Veganese Conditioner and I Love Juicy shampoo could not be a better solution if you need to deep clean your hair. Like after you have put too much hairspray in your hair or you went swimming or say you fell in a mud puddle (In that case, also reach for Happy Hippy body wash).	1
B00068O764:effective_and_simple_to_use.:jennifer_ortiz_"jenortiz"	I really like this peel.  It is very easy to use and I have noticed a difference in my skin.  It is clearer and the redness and discoloration is fading.  I even noticed my clogged pores are diminishing.  I recommend this peel to anyone.  I have very sensitive skin and it did not cause irritation.  I use this one about twice a week.	1
B0002JBO2W:best_of_the_best:amanda_elliott	Caleche is an absolute classic.  I'm often stopped and asked what I'm wearing.  Pretty much everything at the department stores smells the same (LIKE CHEMICALS).  Caleche is the real thing and the Soie de Parfum lasts. Make sure when purchasing that you don't accidentally buy Caleche Eau Delicate...it's a completely different frangrance, guaranteed to make you gag.  Why do marketers keep coming up with subtle twists to existing fragrances (Miracle, Happy, Pleasures, Poison)?  Once you try Caleche, you'll no longer look for anything else; I highly recommend the lotion and shower gel, too	1
B0008EZBDO:south_of_france_in_a_bottle:bec_"bec16"	I've never smelled anything like this.  If you've ever been to the Mediterranean coast, you will be instantly transported by this scent.  It goes on strong, lasts long, and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy-citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air - but not the "Yankee Candle Ocean Water" type scent... this is the real thing, like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you!  Rejoice, all women who are tired of sugary-syrupy womens' perfume!  This is it	1
B00021DDGK:baby_powder:l._meehan	This is a nice smell that turns babypowderish on me.  My fiancee LUVS it.  He is also a huge fan of Chanel No.	1
B00062A8FY:beautiful_and_long_lasting_lip_gloss:a._wagoner	This lip gloss is super!!!  Not only does it glide on your lips, it has staying power.  The colors are so subtle and pretty.  It is worth every penney and I will not waste my money on cheaper, sticky and short-lived lip glosses	1
B0002DN4MG:awesome:m._musial_"abercrombie_guy_38"	Almost every time I wear "Curve" I get comments from the ladies, a very good thing.  I currently have 10 different types of cologne and I wear this one a lot.  It seems good and the scent lasts throughout the day without having to drench yourself in it	1
B00021E5OE:it's_no_miracle_product,_but_it_seems_to_work.:j._schmidt	I have been using this starter kit for almost a month and I am beginning to see results. My experience with this product has been that my skin definitely got worse before it got better. For the first few weeks, my skin seemed to explode with more acne than usual... however, last week it started to clear up rapidly. I'm still having blemishes pop up daily, but they disappear within a few days, and overall my skin is much smoother and my (many, many) scars are less visible. I have struggled with moderate to severe acne for 6 years and have tried more products and treatments than I care to remember, and decided to try Murad after it was suggested to me (I'd never heard of it before). It certainly is no "miracle" product where you see results instantly (especially if you have a moderate to severe acne problem), but I just re-ordered the starter kit and am hoping the results will continue to improve. This product is definitely worth a shot	1
B000EWXZ24:this_is_the_best.:stefohnee_"stef"	I have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product I've ever tried to use, but buffy got my skin so smooth! Amazing, and highly recommended. Soak in the tub/shower/whatever so the hot water softens up your skin, then scrub away. The small bar lasts 2 or 3 uses; the large is twice as big. The small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff.	1
B000K74XT2:true_advertisement!:v._cohran-howard_"teddie"	The smell is great the feel on the skin is great!  Just like the other reviews suggest!	1
B000KAD5LG:great_moisturizer:j._tiedman	Best face cream ever, but even though Cosmetic Mall .com had it for less, the three week shipping, and Poor service from USPS from China, I'll pay the extra buck and get it from Nordstom again next time	1
B00021AL9C:amazing!:ashley_b._wishart_"~_ashley"	This nail polish is by far the best nail product I have ever purchased! I stumbled accross it in France two summers ago and have been dying to find it ever since. The brush is great, depositing the polish smoothly and thinly, the product dries quickly and lasts a long time. It is AMAZING	1
B0002A65MA:philosophy's_cinnamon_buns:aurora_betancourt_"aurora_betancourt"	After hearing so many good things about Philosophy's Cinnamon Buns, I just had to try it out for myself. I found it to not really smell like cinnamon buns, but more like water mixed with sugar. If you use it on your head, it will leave a lingering smell, but it won't last long on your body after taking a shower. I think this product is a nice way of treating yourself, but I definitely do not think it smells like cinnamon buns, which left me slightly disappointed. Overall, a great product	1
B0002PRZRE:gorgeous!:veronica_lake_"missy"	This is by far the most delicious scent ever, NO OTHER PERFUME COMES EVEN CLOSE, I use it everyday and it is worth every cent	1
B000EQF4NS:i_gotta_have_it!:n._jones	I absolutly love ALL of Carol's daughter's products.  Everything to me is true to description.  I recieved my Almond Cookie gift set in the mail and I couldnt wait to open it. The smell is to die for, sometimes I open my Shea Souffle' just so I can smell it. I also love her labels and containers.  I will forever be a customer of Carol's Daughter and I look forward to the day where I can walk into one of her stores. Her prices are worth every dime. Remember you get what you pay for	1
B0007MYMSM:mario_badescu_junky:aviva_gill_"aviva220"	Gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin! Gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust!	1
B0002I5ZYG:soft_footies:lesley_k._ward_"kitschykitschycool.com"	I actually got a sample from the LUSH store in San Francisco and just tried it-it's fabulous on my cracked and peeling heels	1

B000926YW2:happy_with_hypnose:carey_"cherrycarey"	So far this is the best thickening mascara I have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores. It is not sticky or gloppy and you won't look like Tammy Fay with spider lashes. I do however, have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes, but I have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras. My journey ends here	1
B000BO3LLA:i_love,_love_this_product!:s._ruth	I love, love this product. I can't believe how much I actually used it; I ran out of my box within two months! All those tops that have a wide open neck needed the bra strap to sit on the edge of my shoulder--this kept my straps in place all day and night! A few of my work tops have buttons that stop short towards the bottom; I use the strips to close the flap in place so it's smooth all the way down. Tip: in some cases I cut the strips in half; even half a strip holds my bra straps in place. This product holds things in place or down, it does not lift and hold--its not ducked tape.	1
B00068O7TG:exfoliate_saved_my_face:c._glush	I suffered from a severe case of shingles that affected the right side of my face.  The infection left scars on half of my face.  I started using the Exfoliate Kit regularly. After four months, my face now looks normal, and I'm able to go without makeup again.  Thanks Philosophy	1
B0002JBHFG:long_time_user:jjl	I have been using this product for years.  I have a really oily T-zone, and I find that this product keeps it in control.  It is a very good cleanser that removes the oil without drying your skin.  No matter what color your skin tone may be, I think you will like this product!	1
B0006IQK5U:nothing_else_works!:katherine_g._leis_"yakh262"	I have used Tend Skin for around three years now for razor bumps on the bikini line. Before I started using it, I had tried everything else and resigned to the fact that I'd always be stuck with bumps along the bikini line. A friend of mine told me about Tend Skin and swore by it, so I bought a small bottle. It seemed like it was expensive, but that first bottle lasted well over 6 months. It does smell like alcohol at first but the smell goes away when it dries. As far as the other reviews on here, I've only had stinging when I used it IMMEDIATELY after shaving...I think b/c the pores were still open from the shower. For me, it's been a skin saver when I'd already given up the search. I hope that the negative reviews on here don't discourage people from trying it. Everyone's skin reacts somewhat differently. Of the millions of bottles of Tend Skin sold every year, I think the half dozen people on here who didn't like it are the few unhappy rarities, not the average who, like me, thank goodness it's around.	1
B0007D3B56:my_signature:s._waldon_"darling_nikki"	I LOVE THIS PERFUME. IT HAS BEEN MY SIGNATURE EVERYDAY SCENT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW. ALOT OF PEOPLE ASK WHAT YOU ARE WEARING BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD... AND GUYS LOVE IT TOO	1
B000225ZM4:simply_amazing:angelina	This treatment works extremely well!  I looked on here and saw that there were no extrememly helpful reviews, so I decided to write one. I have long, golden, untreated hair. However it was as dry as straw so I decided to try this. Here how it is: the smell is amazing (it smells like pumpkin pie or gingerbread cookies) after use the hair looks soft and shiny, however it makes hair flat. This product is a deep moisturizer therefore the hair does not have any "pouf" to it. It is still worth the money though! Rehydration of the hair is supremely important and this rehydrates well. Just after shampooing do not use a conditioner (unless that just doesn't work well for you), which helps the flatness.	1
B00021DSHO:tastes_good_but_doesn't_last:zuberdeen	If you like the citrusy scent of other Fresh products (as I do) then you will probably really like this lip balm. It has a lovely lemony taste, and a soft, smooth texture. It's not waxy or greasy, and my husband likes to kiss me when I have it on! The only reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it doesn't last as long as I'd like. My lips tend to get pretty chapped in the winter, and I put balm on at night to condition my lips. This one is gone after about 30 minutes to an hour, so I need a much more concentrated lip balm (like Bliss balm) for night use. But if you're looking for a light, yummy balm, this might be it	1
B000225ZVU:i_love_the_product...:alisha_hime	but it definitally did not work as it was intended. It is intended to moisturize hair. I have long, fine, oily hair, and I received Trichomania as a gift. I love the smell, but when I first used it, it left my hair very dry which I consider a good thing considering the state of my hair. It just didnt do what it was supposed to. However, if you have really oily hair, this is the thing for you. No problems with lathering either, especally if you rub the bar in your hair, not in your hands. Doesnt leave white flakes either	1
B00021BVS2:murad_acne_spot_treatment_review:happy2	Works exceptionally well.  Clears pimple faster than other types of treatments I have used and reduces the redness very quickly.  My 2 teenage daughters love the product as well.  Because such a small amount is needed a tube will last a long time.  Will definitely buy it again!	1
B00021BGNW:hard_candy_super_shine_gloss:cheryl_havanac	I love this lip gloss, the cake batter taste/smell is totally addictive.  The colors are lacking though, all of the colors are light, very sheer shades. I bought the color Babydoll which is a light pink.  It goes on sheer and I love the smooth texture too. This product is supposed to have glitter in it but I didnt' notice any, and/or its not too glaring, which makes it fine for me to wear it at work.	1
B000B8VBKO:great_purple_iron:miss_shari_e_"miss_shari_e*"	great iron and its purple! heats up fast, stays hot, variable hotness levels..great i own this and the next size up and love them both	1
B0001Z97QM:great_keratosis_pilaris_treatment:l._dewitt	I have searched far & wide for a product that aids in the treatment/management of keratosis pilaris (little red bumps on the backs of my arms).  It is estimated that 40-50% of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition.	1
B00021D252:sure_this_is_2_month's_worth???:bill__o'rights_"william"	yes, i've had murad for about 2 weeks now and i've seen huge improvement! murad is a godsend! anyways... i was just wondering if the kit is really supposed to last me 2 months? i use it every morning and night. thats 120 times! umm... dont know if im gonna have any left... i know for sure the cleanser i will. (step 1) but steps 2 and 3 are very small quantity... and hopefully i wont need a lot of acne spot treatment usage cause they'll be all gone :) i definately recommend murad to everyone. like others, i've tried proactiv, but murad seems to work better with my skin. just try the one month starter kit first	1
622	The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.	0
7182	Noam Chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his, yours, and mine - the United States of America.  He has made millions of dollars teaching, lecturing, selling his books, and investing.  His world-wide fame in psycholinguistics is well-deserved.  His infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own Jewish ethnicity and the U.S., in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the United States.  He has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of American foreign policy.  He goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism, when he always ranks the U.S. and Israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now, and even in history.  His distrust of any authority, benign or otherwise, is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the "underdog," even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as Al Queda or Hezbollah.	0
14729	How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding	0
20657	I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.	0
23126	Why in the world would anyone publish a writer's bread and butter notes to his agent?  Besides the money, I mean.  There are a couple or three interesting fulminations against this publisher or that editor, whom Heinlein feels did him dirty.  But in the main this body of correspondence is of zero interest to any but the most complete worshipers of the sf master.  Just enjoy the stories, and nevermind the workaday business of how they got published	0
26778	I admit, I haven't finished this book.  A friend recommended it to me as I have been having problems with insomnia.  I was interested in reading a book about women's health issues and this one sounded intriguing UNTIL she started in with her tarot cards, interest in astrology and angels.  Granted, I am not a firm believer in just "the hard facts" but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn't alternative enough for her!	0
32464	I've been following the Alex Cross series from its beginning, and after reading Cat & Mouse, I'm wondering if Patterson has taken these characters as far as they can go... Given the fact that there are 7 or 8 more Cross books written subsequently to this one, I can only hope that the series gets better.	0
39440	This story is very dark, full of menace and dark thoughts. Not great for kids. OK for adults if that's what you like. A hard story, not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments	0
48548	Though this book does present all the necessary information for learning about abnormal psychology, it's the dryest, most aesthetically difficult to read textbook... especially if you happen to be studying the material online/through independent study.  The publisher needs to redesign the book and/or you need to have a better online course professor. It feels nearly impossible to be interested in this material (which is interesting in itself) if you have to read the textbook front to back on your own without any instruction.	0
53422	If you are interested in a very traditional approach from a professional photographer, this book will provide lots of information.  It also provides valuable tips about controlling the dog.  But  for my taste, I found the photographic results to be uninspiring - too much posing, too much portraiture lighting, not enough of just plain capturing that  wonderful dog as it is	0
59045	This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about.	0
64905	I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.	0
73122	How can a best-selling author like Simon Winchester take an event as exciting as the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 and turn it into a tedious snooze-fest? One answer: write as if you had just discovered an adjective mine and were free to throw in extra descripitive terms on every line until listeners scream for an end to florid phrases. Another: strive to break the record for most clich?s in a single paragraph. Finally: write about events in 1906 as if no one but Simon Winchester had ever before thought about their consequences -- thus, everything in this tedious narrative becomes about Simon. Simon and the raccoons; Simon on the failing American economy; Simon attempting to reproduce American accents. This is a CD set for avoiding	0
79497	It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through	0
84097	I am not sure why the author thought he had something to offer on this subject.  There was no original thought or useful lessons on the topic that was promised by the title.  I read this book because it was the subject of an on-line book club for public health leaders but will be much more discriminating in the future regarding the purchase of books that are recommended by this group.	0
91506	What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good	0

96645	Ann Coulter is unbelievable in her unrelenting hatred of anyone not in aggreement with her warped sense of reality.  To her there is no middle ground.    I am an educated, well travelled adult who while born in the United States, spent a good portion of my childhood living overseas and consider myself to be fairly open minded.  To be called a communist, a traitor, and an enemy of America just because I don't buy into the ultra conservative mind think is an insult to the freedom that this country was founded on.	0
107289	Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks....	0
111763	I wonder if Jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. One cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a Tom Clancy or John D. Macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. I do not think this is a bad thing, but I, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., Macdonald's &quot;Cape Fear,&quot; or use that tired Native American romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. As for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. What we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the Walker parents, Davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, Lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding Medicine Woman. Her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. The men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. I kept seeing Jance speaking for them. So we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for Hollywood to call and possibly star Penelope Cruz as Lani Walker. What's the Tohono O'otham word for &quot;2 thumbs down?&quot	0
119783	I ordered this book after reading the rave reviews and the who's who of public school using this format.  Nowhere is it advertised or even mentioned that this is a Christian book, espousing Christian dogma and assumptions.  I'm surprised this is acceptable for use by Government funded public schools.  Furthermore, there is a lot of non-scientific rhetoric in the book that eschews logical debate and exposition.  I'm very disappointed and consider this to be false advertising.	0
126134	"American Buffalo" was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic.  It is indeed raw, but not at all fantastic.  The dialogue is very choppy and I felt out of the loop with it - as if I missed some great detail.  Perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed, rather than just read. I do not recommend	0
131653	I had never read any of  Vernor Vinges books before, but i had heard he was an excellent author, so I thought I would try this.  Boy, am I glad I bought it used on Amazon for about only $4.  I simply had no idea what was going on in this novel. The plot is unintelligible. I dont know what the Bioweapon  the jacket refers to is? I dont know what "the Rabbit" is.  I see that numerous other reviews here, did not know what was going on either. I do not understand how someone could write so incoherently.	0
136635	The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.	0
141366	When I found out Francis Collins has written a book about his faith, I ordered it the same day.  After all, we seemed to be following the same path.  I earned a PhD in Molecular Biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  Then I found Christ as a 40-year-old.  My transition was from a semi-serious Jew to a Materialist to a serious Christian.  Hearing about Dr. Collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued.	0
147340	Obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  I am not one of them.  Perhaps it's because I don't care for science fiction.  I found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point I stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a Twilight Zone cliche.  If, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed.	0
156761	This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.	0
176220	This is just another attack by organized medicine on Alternative treatments and therapies, in particular chiropractic. Dr. Rosenfeld comes across as biased, ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides. His assertion that he "loves chiropractors is disingenous at best." He prefers non-specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe (toxic) drugs. He lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare, occuring one in many millions, and suggests that these are common occurances. He fails to mention that the practice of (Allopathic) medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in The United States, which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called "Alternatives". If you want good advice, start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors, especially this one!!	0
184023	McMurry's text is a very friendly, gentle intro to  organic. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read, but it doesn't teach you what you need to  know.  Explanations for important mechanisms are usually very brief, and the  problems included are usually very basic and general (the spectroscopy and  synthesis problems, in particular).  If you're looking to become a chemist,  this is not the book to learn from. I'd recommend  Vollhardt and Schore's  textbook, or any number of sophomore-level texts that will give you the  skills you need to approach complicated problems more successfully (i.e.,  on exams or out in the industry)	0
187600	This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard	0
191330	I bought the book after a practitioner used this technique on me. However, the information provided is too extensive and confusing, listing far too many "points" in the body with corresponding healing touches to keep track of them. The body map listing them is in the first part of the book, so you have to flip back and forth to see what the author is referring to. I also thought some of the miraculous healing claims a little outrageous. The way this system originated is also a little murky. This is a better book for people training to learn this practice than for the lay public	0
194901	I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.	0
204322	Although I have only read a few specific subjects in this book, I am only giving it 1 start because the information in the section on hyperemesis is extremely inaccurate and perpetuates outdated myths about this very serious and life-threatening disease. For anyone who has had hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), reading that a spa day would be beneficial, is not only absurd, but also insulting. Many women with HG cannot get to another room of the house without help, much less drive a car to a spa! HG is a disease and not a psychological condition. Women cannot stop the disease at will. This myth has resulted in a century of poor and sometimes abusive treatment of these afflicted women, causing excessive and unnecessary stress and misery, not to mention preventable complications during pregnancy and in their resulting children. Some women have life-long effects. (...	0
212190	The book is well-written.  Most parts of it I can agree with.  But there is a crucial mistake in Parson's message --- oneness likes to play separation.   I can say clearly that oneness does not play separation.  Duality/ego is simply a mistake/illusion caused by mind-evolution.  Saying that oneness plays separation is giving reality to this illusion.  Also, his message that we can not do anything still gives one a feeling that one is under the "mercy" of something, and this is clearly very dualistic.  Without ego, both doing and not doing are actions of oneness, to intentionally emphasizing not doing is a mistake.  There are many illuminating sentenses in this book, but be aware of the neo-advaitan trap.  In my life, it was understanding, especially of the process of ego-illusion-image helped me to come to oneness.  The one who is doing the understanding is still oneness.  There is no duality in doing and not doing.  At right this moment, you can chose to continue to read this review or to stop.  Of courses, you make choices in daily life.  If you really understand what is meant by "nond-duality", you will not make such statements such as "there is no choice".	0
217097	At least this author mentions the "mockery" strategy Martha/Mdiddy tried to use to "fog" the public. The "real issue" of whether Martha/Mdiddy committed the crimes, and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question "DID MARTHA STEWART" lie, demonstrates some complacency. Is it this complacency Martha/Mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote? Is it the "greyness" of white-collar crime that Martha/Mdiddy was trying to play on? Is society the ultimate judge about a person's guilt or innocence? If so, what has Martha/Mdiddy been judged?	0
223147	i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.	0
233400	Being a second generation member of this so called "cult" and having parents that went through the same situation as the author, I can say that he must have too weak to fulfill his duty to god and true parents...It's very sad when a member must leave. By sacrifcing you are able to develop a stronger relationship with god. Hope this helps..	0
238328	I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.	0
249466	I love dogs but if I had wanted to know the ins and outs of dog obedience training, including the different levels snd sub-levels, I would have bought a manual. I wanted a mystery with fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing. I got neither. The characters were neither likeable nor substantive. Except for the cop next door, I have no idea what they even look like or what, if anything, they care about besides dogs. The plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear. Maybe the series inmproves after this book. I'm not taking that chance	0

261357	Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead	0

276174	I bought this book for my CCNP recertification.  I ran into a bunch of stuff on the exam that was not covered in this book or was in greater detail than was covered by this book. I used Sybex books before on my original CCNP certification and I passed.  If I try to recertify, it won't be with one of those books.  I'll use Cisco Press.  Live and learn.	0
282575	This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason.	0
285081	This book is pure fiction, nothing more. The problem is that is presented as fact - albeit little known fact.	0
292134	Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears.	0
300497	It was amazing when i read this, how self centered and morally wrong this man was. It makes me sick to my stumach to read it. This was nothing more then glorifing his looting and murdering in cold blood. If you have a chance skip this one and read somthing like "Company Commander" or "Band of Brothers" somthing worth while	0
308500	This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.	0
311902	I know that as a wolf-lover I am a bit biased, but I would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect.  You see, in this story, three children are left alone.  A wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in, because he wants to eat them.	0
316541	I finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, I would have quit after page 20. I wasn't interested in the story or writing. I didn't find the story grotesque; I've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but I just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. He went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  We learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. His actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  I know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  I wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure	0
326117	This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased	0
336218	Casual book browsers who stumble across Braden's book, "The Isaiah Effect," might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title: that there exists some mystical, unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques, research, and understanding. I, as one such browser, had briefly read about the so-called "Bible Code" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related. With my interest piqued at the title and the book description, I delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed Isaiah's "precise instructions" of prayer. I wanted to know exactly what Braden claimed to have stumbled upon.	0
340689	AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.	0
347977	As a fervent admirer of Peter Bart's previous books, The Gross and Who Killed Hollywood, I was extremely disappointed with this one.  I feel he sold out by flacking for Peter Guber, whose exploits were richly detailed in the book "Hit and Run".  There's really nothing new in here, and you'd be well advised to avoid it	0
349953	As a Certified Information Systems Security Professional, I can definitively state that this book does not cover everything that needs to be covered or in any depth whatsoever. I got this book based on the glowing reviews I found here, and I'm at a loss as to why these reviews would have recommended it.	0
359310	The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.	0

381487	This book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics, etc. To me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.	0

414947	The problem with this book is that it does not explain the mathematics well.  The author connects the unsolvable equation with group theory but does not provide any way for the reader to understand exactly what it is that is wrong with the equation.  Why could the equation not be solved?  There is a reason for this fact, and the mathematical theory explains it well--but not this book.  Perhaps a mathematician will write a book explaining why the 5th degree equation cannot be solved in general.  The reason is the subject of Galois theory taught in high-level mathematics courses but explainable in a popular book; but apparently not in this one	0
421113	Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.	0
425622	The author had a great idea, but he cherry-picked the available info about Superman and the writers to get the book to make sense. For example, Superman was originally written as a metaphor for Jews during WW2. Two Jewish guys, right at the end of WW2, write a story of a man that has to leave his homeworld b/c it's destroyed... etc, etc.	0

440979	This is the worst novel that I have ever read by a major author.  I have read a couple other Alex Cross novels and I did not find them to be awful at all.  They weren't very good but they kept me turning the page.  While I was reading this dreck I began to get a sense of Patterson's work ethic.  He sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it.  One maybe two chapters per day I suppose, and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result.  Not a snowball's chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren't written by Patterson.  I'm done. Don't waste your time.  Really	0
445168	I'm on page 110 of this book. The book has 220 pages. I'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person I am angry with. I bought this book because I have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But, it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). Part 1 tells us what a "grievance" is. It tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is  I ALREADY KNOW what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I reached "Part 2", entitles "Forgiveness" I thought FINALLY.... but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so far I can't agree with any of the positive comments. I have a great degree of respect for Stanford University, I went to high school across the street from Stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. Is it fair of me to write a review of a book I have not finished? No... but I'm afraid to continue reading it. I'm already angry and to buy a book that I thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, I don't feel is not all that fair either......	0
448084	I'd never read Berry before, but as far as I can tell, this brief collection of six essays and lectures sticks to familiar territory. However, it's probably not the best entry point for people who are newcomers to his realm. There are two related problems with the book: one of presentation, and one of tone. The problem with presentation is that the pieces are so short that there's no room for specifics. So, while one might be more or less in accord with the broad strokes of Berry's vision, there's no detail to back it all up. The problem with tone is that from the very first page the reader feels like they are being lectured at. Of course, some of the pieces are lectures, but there's a certain condescension that runs throughout the book. It comes out when Berry uses certain words such as the three As of "appropriate", "authentic" and "adequate". When these are used ( as they often are), there he's obviously made some kind of value judgment, but the reader is never let in on it. The end result of the two flaws is that the reader feels like a hectoring argument is being made without any supporting logic -- which ultimately smacks of preaching to the choir.	0
458449	"Ha ha ha hah ha hah!"  That's Stirling laughing all the way to the bank.  Or at least I hope that's what he is doing.  But sadly I suspect he more likely feels his Wiccan/SCA/DnD-infused vision of a post-apocalyptic society is a reasonable, nay, likely path we'll follow should selective physical laws break down.  Quick!  Stop me!  I feel the need to wave my sword, sing a Gaelic song, and break out my cauldron!  The genre requires we make a leap of faith.  And as a fan of the genre, I do so willingly.  But having made the leap, it is annoying at best to be forced through this "Tolkein as faith" drivel.  But as I will likely read the entire series (remember, I love the genre) I have to hope that Stirling leans towards the "thanks for the buck buddy" and is himself laughing at us all.  But a picture is worth a thousand words and his mug on the inside cover tells me he believes this nonsense!	0
465329	It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull	0
470194	I really thought I would be able to learn about the Philadelphia Project from this book, considering the title. However, the actual project doesn't make an appearence until the last chapter. The entire book focuses on ideas that may or may not have contributed to a project that may or may not have taken place.	0
474282	This book is outdated for the 21st century. The basics are there and in great detail but most of the information is useless for today	0
477899	I might have been expecting too much, but I was disappointed with this book. I did not learn anything on Dark Magick per se. The first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, Goths, Vampires, Lost Souls, the Collective Unconscious, Dark Deities, Satanism and some other stuff. The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick	0
483227	I must say I was dissapointed with those 2 stories. First story is so far from reality (I know, I know, sometimes we want to get away-but not That Far!!!) I couldn't read even half of the 2nd story...It was written very poorly. Sometimes I felt like something just wasn't enough, at times opposite - like it was way too much! Anyway, I wouldn't recomend bying this book..	0
497285	I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority	0
501399	Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding	0
506534	I had to buy this book for a class.  It is an extremely boring read and I struggle to keep myself awake while reading it (as does the rest of the class I am told).  It does tell you about Dreamweaver though and I suppose that is its purpose.  One thing that I do not like is the way the author is constantly bashing Internet Explorer and other isp's.  His personal opinions are a real turn-off and unnecessary	0
510701	In his recently published history, The Whiskey Rebellion, William Hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century Whiskey Rebellion in Western Pennsylvania. What Hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of Howard Zinn. He has an axe to grind, and by the end Alexander Hamilton is the devil incarnate, and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the American Revolution to its necessary conclusion.	0
524982	F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life	0
532905	I was intrigued by his &quot;The End of History.&quot; I thought his  &quot;Trust&quot; was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my  masters thesis and doctoral dissertation. I only hope this latest book is a  disruption in an ongoing chain of good books. In the end, &quot;The Great  Disruption&quot; is a down right silly book. It has a lot of usefull data  but Fukuyama's humanistic ideology clouds it all. All his empirical data  and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion:  that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good.  Fukuyama proves that the moral consensus -- the social capital -- of the  earlier era has been wiped away. That crime has sky-rocketed and that the  apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high  incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men. Then he turns  around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped  because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to  rebuild social capital. He doesn't bother to deal with societies -- like  Ethiopia -- that have never been able to build up enough social capital. He  doesn't really look any further back in history past about 1950. His  generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken  into account the big picture of history. He thinks (based on his ideology  of human goodness) that things just have to get better. If he had studied  Pitirim Sorokin for a really big picture of history, he would know better.  People can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does Fukuyama but  they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to  make generalizations about long-term historical cycles. For that, I would  recommend Robert W. Fogel's &quot;The Fourth Great Awakening and the Future  of Egalitarianism.&quot; Fogel, a Nobel prize winner, has all the optimism  of Fukuyama but with the history to back it up	0

555710	Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order	0
560022	Very politically manipulative primer that only gives 5/8 of the story. I add 1/8 because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism, but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate, but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run. There is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained, but too often this reference becomes a one-sided sermon for free trade. These are the same deceptions that Robert Reich started pushing under Clinton. Repubs kept the song going without missing a beat. Most of both Dem and Repub reps support neoliberal policies - the rich get richer in both parties. Feel free to read to learn about terms, just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path	0
565984	I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children.  I liked the story but the chapters were way too long.  My children kept asking, "how many more pages?"	0
570244	I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost	0

584408	If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his &quot;Official Religious Disclaimer&quot; at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading	0
590006	Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships	0
598021	It's always easy to criticize somebody's personal choises when it comes to the movies and the stars, but this book is dedicated to the most unforgettable ACTRESSES and not STARS of the studio era. So it comes pretty natural to ask : Is Esther Williams such an unforgettable actress that the author had to overlook Margaret Sullavan? Was Grace Kelly's talent so overwhelming to forget that Miriam Hopkins had such an individuality in the acting process that she kept on working with such directors as Lubitsch, Wyler, Mamoulian, Hawks and Vidor to stunning results? What was wrong with Mary Astor's acting  and what is right with Kim Novak's ?	0
600397	I thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've baked from it so far.  I was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.	0
603125	The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book.	0
606167	I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it	0
0451149165:say_it_with_me_everyone...__"i'm_not_rand":shane_jenkins	Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.	0
0201619180:not_what_i_expected!:winston_d._chambers	This book bears litthe relevance to the 'original' fourth edition book of the same name. There is no coordination with the text.

It was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports, most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing.  They openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english.  Just as well, long rambling thaughts that don't form conclusions.  Not what I wanted or needed.  It actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go	0
1593553366:done_with_dean:abtcabe	I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off.

This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.	0

0786226749:a_mess_of_storytelling:jesse_gruber	Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books.

0226869024:outdated_look_into_the_future:bob_neubauer	Reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it.

However with the  recent boom of billiards into mainstram american society, many of his  observations and conclusions are dated if  not false. Te book just goes to  many places, crime, pornography, etc. and fails what it set out to  originally acomplish. Furthermore, I find it quite unusal that the author  chooses to contend a great deal of current ideologies toward billiards . Is  this not a sociological perspective, or an historical editorial.As a  college student, and a sociology major, the author fails to win my support  from his argument. All in all, quite disapointing as I found it at my local  bookstore and the cover looked interesting.

This alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why B was the right answer, and why A, C, and D were wrong, but leaves that status of E wholly to the realm of mystery.  The practice test sent out with the GRE registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  I actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  Don't buy this book.

0060952970:ophelia_may_have_spoken,_but_what_about_the_others?:"aikabunny"	I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read "Reviving Ophelia", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may "make feel less alone", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it	0

Square character telling us about his flat, two dimensional world is not thought provoking, its just confusing!  Trying to imagine life in two dimensions is truely mind numbing.  I mean I understand what Flatland would be like, but only after I carefully think out what Mr. Square is saying.  I spent more time trying to comprehend the two dimensional reality of Flatland than I do enjoying the story.  Not very interesting at all, even two stars is being generous	0
0140112405:historical_proof_of_left_wing_vietnam-era_propaganda:true_blue	After reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his PR teams ability to hide the &quot;true&quot; Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  He proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw debating Kennedy on TV in 1960.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  All historians admit that JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas.  Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK the family man and the idealist.  JFK exploited the Missile Gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to the Mafia!  Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like a true selling of the President.  'Selling of the President' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s	0

157322233X:200_pages_of_unedited_notes:royal_diasticutis	This is the worst book of Shakespeare criticism I have ever read.  Bloom makes no attempt to link one paragraph to the next.  It reads like 30 years of lecture notes piled together haphazardly, handed to a graduate student, and entered into a computer over a weekend.  He contradicts himself several times.  I donated my copy to the library as soon as I was done reading it, so I cannot cite the pages where the contradictions occur; but several times I recall reading a passage where Bloom had just said the exact opposite a few pages earlier.  To make matters worse, he even says the bard contradicts HIMself.  He points to supposed paradoxes regarding Hamlet's age, stating that his seeming age does not jive with textual evidence that would put his age at about 30.  Apparently the point is that if Shakespeare contradicts himself, so can Bloom.  Bloom ignores the obvious conclusion that Hamlet is a slacker.  He has not grown up yet.  That is why his parents tell him to come home from school and not to waste his time as a professional student when he should be learning how to run a kingdom.  Some of the book's observations are interesting, but they are glossed over and presented as a random jumble from Bloom's notes.  Interespersed between the passages scribbled down from Bloom's lectures are outbursts where Bloom reminds us that Shakespeare is without any question whatsover the greatest writer, in verse or prose, who ever lived.  Bloom is a great critic when he still tries, but in this book he was not even trying	0
1593075502:bprd_is_wonderful!:n._k._hill_"stygian"	I've been following BPRD since the very beginning and feel that I can say with all sincerity, that this series gets better and better with each new story!  The TPB's are absolutely the way to go if you don't frequent comic stores (which I do).  So do yourself a favor and purchase all of the TPB's, kick back in an easy chair with a stock of time set aside, and enjoy these bad boys to your hearts content	0
0310251109:ugh.:g._schmidl_"gschmidl"	The unbelievable awfulness of the prose makes Dan Brown look like Borges in comparison. Naming characters "Guard One" just shows you don't even try to care. The plot is so hair-brained that just thinking about it gives me a headache -- I just learned, to my horror, that there are two sequels to this that turn the entire thing into a treatise on the end times. I'd have loved to see what a capable author could have done with the premise, but it's been ruined forever by... this. Somewhere, Baby Jesus is crying	0
1740592654:belarus,_huh?:skip_klauber_"a_history_lover"	What to say about Belarus? Well, we spent the day the White Russkis commemmorate the end of WWII there, so I've seen it in all of its "grandeur". Not much to recommend it, go and see Belarus if you missed out on the post WWII East European dictatorships, because Belarus is the last of its kind. A genuine personality cult around the president runs politics, and you can get a feel for what it was like in 1970's E. Europe. Guess what- you will not like it. Take some pics of Minsk & move on to Moscow. And if you can find a decent hotel in Minsk, you've done better than my wife and I did.	0

0439355338:not_a_lot_of_content:j._stout	This book contains reproducible mini-books, bingo cards, flash cards, some word search puzzles and fill-in activities.  In my opinion, the fill-ins are a bit too challenging.  I even had trouble with them.  The only thing in this book really "worth it" that I couldn't make as well myself, are the mini-books.  The mini-books each contain several different sight words, so they seem to me to be more effective for review of words the student has already learned than in the initial learning of them	0
1566252172:this_is_a_book_of_fiction,_no_mention_of_craps_strategy:chalon_jackson	This book is more of an advertisement for Scoblete's other books, his writing buddies other books, and his golden touch craps siminar. This book gives no mention of how the reader can acomplish dice control, which is the reason I bought this book. The book is rather a collection of stories. Scoblete tells of people he met playing craps but he forgets to tell how to play craps. It would not surprise me at all if the characters in the book are made up, especially the Captain, the authors ultimate craps hero. I couldn't even finish this book. It was boring and repeated the same type of uninteresting stories all the way through, and left the reader with no knowledge gained. If you are interested in a good casino book I recomend something by Avery Cardoza or a book published by his company	0

I wanted to read this travel book about this famous city, but after a few chapters, I wondered where the book was going to.  After the final chapter, I still do not know what the author's intentions was with this book.  Perhaps I don't read too many travel books.  Obviously the city means a lot to the author, but she did not express it clearly in her writing.  I was scratching my head at the end, and wondering what I read.	0
0787119555:interesting,_but_not_gripping:anon_"ymous"	I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him.   I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.	0

This book is one long advertisement for UDAP!!  My book was actually misprinted, missing 50 pages right in the middle.

0812973763:"days_of_our_lives"_for_the_starbucks_crowd:jody_tresidder_"jody"	Other reviewers have taken pains to outline the "plot" of this baby boomer bodice ripper. Suffice it to say author Kathryn Harrison, scrupulously adhering to some private conviction that "more is better" , offers estrangement between identical twins, loss of a child, incest, paternity confusion, mid-life crisis and spiteful erotomania as it crops up in the life of one understandably confused New York shrink. This reader was aching for the hero, Will, to book himself onto Jerry Springer while feeling immensely shortchanged by lines from Ms Harrison like "It's just...it's...What is it? Will doesn't have a word for what he feels." (Perhaps the character lacks the emotional vocabulary to communicate with the reader: the author, however, should not. In any case, those are lousy, lazy sentences among so many examples.)	0
1841955566:i_wish_i_were_drinking_coffee_elsewhere:karm	When I first picked up Drinking Coffee Elsewhere, I was excited to have the chance to read something that so many people seemed to enjoy.  And, truthfully, it's not a horrible book.  It is entertaining, the style works, etc.  On that note, if you're looking for a fun read and don't plan on thinking about it too much, then by all means, get it.  My problem with the book is that it doesn't deserve all the acclaim it's getting-- if you want something that breaks boundaries or adds a new voice to the current socio-political situation of America, this is not your book.	0
1573240397:a_bit_of_silliness_for_the_couch_potatos:	Someone gave me this book as a gift -- why, I have no idea. This book is about as intelligent as a TV sitcom, about as funny as a TV sitcom, and generally at the level of a TV sitcom. I found it neither funny, inspiring nor interesting. It is, in the final analysis, proof that any book that purports to be about &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;outrageous&quot; women will immediately sell thousands of copies, regardless of the piffle between the covers, and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything. Probably best for teenaged girls who don't read much. It's no worse than TV, I guess	0

0834003465:this_is_a_review_of_love_and_peace...:carnage	I will not lash out against anyone, and I will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious, ostentatious egotism. That said, let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes Jesus of Nathareth's solutions extremely difficult to accept. First off, it doesn't do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of Jesus's morals in general terms. If we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us, then we must provide a trenchant analysis of Jesus's codices. The key point here is that Jesus's older analects were deluded enough. His latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale. Jesus's peuplade appears to be growing in number. I indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet I keep reminding myself that Jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations, circumvent any further litigation, and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death -- all by trumping up a phony emergency. His desire to control your bank account, your employment, your personal safety, and your mind is the chief sign that he's a slaphappy caitiff. (The second sign is that Jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo "treatment" to cure my "problem".)	0

1557255059:the_emperor_has_no_clothes?:play_fair	The author writes a book that does give you a mental workout while giving valuable insight into the theological/philosophical foundations of the emerging confession. There is value in that. I look forward to reading part two, the liturgical ideas section. The emerging church is keen on praxis, but the theological underpinings of this book in part one reminds me of past mistakes within Christendom, which I had hoped we were past.	0
0895262258:a_biased_account:celtia	The Venona Secrets is a deceptive book. It tries to pass itself off as an objective portrait of Soviet spying in the US, but by the time the reader is a third of the way in it becomes apparent that the authors are more interested in smearing "Liberals" than in painting a true portrait of their subject. Although the information the authors provide is interesting, the biased and heavy-handed way it's presented negates whatever scientific value it might have. For example, the authors insist that J. Robert Oppenheimer was working for the Soviets (they call this a "fact") yet they present absolutely no proof that Oppenheimer was anything more than an idealistic, naive man who couldn't keep his mouth shut and whose only contribution to the advancement of Communism in America was money to the CPUSA. The book is full of these so-called "facts" with little to nothing to back them up. The authors praise Joe McCarthy and claim in the last chapter of the book that he was barely a factor in the anti-Communist hysteria of the 1940's and 1950's, ignoring the fact that MCCarthy capitalized on fears of Communism obscenely and was wrong far more than he was right about who was and was not loyal. McCarthy's methods of terrorism and hypocrisy in running hearings that could have been chaired by Stalin are completely overlooked, as are the innocent lives he destroyed in his smear campaign. The authors also praise Senator Henry Jackson as some sort of all-American crusader against Communism, not even mentioning that all of Jackson's anti-Communist attacks were motivated by his virulent anti-Semistism and hatred of blacks. Overall this book is nothing more than an indictment of Liberal ideology -- one can simply hear the disdain for Liberals dripping from the authors' prose -- and should not be given much credence by scholars not interested in right-wing propaganda who want an objective account of Venona. The authors have sacrificed their credibility for their Conservative agenda; they deserve not to be taken seriously	0

B0000AA9JD:one_of_the_most_braindead_plot_elements_in_history:duane_thomas	The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book.

What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.	0
0915950839:judgmental!:roni	The advice in this book is solid and appropriate for most kids. However, the writer's attitude is judgmental. If you are buying this book, it's probably because your child's eating has not gone as smoothly as you'd like. For most of us, a lot of our parental self-esteem is wrapped up in this issue. So it just makes no sense to act as if it's usually the parent's fault - why alienate and beat up your target audience???? Plus, while I'm sure that some parents contribute to kids' eating issues, plenty of kids are just born more sensitive! If you can read between the lines and get to the take home message without letting her attitude get to you, more power to you - otherwise, go elsewhere.	0
0134744799:useful_but_over_priced:"tseant"	A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries	0
1402569858:there_is_life_outside_virginia:c.m.	I have progressively become more and more disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's books in the past decade. Her early books were utterly magnificent; now, she rarely if ever deviates from her favorite (and by now, utterly boring) themes -- Southern manners, horse bloodlines, and foxhunting. Blessedly, "Whisker of Evil" was foxhunting-free, but suffered from a heavy-handed overload of the previous two. Rita Mae Brown would be wise to remember that there is a big world outside of her corner of Virginia, and many of us have grace, manners, and respect for others -- and we don't take kindly to being told that only Virginians understand these things. That's just simply not true.	0

1581348061:very_disappointing.:loves_to_read_"lee"	I found it to lean very heavily towards a hierarchal view of the relationship between men and women.  Men are to rule, and women are to submit to that rule.  The authors appear to see women as perpetual children who need to be under the continual domination of men, rather than as adults who deal with men on an adult level.  I suggest anyone who reads this books should also read "Discovering Biblical Equality."  It gives another view of how the Christians world see the role of women	0
0807829587:evans_should_update_his_book!_the_south_is_no_longer_'fiddler_on_the_roof'!:helene_hoffman	I am a Jew living in a college town in Mississippi for the past 5 years. I was born & raised in the North. I think Evans should rename his book "Fiddler on the Roof in the South". His book is a very nostalgic look back at Jewish history - as it was in the past here. It's very much: the southern Jews were all so happy, they all fit in and were accepted, etc. He does cite a few instances where they had problems - but these usually involved us 'Yankee Jews', like the instances when a few (Yankee)Rabbis in the South fought for civil rights.	0

Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him.

0060393688:you_have_to_be_a_dave_navarro_fan_to_enjoy_this:william_d._tompkins	This book is for the diehard Dave Navarro fans only. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the use of  instamatic photos in the book is creative. The text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist. Neil Straus approached writing The Dirt with Motley Crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested.

0765304740:a_disappointment_after_xenocide:bickazer_"maplestory"	Good, but it simply wasn't actionous enough. I don't mind having no action in a book (otherwise how else could I love Foundation so much?), but Children was a book that NEEDED to have action in it. Unfortunately it didn't really. Too much philosophical babble that I had to re-read to get it. Slightly reminiscent of Card's later Shadow series with the sheer amount of internal monologue. Too much about Jane, not enough about the pequeninos and barely anything about Ender, which annoyed me. To my shock Ender's death did not really impact me in any way, beyond--"Huh? Wait...Ender is dead?", so little was his role in the book. He probably talked for only about twelve pages altogether.	0

The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story.	0
0714651788:this_is_soviet_propganda,_not_history!:devl's_advocate_"rsha"	Erickson, a notorious communist and bogus half baked historian is not to be trusted with his works, all based on bogus, doctored and unrelaible Soviet semi fictions intended to advance the cause of Bolshevik invincability.	0
0807262013:series_crashes_with_third_book_-_be_warned:talia	After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.	0
0590473700:untitled:	I read this book for a book report, and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it. Because I was forced to read this book I now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story. The steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses. 1 star for one very boring book	0

0761131787:if_i_followed_this_i_would_feel_deprived:rachel	While I think the basics of the book are good, I don't like how fat-free items are treated as always being the best option.  I did much better on the South Beach Diet, where good fats in moderation is emphasized as well as natural foods.  Fat is what makes us feel satisfied.  After years of trying to diet by limiting fat, it was a revelation to me I could lose weight without feeling hungry and deprived.  An omelette made of egg whites and fat-free cheese is not at all satisfying and not necessary.  Secondly, many foods are altered in a negative way to make them low-fat.  I just noticed this week that Cool Whip lite has high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated vegetable oil as two of it's top ingredients.  This can't be better for you than actual cream.  I also prefer the book "French Woman Don't Get Fat", which emphasizes enjoying food by eating smaller portions of good, natural food when it's in season.  The pleasure of good food makes you stop thinking diet and start thinking about lifestyle.  I feel that the G.I Diet is oversimplified and written to appeal to an audience that has never thought about eating right before.  I think this book is  about the mechanics of healthy eating when the cause of overeating is a lot more complicated.  It certainly can help get people on the right track, but I think there are better books available.	0
0879058307:title_doesn't_fit_subject_matter:	This is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing, as you can't browse the book before purchasing it.  &quot;Camping Activities for Kids&quot; is very light on the  &quot;activities.&quot;  It does a good job of laying out items that should  be brought along on ones first camping trip, but falls short on suggesting  outdoor activities for kids.  The activities that are suggested are a  little simplistic.  For example, &quot;laying sticks apart from one another  and pretending it's a river, and then have the kids jump over it and  playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls.&quot;  I was hoping  for more endepth activities.  If it's your first time camping this books  okay, but if you've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the  book falls short so look for something else	0

0931055962:seven_times_the_sun:	Seven Times The Sun is not for everyone. It could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life. But the songs, poems and traditions offered in Shea Darian's book are hokey and contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. None of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. But I'm just thankful Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy	0
0395623642:religious_stew:brian_j._ivey_"bivey"	I am an elementary school teacher previewing this book in order to find a developmentally appropriate text for a study of religion. I am not religious and I strive to take a learner's stance and a scholarly approach to any unit of study that I present to my students. Betsy and Guilio Maestro have written other fabulous books on several topics; books that I have made available to my students for their research because they were accurate and presented without bias. This particular work unfortunately is neither. Their gesture was genuine and gracious, an example of the tolerance they wanted to promote. No deity need take offense; all were included in the pantheon of possibilities. It is however filled with inaccuracies and contradictions and finally a statement of belief by the authors.	0
0385412371:not_the_"the_silly_book":"wlittlejohn"	For all of you looking for that favorite book "The Silly Book", join my club (not literally).  The book that has the ode to Boodleheimer was written by Stoo Hample not Babette Cole.  I have been searching for this book for years.  Good luck everyone, and let me know if you find an extra copy for sale	0

0786230800:i_didn't_even_finish_it.:	I really didn't enjoy this book.  I am half Italian-American, and I've read a few books about growing up in an Italian-American family in an effort to learn about my roots.  I have also read several books about 2nd generation Americans struggling to find their identities while caught between what is &quot;normal&quot; and their immigrant parents.  I normally enjoy such books, but not this one.  I know that life wasn't always a bowl of cherries for these familes, but this book makes it seem as if it was absolutely horrible.  Yet, I couldn't find anything about the daughters' lives that are really that bad or even different from many people's lives in this country.  Where is all the anger coming from?  I really don't know.  This book is dark and depressing.  Some say it is funny at times, but I didn't think so.  I couldn't even bring myself to finish it	0
3294	I am ordering copies for all 23 middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the Milwaukee Public Schools system. We will use Wheatley's book as the primary resource  for our professional growth at our MPS Middle School Principals  Collaborative institute August 9-11, 1999. We are not just concerned with  reform; we seek renewal as well. Wheatley provides the basis. She notes  that Einstein said that  a problem cannot be solved from the same  consciousness that created it. The entire book is a marvelous exploration  of this philosophy	1
8039	I have been studing leadership for over 15 years both by reading and experience.  I consider this book to be the best book I have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity.  It also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems. I found that as President of my congregation I was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary.  It was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything. (That would have been impossible anyway) I found that he described President Lyndon Johnson as a successful leader (civil rights) and unsuccessful leader ( Vietnam).  His discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me.    If you want to discuss the book with others there is an on-line book study at the Work and Worship Institute website. I found it was a good way for me to get more from the book. This is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society.	1
12512	Zig Ziglar has done it again. As an author myself of sales books,  I realize sales is about so much more than just having the 'gift of gab,' and fast talking. It's about asking the right questions and listening to the right answers. It's about not just being a consultant to others, but being a consultant to yourself. It's recognizing you are in the most honorable profession there is. Zig's theories exemplify this.	1
20675	I loved this book. The food was really good and fast (which is good because I have a very packed schedule). Also great if you're on a budget. The recipes have variations so I could eat different things but not have to buy a whole new set of ingrediants.	1
27613	Bob Quinn is definitely one of the most profound writers on change in this era. But his work is not for the faint of heart because he challenges each of us to start change initiatives in the place we'd least like to go -- inside ourselves. I found this an incredibly powerful book. I've used sections of it with my "change management" classes for several years and I know it has a tremendous impact on students, who like most managers have grown up unconsciously believing that change always needs to start with the other guy. If you want a simple formula for change, don't buy this book. Although it is full of practical, actionable ideas, "Change the World" addresses change at a profound level that asks readers to reflect seriously on what they stand for. It's a very difficult but rewarding assignment	1
34624	This book is NOT about ALL people. It is about gifted (in this case that means sensitive) children that are misused to feed their parents narcissism. Most children are not that sensitive and hence not suseptible to that specific abuse.	1
41123	This book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low-income communities of color in New York City. Necessary reading for those who still do not  realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which  marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further  fragment and disenfranchise them	1
50659	I bought this book just recently and was really touched (and cried) by the whole experience that Gus had went through. He has lost the one friend that gave him a second chance (Stephanie) and without her, he could've been out there on the street again. Overall, it's a good book to read and I always believe that man and animals can be best friends and learn from one another, this book is a genuine prove.	1
54503	Ever since starting on the SIMPLE ABUNDANCE journey with Sarah Ban Breathnach's first book, I have longed for an opportunity to learn one-on-one from the Queen of simplicity and authenticity. We may not be able to meet Sarah face-to-face, but now anyone can enjoy a workshop  atmosphere in the comfort of her own home. Women caught up in the  day-to-day deluge of deadlines, appointments, and commitments can now curl  up with a pillow and excavate their authentic self. I highly recommend this  book to anyone who wants to savor their life instead of living in a blur	1
63441	I read the good Doctor's book Eat to Live and then bought China Study which he talks a lot about in this book.  Then I bought this book being curious after reading a few other books on fasting and this book wins hands down though I do feel he's being overly cautious about doing long fasts of more than 5 days without medical supervision to protect himself as people have been doing long fasts for centuries without medical supervision and doing just fine and since finding a Doctor in even a large community is rare indeed one is left to do this on their own.	1
72944	I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula.	1
83676	Brilliant. Sam Harris portends the calamitous pathway that irrational, divisive thinking (religious & secular) will cause. He also spells out the necessary suggestions and goals for humans to evolve to the point where we're globally not at risk of suffering due to anachronistic prejudices	1
89971	I really had no faith before this book.  Not really sure what I should of beleived.  But this book def changed my point of view and it is shocking! Eveything just seemed ot come together and to me it just makes complete sense and I feel that this book is entirely true.   It would be great to see the world come together in world peace if they only knew the truth.  I knew the government covered stuff up but I had no idea to the extent they would goto to keep their undreground society such a secret and ruthless and would stop at nothing.  He doesn't say it straight out but the way it is described protrays this secret rogue group to be the illumnati with unlimited funding to carry out their evil intentions.  Greatest book I ever rea	1
97074	Once again Mr. Updike delivers an insightful story of life in suburbia and what lurks in the hearts and minds of men and women  - love, lust, betrayal, self doubt.  Villages relates Owen's life as only John Updike can.  The last chapter gets a little too long and not as enjoyable as the rest of the book, but I will certainly recommend it to all my friends	1
103272	Beginning with the introduction, I was taken on a fabulous journey. These gifted authors write a wonderful narrative.  Lande's Snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion. They are as engaging as any short story in the New Yorker!	1
107927	This book is a very good study into what happen to the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel. Mr. Capt did a Great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in Assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the Assyrians which is called the House of Omri. This book is very in depth and very informative. I also noticed a person left one star because Mr. Capt did say anything about the Jews. Of course the Jew's wouldn't be metioned they weren't taken into exile until 586 bce, and that was by Babylonia and not Assyria. When reading about the Ten Tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not Jews. Over all I give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid Bible reader intrested in research	1
118330	What an absolute lifesaver! As parents of two kids- (one dreamer and one dynamo) we had run through the endless &quot;experts&quot; in our town for answers. This is a priceless resource for anyone who wants to stand up with facts to experts in both the medical and the school-related fields. It gives reasons for behavior and what works ,and more importantly, why what a lot of people want you to do won't work! I have given it to each teacher/specialist who works with my children. Her advice does work and your special bright child will blossom with it. It is written in an engaging and segmented format. Be sure to read the part addressing whether or not to medicate. Perfect for carpool wait times as most parents of these bright and energetic kids don't get any other time to sit still	1
127339	Published in 1986, Dr. Deming "Out of the Crisis" seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in American management mentality. Two main subjects are discussed in the book. The first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations, the second, relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way American management operates. 14 core points are suggested by Dr. Deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods.	1

155083	If a book makes me look forward to mid-life - I am all over it! This book was actually required reading for my course study in human development - what a find!  Here, Harvard researcher and bestselling author, Joan Borysenko, takes the cycles of a woman's life and divides them into 7 year increments. Along the journey, she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging.?That's a Big 10-4, Ms. Borysenko! I find myself constantly at odds with the "beauty" images that the media gives us.  I mean, come on, why 'o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society?	1
167018	If you haven't read this book, I would make it TOP PRORITY! This book is fantastic! There hasnt been anything close to it yet. She is an outstanding writer and produces wonderful stories! Better grab a tissue, its a tear-jerker	1
175397	Having spent five years trying to establish an open-source software platform standard, in retrospect it would have been awfully nice to have had this book.  If you're going to compete with the big commercial firms you have to be comparable to or better than they are in as many areas as possible	1
180840	I enjoyed this book immensely.	1
189458	Thank you for sharing Laci and your story with me.  This book is superbly written and shares with the reader a Mother's love for her daughter and angst over her murder.  How tragic to lose Laci.  How disgusting & heartwrenching what you had to  endure since Laci went "missing".	1
195479	The book and accompanying DVD are being used in a class I am taking on Photoshop Elements 4.  Both of them make it much easier to understand what 4 is capable of and how to use the program, especially the tools.  Without instruction, complimented by 1 on 1, I would not be able to use even a small percentage of the power of 4. 1 on 1 goes step by step in 12 chapters of "how to" fix, enhance, organize, and share photos	1
201320	Wonderful Text. Helps to rationalize and boost understanding on why Cubans living in Miami have such foreign behaviors in the eyes of the outsider. The author takes you by the hand, and walks you step by step. Absolutely wonderful and did an excellent job at steering clear of any bias	1
203360	This is an excellent, fascinating and insightful read.  Dr Guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this book well.  She wrote it because obviously we need to think about nutrition, cholesterol and excercise, but there are deeper issues too like peoples emotions.  She believes that heart problems can be caused by the stress's in our lives and our emotions - we could litterally die of a broken heart.  Emotional events can weaken heart muscles.  You produce stress hormones when you are upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart.  She talks about this in the book and on the flip side, talks about happy people too and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts.  When we are happy, our hearts beat in a coherent rythym.  She says we have to look at our hearts in various ways.  We need to look at it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional heart, the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep us healthy.	1
213323	Miller knows his subjects (the people) and his subject (their desperation) with a clarity and fearlessness that most people would prefer to avoid.  Viewing his photographs are no easier a task than living  wholly and honestly.  Skinheads, speedfreaks, Tenderloin whores, friends and neighbors.  Lucid, terrifying, and ultimately beautiful photographs from a man of the same qualities	1
217418	`The Savory Way' is an early (1990) book from leading vegetarian cookbook author, Deborah Madison so, as Ms. Madison has a new book on the way, I thought it was high time for me to catch up with her body of work so I can give an informed review of how her new volume fits into her other books.	1
224225	Hacker's Challenge 2 is a sort of practical exam for the Hacking Exposed series. Hacker's Challenge was a terrific book for putting some incident response and forensic skills to use and practicing for the real thing. Hacker's Challenge 2 continues the tradition and should be a must read for anyone who works with network security and incident response. The style of the challenges is fairly entertaining and the plots are so engaging you may not want to put the book down. Its like a best-selling mystery novel for network security techies. It may not affect the quality of the book overall, but I preferred having the authors of the individual challenges identified as they were in Hacker's Challenge. However, you should definitely buy this book!	1
231835	This book is so great and touching. As a mixed race teen this book gave me hope and confidence. It taught me to honest and open. It made me proud to be me. Never has a book made me so convinced that I am great and wonderful  to be multiracial. I thank the author for this awesome book. Anyone who is  biracial should read this book. Not just once, but over and over, marking  the poems and stories that you can most relate to and read them when you  are feeling down on yourself. This is one &quot;must have&quot; book	1
239219	So many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife's little belly, and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever! This book describes to a 'T' how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process, and it does it in a way that is bust-a-gut funny. Before I read this book, I was like "what the heck is wrong with my wife?"  After reading this book, I was more like "Ohhh, I know why she just ripped my head off... she hates the smell of carrots!"  Great book, fast and fun read, a must read for a new dad. I've bought it for every father to be, and they in turn have done the same.	1
243173	Jmaes Joyce takes us on Stephen Daedalus' interior journey from pre-teen as son of a country gentleman to young adult who wanders the streets of Dublin, struggling with sin, salvation, intellect, ambivalence about his homeland, and his father's decline.  It is not a linear path, but then whose is?  The story is not so much about the artist as a young man, but about a young man's journey to artistic sensibility, its pretensions and exhilirations.	1
254878	When I read Alpha Male Syndrome, I saw myself and the many "Alphas" I've worked with in high-tech corporate America.  In some instances I could call out the names of those I'd either worked with or had family relationships or friendships with - based on the Alpha types, strengths and risk behaviors so well defined in this book.   I found the practical tips - encouraging specific change, in those who don't seem open to changing - to be useful, hopeful, encouraging and sometimes even funny.  I may go broke sending Alpha Male Syndrome to my too-many Alpha friends and more importantly to those who work or live with them!	1

275366	I chanced upon this book quite by accident.I am a big fan of books which inspire.This may not be a book which is high on the literary quotient, the writing does get rambling and long winded quite a number of times.But whats truly awe inspiring is its straight up from the heart.Its quite amazing that someone can go through so many emotions in a lifetime and actually make peace with all thats happened in a lifetime.	1
283828	Perhaps it has a lot to do with the book being written in English (or at least it appears to have been, there is no translator listed), but this is by far the most lucid thing I've read by Latour. In a way it's a radical break, he finally embraces his troubled intellectual child Actor Network Theory, stops expecting its meaning to magically emerge from the context and sets forth exploring what it actually is and how it can work.	1
297880	First off, I loved the book cover- spine and all-- one of my all time favorites. It's what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward-facing covers on the store's front table. Then the title, I loved that just as much. Both share the characteristics of being straightforward, to the point, and revealing. Both are perfectly simple. I read most the essays and came to think that a. this guy really does his homework and b. he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi. I constantly begged for my dictionary. It's probably what gets him the press I knew before I picked this up: an intellectual snob. I guess he got that from the Oprah incident. But I also guess that there's lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career. What's up with this culture that it's so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon? The attraction to Franzen's work is that he investigates and reveals- in a binary way: He's researching facts, he's listening to feelings; he's processing both to give an opinion. The best example of this is My Father's Brain in which he relates the Alzheimer induced decomposing of his father's brain. There is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay; as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss. Reading it you sympathize, you empathize and you learn. Equally as insightful are :	1
301486	Paul Johnson has written a 1,000-page book about various and sundry aspects of the years 1815-1830, years in which he rightly claims to find the origins of many aspects of the world as we know it today.  Johnson's chosen foci are certainly broad: he ranges from events in politics and law to music, science, and even opium use.  While almost every page is loaded with fascinating morsels of information that will certainly come in handy when you want to impress people at your next social function, Johnson's roving eye and pen can be disconcerting: he tends to shift topics very quickly and without warning.  Also, while the book claims to be about "world society," Johnson spends the largest part of his time talking about British society -- but he's found plenty of ways to range geographically from the "western" United States (like Kentucky) to China and Singapore.  Throughout, his prose is generally crisp and pleasant to read.	1
307666	This book was recommended to me by several people as I interviewed hiring managers, HR personnel, senior-level employees, and others for my own book on the job market.  By all accounts, my own included, 201 Best Questions is comprehensive, helpful, and tactical, an important read when one is preparing for an interview.  It is not an all-inclusive resource, only interview-targeted, but for what it is, the book is top-notch	1
317349	Yes, it's the bible of cooking.  Its like a degree at the culinary institute.  However, its not an easy book to cook from.  Most recipes refer to several parts of the book for details on how to prepare different parts of the recipe.  So you contstantly have to page back and forth in the book.  Its intimidating for the novice who just wants to cook, but if you really want to learn about cooking then its THE book to have	1
319836	This is Hawking's attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math.  While still not an easy read, it it much easier than the BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME that he wrote for laypeople before this.  A person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book, as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field.  Older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth	1
330926	This book is as close to perfect as you can get. I personally like magical realism and also wanted to learn more about the recent history of India.	1
335195	I first read about this wonderful book on one of the services that provides reading guides for book clubs.  I was intrigued by the premise, and knew I had to buy it.  This is one book that did not let me down!  I was captivated from the moment I began.  I read in greed, hungering for the next diary entry.  I completed it much too quickly, and had to re-read some entries.  I found myself wondering about some of the women.  (Many are still on my mind.)  I am so pleased that book two is in the works.  This is a book that is too good to miss.	1
345153	Thankfully, this is NOT littered with platitudes and meaningless anaologies, the hallmarks of 99% of the latest-and-greatest business books. Especially since it was written in 1999, Moore's is an incredibly insightful and prophetic book on strategy for the high-tech industry. He was predicting cutting edge changes then that are coming into reality today in 2005. The book is much more descriptive than prescriptive though, and is best used as a tool to instigate discussions about corporate strategy, rather than as a checklist for strategic implementation.	1
354698	This book does what it says. It lists low or no cost campgrounds, they may not be where you want to go or fit your mega motorhome, that's what commercial parks are for. I don't know if it is all-inclusive but it certainly has most of the campgrounds that I know of in areas in which I am familiar	1
366498	Be aware that the reviews for a book are displayed not only for one edition, but for all editions under the same title.  The Oxford Philosophical Texts edition of Hume's "Treatise" should be the standard student edition. The Prometheus Books edition is cheap, but it does not include a modern introduction or any study notes. I recommend the Oxford Philosophical Texts version if you want or need more than just the raw text	1
372122	Always looking for new books on this subject as they are few and far between. This book is written by a cop who knows the business. Really like the way its written, funny at times as well as informatove, good read actually enjoyed what can be dry material. Highly recommended	1
377759	I recommend this book highly for anyone who is losing a close family member or friend to illness or who has lost someone and just are having a hard time coming to terms with why	1
387036	His basic thesis is that a liberal empire can be a greatly positive force in the world, and that the United States is already an empire, but that our inablility to acknowledge the fact leads us to waste our opportunities to be the afore mentioned positive force. Ferguson writes that America is plagued by an attention deficit disorder and too much love of the good life. Thus, we get distracted too easily from important events overseas, and when we do try to intervene, we want quick fixes and low costs.	1
395810	Ellen Wright has done it again.  This time, with Meredith Brokaw.  And the two have combined to put together a wonderful array of recipes that are easy to follow and wonderful to serve to guests.  Often at my dinner parties I refer to Ellen Wright's previous books.  But now Big Sky opens a new door to cooking and presents inviting and simple recipes that will have your guests in awe of your skills.  Even for simple family meals, you will find yourself referring to Big Sky time and time again... I don't know what I did before Big Sky was published.  This is a five-star cookbook that everyone should have in their home.	1

402056	I can not put into words what this journal of the truth has done for me as a African-American Male living in the United States of America.  I was introduced to this book by a man of Guyanese decent who knew I needed to read this book.  I have to admit it was a difficult read because my primary education only spoke of American History and there was no mentioning of any African-Caribbean contributors from the "Middle Passage" period.  Now, at thirty-nine many things are clearer to me.  "Roots" and "Beloved" are historic, well-documented treasures and need to be used in educating all children no matter race, creed or color.  To make sure what I read had some semblance of truth while in Puerto Rico I visited a sugar mill in Guanica and my heart just melted.  If you read the book you will understand my feelings.  I became angry because something as simple as not being forthwith with documented history such as this to young minds of American children lead to misunderstandings amongst the masses hailing from Africa, South America, The Caribbean, Asia, United States and Europe.  Eric Williams I know I can not thank you in person because you are no longer here physically but your spirit lives on in your books and you will always be alive everytime one more person reads your book and awaken "Thank You"!  For everyone else read the book it will cleanse your soul and feed your mind.  Once you finish this read "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" by the same author	1
412718	O'Hara is one of the most underrated of American writers. _Rage to Live_  builds a strong character in Grace Caldwell Tate-- her passions are handled  with delicacy and skill and her story is told with a rare combination of  affection and judgement. A good place to begin with O'Hara if you don't  know his work already	1
420299	The story is both true and extremely unique: The Author, who is an Austrian mountaineer and a SS Nazi officer at the same time,  escapes from a British POW camp in India with the goal to go through Tibet to Japan-occupied Burma, to be sent back to Germany, so as not to miss his chance to participate in WWII.  The extreme difficulties of hiding from officials and surviving the wintry elements of the Himalaya mountains make his Burma plan impossible, so he stays in Tibet.  His unthinkable achievements include storming his way into the "Forbidden City" (Lhassa, the capital), gaining employment in the Tibetian Government, becoming a friend of the "God-King" Dalai Lama - an extremely bright, knowledge-hungry teenager, and learning the Tibetian language to the degree which anable him to do live interpretation for Dalai Lana of English-language movies ("Believe me, it is not easy for a German to translate Shakespearian English into Tibetian").	1
426855	As a History major (undergrad) and former high school history teacher, I marvel at Crichton's ability book after book to research a topic down to the bone then flesh it out in an utterly believable and compelling way. For this reason the Great Train Robbery is for me my favorite Crichton work, even though it may lack the polish of Jurassic Park or Congo or one of his more recent books.	1

438308	&quot;Those who write well have more power and therefore have more control over their lives&quot; (p.21).  If this is indeed true then Mem Fox is a very powerful woman!  In the midst of the phonics vs. whole language war being raged in the media, this book is a call for reading and writing teachers to examine their practices and strive for truly purposeful, artful teaching.  Fox's insights into her life as a writer, teacher and mother make this a truly inspiring and intensely challenging read.  I have always believed that to be an effective reading teacher, I must be a reader, able to share my passion for books with my students, but Mem Fox points out that unless I am a writer as well, I will be unable to know the difficulties, fears, hopes and needs of my students as writers.  I plan to thoughtfully explore the forms of writing I use, examine the writing process I go through and share my writing with my students on a more regular basis.  I am convinced that we will all grow from the experience!	1

448821	Always lively and perspicacious, this clever book seeks to solve a seemingly trivial puzzle: while historians have mustered a host of plausible explanations (weapons, diseases, horses, etc.) for why Europeans spread so thickly into North America, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina (the lands Crosby labels "Neo-Europes"), what could possibly explain why the dandelion did so as well? The question doesn't appear so innocuous when it is pointed out that not just the dandelion, but the European housefly, and feral pigs, and a horde of other weeds, pests, crops, diseases and livestock from Europe followed suit. Quite often these organisms, even the domesticated ones, raced ahead of European explorers themselves, rapidly proliferating into vast herds and stands that the settlers themselves could not fathom. Why was this so? Why didn't, say, Australian weeds, their seeds inadvertently shipped back to England, eventually carpet the meadows and fields of Europe? To answer this odd question, Professor Crosby begins his story with Pangaea--the great supercontinent that began to split apart about 200 million years ago into the continents we now have scattered about the globe. These "seams of Pangaea" then forced a radical divergence in the terrestrial flora and fauna of the planet, and set the stage for the equally radical convergence initiated when European mariners crossed these now mid-oceanic seams. Crosby details case after case in each category: weeds, pests, livestock, diseases and crops. He forcefully illustrates how sudden and overwhelming the ecosystem takeover was until the suspense is too much to bear. What is the answer? He drops clues every now and then, and the most explicit one is in the form of a quote that begins one of the final chapters: if weeds are to be defined as those organisms that thrive on the disturbances caused by humans, then humans themselves must be considered the primary weed of all. Here, then is the answer: all the opportunistic fellow-travelers of the European diaspora are exquisitely coadapted to the scale and pace of the continuous ecological disequilibrium characteristic of the Old World civilizations--and they, in turn, furthered and helped generate that very disequilibrium. Together--humans, horses, cattle, pigs, rats, clover, peaches, measles and, yes,  dandelions--comprised a potent self-replicating system, dimly discerned by its contemporaries, that could not be stopped once it spilled across the seams of Pangaea	1

466928	Know when you can start consulting as a sustainable business. Receive a reasonable fee for your services. Be prepared for the pitfalls of operating your own business.  Hear about success stories and business strategies from  practicing computer consultants.  Learn about starting your consulting  business, marketing, contracts, client relationships, and income producing  consulting activities. This book is practical and realistic.  The author  has a negative opinion of Big 5 accounting firms	1
472560	It doesn't sound like the people you list as reasons "not" to read this book, actually read "this" book. There is a big difference, in my opinion, of putting positive affirmations in your mind, versus a witch doctor. And quite honestly, it seems the positive affirmations could and should be used in "conjuction" with medical care. Does it say anywhere in the book to forego medical care, because you will most definitely be healed? No where. So in my opinion, one has to have a "sound" mind, and not view the book as a "cure all" for all the ills in life, but rather a positive way to "enhance" your life. It is just plain stupid to to avoid getting medical care, when you have a terminal illness, or any other illness for that matter. But according to what I gather from the book, you CAN use positive affirmations, and "believe" that you are getting well, to help keep yourself in a positive state, rather than filling your head with negative thinking that you will never get well. Studies aside from this book have PROVEN that a healthy and positive attitude and mental outlook, have done wonders for recovering patients, along with their medical care. Your review did not address any of those people that read this book, because the two examples of people you list, it is apparent they didn't read the book either, (not sure what compelled you to post here?) therefore you are not qualified, in my opinion, to critique this book, as they were using apparently some form of faith healing from a televangelist, did they prescribe drinking snakes blood, too? Anyway, this book in no way says to forgo medical treatment if you are sick, and those that do, probably won't be addressing their medical problem. Can the positive affirmations and power of suggestion help you through your medical crisis? I imagine it can, (studies prove it can) in addition to proper medical treatment. Anyway, you might want to actually read the book, instead of making comments of what happened to "so and so" who didn't even read it or apply it, including yourself.	1

480428	A lot of very useful info in a small book.  I'm less than half the way through and I've already learned enough to make it worth the investment to me.

I'm ordering another copy for a friend today	1

I saw many offers from b&n and other book stores and I found amazon having the best price and received the book on time. the book was in great condition and my fellow students were surprised when they heard the price and the shipping response. i totally recommend this site and book for school. The book was comprehensible and well illustrated.	1
511125	Malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail.  I really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs/matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books.  He almost makes the process seem easy, and maybe it is, IF you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant.  However, much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a "plateau'ed" or "downward spiraling" church that has been around for 100 years.  The principles are easy and make sense IF you have 100% support of the congregation.  That's pretty hard to do in most of the churches I've been in that need strategic planning the most.   That's no fault of Malphurs; the book itself is a great book	1
517706	I'm amazed that people didn't like this book more... I am also a Land Arch student who had it as an assigned book that was rarely actually assigned.  I was thumbing through it in hopes of generating ideas for another class and was amazed at the amount of usable information it contained.  Perhaps it is better digested in chunks instead of the whole.  I found it great as a reference book	1
524183	Elaine Pagels is a wonderful writer.  Her explanation into early Christianity is wonderful.  It is definitely worth the time to read this.  She delves into the politics of the early church, the Passion, the resurrection, as well as the clashes between Gnostic and Orthodox thinking.  Too often, we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available.  She just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another.  If you want to get an idea of who the Gnostics were, read this	1

537257	As China re-emerges as a dominant power in the 21st century, much will hinge on the beliefs of the people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world. Oddly, the fascism of the Communist regime remains largely in place in the era following Mao's disastrous reign, even as capitalism and other Western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge, heavily-populated, and (from a Western perspective)oftentimes strange land. Aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of Christianity in China, as well as introducing readers to the many Chinese Christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country. On a recent trip to China, I was highly impressed by the deep generosity, humility, resourcefulness, strength, perseverance, and kindness exhibited by Chinese of all ages. This spirit hums just below the surface in the stories Aikman tells of the Christian Chinese and their faith. This spirit is also, I believe, one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of Jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many Chinese. Also, those who are concerned that a "Christian China" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a Westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy. It seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly Chinese way	1
542405	I just love this book. It's for anyone who practices no particular "religion". The prayers are simple, in every day language, easily understood like God is speaking right to me.

587135	How would you like to have to perform your own autopsy? That is the conundrum that faces Dr. Maura Isles in Body Double when she returns from a conference in France to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house. The investigation into the murder leads Maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before, and also leads Maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women.	1
588904	The novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the Arthurian legends. They are, in fact, historical fiction at its best. Whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy, but to weave the stories into historic events. The first six novels in the series (that is all I have read, though it appears that there are two or three more) give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the Arthurian legend. But the beauty of the books is in Whyte's prose. A Scottish poet, he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the 1600 between their time and ours.	1
592415	You'll never read this in NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, and NG is all the poorer for it.  P.J. O'Rourke is never politically-correct and he visits places on the planet from which most people would like to escape...the result is a spot on, razor sharp, keenly observed travelogue that is side-splittingly funny, in a tragic sort of way.  O'Rourke has a wonderful way of spotting irony, silliness, and official absurdity, and letting all of the air out of pompous, ill-conceived notions.  In short, he is the UN's worst nightmare.  For anyone who has travelled or ever interacted with any government agency anywhere--especially our own--this book is a must read	1
597947	Great book; it get's you thinking. My kids arre almost out of the nest and they are all I could ask for. Yes, I worked. But not until they were in school, almost always part time and I did not use 'working' as an excuse to not volunteer at school, sports, and generally be in my kids lives. The point is really about your priorities. Do you instinctively put your kids needs first? It's been interesting to see how things have worked out with families in our area. We have a large group of kids who have been together since kindergarten; now they are seniors. You can instantly tell which parents were connected, involved and had their priorities straight. Not all of them stayed home the whole time.	1
600429	This was a fabulous resource for understanding the evolution of the Marian cult. The one weakness of this book is that it did not deal with the pre-Christian origins of the Marian cult. Other resources, however, cover  the evolution of the Anatolian fertility cult of Cybele into the Roman  Magna Mater and later into the so-called &quot;BVM&quot;. The author does a  good job of showing the origins of various aspects of Mariology and  contrasting these developments with Christianity in the West. The author  has done a great service to those who wish to more fully understand the  syncretic process which blended Christianity with various pagan religions  and medeival political structures to create the Roman Catholic Church	1
607835	I thought I was fairly familiar with the Sanibel Island area, but this book definitely gave me new insight.

0867195126:breathtaking!:ryan_mcculloch	An amazing resource to the odd world of Chick collecting.  Mr. Fowler has crafted an exhausting, almost overwhelming guide to all of Chick's works and articles about him.  Everything is cross-referenced to the point of where the reader is nearly overwhelmed with information.  Minute details of publishing histories and changes to individual tracts are documented down to the smallest letter.  The book (presented in a distinctive computer printout style, possibly due to its origins as a self-published work) is packed with charts of pricing info and catalog numbers.  But even casual Chick fans will enjoy the &quot;History of the World&quot; segment, which ties all of Jack's wild theories into a cohesive narrative, and a segment devoted entirely to fun trivia (there's a list of every instance of the term &quot;haw&quot; for instance).  Each tract and comic is described, and info is given on various parodies and rip-offs.  This is a must for all Chick fans (both &quot;saved&quot; and otherwise)	1

A quick review of the table of contents revealed that I had to have this book.  Pelosi begins with the basics, moves into specifics, and then focuses on those special challenges we all face when trying to make our homes beautiful and appealing without spending a fortune. The pictures are gorgeous and inspiring and the author has an ability to write clearly and concisely with a great sense of humor. Whether you are looking for a single design solution or, like me, enjoy reading about interior design, this is the book for you...and it makes a great gift for your friends and family and colleagues and anyone who lives in a home.

It was a little strange but that's to be expected from this author and genre.  That said, it starts off fairly quickly and flows well through most of the book.  It had the curious sense of near-division in that the book almost seemed to be separated into two distinct sections that were not, in my opionion, as well-connected as in many of Koontz's other books.  In addition, the ending seemed a little hasty.  Thus I gave it four rather than five stars.  That said, I would gladly recommend it to a friend as I would most any of this author's work	1

0785707212:indescribable:crystal_c._loh	As gifted a story teller as he is a veterinarian, James Herriot has the rare ability to bring out every emotion known to the human race with a single magical flick of his pen. Every Living Thing is without a doubt one of the crowning achievements of a master, and is possessed by a single, true trait that is difficult to find in many commercial books- every single tale is told straight from the heart. You will never fail to laugh at the hilarious tales and cry at the most poignant moments. If you're an animal lover, or even just have a passing interest in animals, this is a book you will hold on to and re-read until the end of your days. Kudos, James Herriot, you are very much missed	1

Grandfather Twilight is an endearing character that makes you feel warm and safe. This wonderful book is sure to appeal to all ages (preschool to an older adult).  And, it isn't just for bedtime either.	1

But beware to have some knowledge about the basics of evolution before moving on to this book. There's a bit of a steep learning curve when you're not all to familiair with Darwin's brilliant theory. It also gives a nice insight in the way scientists work	1
0312352298:caretaking_and_cooking:_choices_of_a_college_coed:michele_cozzens	This story drew me in at once because of the strong voice and the good writing. It clearly establishes a sense of time and place (modern day Madison, Wisconsin) and offers the "promise" of an intimate look at daily life during the last stages of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease) from the perspective of a personal caregiver. While we learn to understand the struggles of the patient, Kate, this is more about the struggles of a college student known as "Bec," as she travels an emotional path of coming into her own. Author, Michelle Wildgen, fulfills the promise.	1
0394769120:looking_back:future_teacher	I read The Hundred Penny Box when I was in third grade 13 years ago.  Its messages of love and memory have stayed with me and will continue to do so forever.  I have created my own Hundred Penny Box and just made one for a friend's newborn son.  My grandfather was recently diagnosed with altzheimers, an illness I assume that great-great-Aunt Dew suffered from.  I took my ratty old copy of the book to his house over Easter.  We read it together and discussed his own memories over the years.  While his memory is fading, I felt it important to hear them myself, love them, and save them in my own memory as Michael did for Aunt Dew.  I would reccomend this book to any child who is losing a grandparent and anyone who needs a good, heartwarming story	1

1590171462:a_panoramic_and_poltically_sophisticated_history:robert_t._okeeffe	For the English-language reader Wedgwood's book, which has been in print for over sixty years, is still an excellent introduction and synoptic narrative of this lengthy and turbulent period of European history.  It gives brief and judicious biographical sketches of the major political and military actors of three generations:  The principal antagonists at the outset -- Ferdinand II of Austria and Frederick V, Elector Palatine;  the condottieri-style generals - Spinola, von Mansfeld, Tilly, Wallenstein, Piccolomini, Christian of Halberstadt, Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, the duc d'Enghien (Conde); the contentious minor rulers --  Maximilian V of Bavaria, Johann Georg of Saxony; the northern monarchs -- Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adophus of Sweden (and his daughter Christina and prime minister, Oxenstierna); the "spoiler", Cardinal Richelieu; the new Emperor Ferdinand III and his cousin, the warlord Cardinal-Infant Ferdinand of Spain; and many others.  This book is written in a traditional English historian's  prose style that is clear, eloquent and totally lacking the jargon of concurrent and later social and economic histories, while still covering these aspects of the period.  In spite of some reviewers' claims of a "Protestant bias" in her interpretation, the author seems extremely fair when assessing responsibility for the long-running disaster of the war, taking the position that it was the self-serving political interests of  the participants (dynasties, rulers, generals and paymasters) that kept the war going at the expense of the social and economic welfare of the vast majority of inhabitants of Germany and Bohemia.	1

0688175813:surprisingly_sharp:	I read a review of this in L.A. Weekly which said that it was &quot;a lot  of fun&quot; and entertaining in a sort of ironic way, despite the fact  that it became more slapstick at the end.  I read it, and agreed for the  most part, except I felt that the characters were much stronger and wittier  than I had expected and the author seemed more generous to them than I  would have thought from the initial satirical tone.  The ending was a  little over the top, but it was an example of the kind of senseless  fireworks these characters would have to simulate in their own lives.  All  in all, I thought it was a very intelligent and amusing first novel	1

0393974995:truly_one_of_the_best.:	One reviewer claims that this is marred by some of Eliot's unfurtunate preducices. But how come you don't say something like that about O' Henry. We can't just stop reading authers because you we don't like their views. Someone calls hemingway looking forward? If that's looking forward I'de rather look backward. Hemingway has no concept of lyricism what so ever. Most of the people that reviewer named justly loved Eliot. Eliot is not looking nesscarily towards the past, but towards what we have made out of the present. In name of progress, we have destroyed nature and good part of our souls. To call Eliot Conservative at the time he wrote the poem would be redicoulous, the first draft according to one of Eliot's biographers, was absolutly a expression of Relavtism. One critic accused him being a Nihilist.	1
0140070206:dark_redemption,_or_not?_:john_conner_"part-time_professional_student"	IRONWEED by William J. Kennedy was the latest selection for a book club I've recently joined.  The premise of the club is to read a novel and then view the movie (at the group meeting) that was based on the novel.  As I expected, the movie paled in comparison to the book, despite the screenplay being written by Kennedy himself.  Jack Nicholson plays the main character (Francis) and Meryl Streep is his "wanna be" socialite girlfriend (Helen), but this star power doesn't elevate the story beyond what Kennedy had already done in the novel.	1
1842770179:global_women's_movement_without_global_capitalist_background:p._waterman	I have written a lengthier review of this work elsewhere. But I did want to say to potential readers that the Peggy Antrobus book is a brief and welcome introduction to the global women's movement, that as such it fills a long-felt-want, and that it is to be recommended to those new to, unfamiliar with, or who feel they should be allied with, the women's movement. It would - it will - make an excellent text for those doing women's studies, as to those doing social movement studies, whether globally or more locally.	1

140630137X:slow_starter-_excellent_ending:p._b._jones	I was very excited to get my hands on this book.  I have been ordering this series from Amazon.co as they are released as I can get them several months ahead on their American counter parts.  I must say that I was disappointed with the beginning of the book.  First- Hem is not the character that I wanted to read about.  Second- the start is slow and the plot drags a little.  But- all is forgiven after 100 pages.  I warmed up to Hem.  I actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right.  I was done reading way before I wanted to be done.  The ending is nothing but action.  I put the book down entertained and wanting more.  What else can you ask for in a work of fictio	1

0882662597:good_on_the_seed,_but_not_on_the_bloom:"justluckyiguess"	I have been planting flowers from seed in my home for almost 5 years now.  Last year I had over 1400 seedlings on multi-level shelves under flourescent and natural light in my dining room. (Boy do I need a greenhouse!)  So this book was not a lot of new information to me.  A lot of what is listed can be found on the back of a seed packet, but it's not practical to sit on the floor of my favorite garden supply store and read every seed package for suggestions before I buy it.  (This is important, because I'm not interested in refrigerating my seeds 3 weeks before I plant them or doing other such preparations required for some seeds.) One major thing missing from this book was photography.  There were drawings, but I'm sorry to say that they were mostly a way of breaking up the monotony of the text rather than a reference tool.  On the good side, this book did an excellent job of providing the proper germination environment, and each plant had a quick reference in a shaded box that listed the type of plant (annual, perennial, etc), its hardiness zone, and its flowering season.  This allowed me to quickly eliminate the plants that were inappropriate for my zone.  The regular index wasn't very useful, but one wonderful addition was an index of the common &amp; latin names.  I refer to this when looking at some of my books that include the full color photography I was missing.  (Almost makes up for it....almost!) Of course, there is the standard hardiness zone map, but they also added a map each for the probable first and last frost dates.  (Nice!)  Also included was a directory of seed companies and their addresses.  All in all, this book does a good job of covering the seed part, but a poor job of covering the bloom part	1

0451217152:psychic_house_flip:judy_brown_eyes	Abby Cooper has become my favorite amateur PI. The premise of this series, a young woman private detective who has strong psychic abilities which she uses to solve cases, is original and fun to read. Abby is a psychic, but she also has the same trials and tribulations of a normal young woman, money, sibling and romance issues. In this latest book, Abby, her sister Cat, and Abby's handyman Dave, buy and plan to renovate a house, only the house turns out to be haunted! Poor Dave, Abbey's partner and handyman, is attacked by his own chainsaw as he begins the renovation! Determined to find out what's going on, Abby begins investigating the history of the home and discovers a missing treasure with ties to WWII Nazi Germany. In order to solve the mystery, Abby depends on her spirit guides to help her on the case. There is danger for Abby and her friends from an unknown stalker and the romance between Abby and Dutch becomes more intense as they each must sacrifice some of their independence to become a real couple. Ms. Laurie has a great series going here, and I look forward to reading more Abby mysteries.	1
0452265010:love_letters_is_simple,_yet_heartbreaking:	Love Letters has a very simple concept: Two people reading letters they wrote to each other on separate parts of the stage. They never look at each other. But within these letters is so much humor, love, and truth that the  play will carry you away with delight.  I read this play as I was browsing  through a bookstore. I just wanted to read the first couple of pages since  I'd heard so much about it. After page three, I didn't want to put it down.  Now I'm  buying it for a friend.  Don't think this play is a sappy  collection of gushy girl talk or even romance-novel fodder. If you have  ever been in love, you WILL recognize parts of yourself in this. It always  stays true to its well-drawn characters, which is what makes the end so  heartbreakingly wonderful	1

Larry Cuban explores this problem in great detail, offering an explanation as to why the billions of dollars spent across the nation on computers isn't improving academic performances.  He also offers solutions as to what the nation needs to do to remedy this situation.  A very thought provoking piece!  If only our politicians would read it	1
1883332370:dm_bull_run_review:	I think this is the best book that I have ever read. I thought that the Civil War was very, very boring but when our class started to read Bull Run I knew that I was wrong. The way that Paul Fleischman writes he would leave you wanting to read more. From the way Paul Fleischman described the characters to the words that Paul Flesichman use to set the tone of the characters he just seem to draw a cool picture of what is going on in your minds eye. Each character has a different story of the war and of life. I would suggest this book to anyone who is learning about the Civil War. It supplies you with a lot of information you might not get in  the history book and tells it in a way that makes you want to learn. This book was excellent from the first page I read. Even though this novel is very brilliant, some people might not like it. If they can not wait to know what happens to a favorite character, like one of my favorite characters Dietrick Herz. He had the funniest voice I ever heard. When Paul Fleischman leaves you hanging he really leaves you hanging. But the only way to find out the ending is to read the entire book and find out what happens for yourself. And trust me it will be worth your while this truly is a magnificent book. The best that I have ever read and if I liked it then for surely you will love it too, trust me. Before I read Bull Run I had only read books with one or two characters and this type of book was really, really new to me. I had to get use to it a little but since it wasn't very hard to read it only took a short time to adjust to the Bull Run story by Paul Fleischman. Some of the characters that I really liked was Toby Boyce because he had a good attitude on trying to learn how to use the fife. Another was Carlotta King because she had a very spunky voice in this story like how the Yankees would get rid the of the law so that the slaves could be free and be in control of there own religion and what I mean by that is they can practice there own religion. Another one of my favorite characters is Vergil Peavy. I think that he was my favorite character because of the way he sounds in the story. In the story he sounds like he's from Texas also the way how he talks about the war like they were the big war heroes. And my last favorite character is Shem Suggs because he was the lonly one who likes to talk about horses and to horses also what they are like who they should be with. Shem Suggs is the person who takes care of all the horses, that he watches pretty much like baby sitting the horses. But the reason I really really like him is because he minds his own business and doesn't talk to people about the war and the politics all he talks to are his friends which are the horces. That is the reason why I like Shem Suggs the best out of all the other characters the best because he is smart	1
0300059175:ideas_of_the_new_world:nick	This book was an amazing account of the Spanish in North America.  Many of  the themes that occur during this time period occur in almost every time  period and place.  Dealing with religious intolerence, slavery, econmoy,  unification, and the influence of all people on one another this book  captures everything.  Themes this book expresses about this time period are  even more evident in today's information age as more people from different  backgrounds and heritages come together on the internet.  This was a good  book to read, and made it easy to see the flaws and benefits of the past  showing what not to, and what to, repeat	1

So, in picking up this book I had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher.  No disappointment.  Even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others, all are at least wonderful, and several are both brilliant and touching.	1
0872205762:the_best_short_scholarly_account_of_pythagoreanism:leigh_mckinnon	Charles H. Kahn's account of the Pythagorean philosophical tradtion, although less than 200 pages long, is well worth reading as what it lacks in quantity it makes up for in quality. In a concise, but intelligent, summary, Kahn traces Pythagoreanism from its semi-legendary founder through to such early modern scientists as Copernicus and Kepler. As a young academic who specialises in the Pythagorean tradition I can recommend this work wholeheartedly to scholars, but as a Latinist I must say I was disapointed by Kahn's treatment (or lack of) of this strand of Western philosophy in late Roman and Medieval thought. But, this is still the best up to date history of Pythagoreanism available in the English language	1

030726291x:a_truly_wonderful_book:strixneb	I like this author's work so much that I actually bought the hard cover since I couldn't wait for the pb to be issued.  However, P. D. James' view of life as expressed by her characters can be very pessimistic at times (a contrast to her autobiography).  In this one, there is still the feeling that the characters are going through the motions of living, never really feeling any joy--or often even happiness.  However, when Adam and Emma come together at the end, there was a ray of hope.  Please, Ms. James give us a new book ASAP	1
1892613026:oh_the_weather_outside_is_frightful...:e._r._bird_"ramseelbird"	I once read an article in Horn Book Magazine (a review source of titles and articles on children's literature) that lamented the millions of poor translations of Hans Christian Andersen polluting the minds of our young people today.  The review mentioned that stories like, "The Snow Queen", which were originally written in a snappy vernacular, have been dumbed down and drained of all energy by their American translators.  With this idea fresh in my mind I found myself in possession of a very particular copy of "The Snow Queen" and I was able to test this theory myself.  Now due to the wacky nature of Amazon.com, the website has lumped together the reviews of every single version of this Anderson story.  You will see that some of the reviews refer to Nilesh Mistry's, some refer to the audio book, some to Eileen Kernaghan's, and some (God help us all) to Mary Engelbreit.  None of these, however, are the version that I am reviewing.  After careful consideration, I selected the edition retold by Amy Ehrlich and illustrated by Susan Jeffers.  The Ehrlich/Jeffers team has banded together to bring us every fairy tale from Thumbelina to Cinderella.  With this 1982 classic edition, they bring all the creepy and crawly elements of Andersen's riveting tale to a kind of tame middlebrow life.	1

0786249153:furst_captures_the_atmosphere:douglas_s._wood_"vicarious_life"	More than anything else Alan Furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of World War II espionage. I.A. Serebin inhabits the urbane world of Russian emigres in the Europe of 1940-1941, mainly in Paris, but also in Roumania. Serebin is recruited into what seems to be the British secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of Roumanian oil to the Nazi war machine. The whole operation reeks of amateurism - appropriate enough at that stage of the war - brainy, careful, daring, but amateur. With one exception, none of the players know completely what they are part of - which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line. Still Furst's prose forms the characters into full-dimensional beings from Bogart's Casablanca or Graham Greene's Human Factor.	1

0525949992:guess_who's_back?!?:ms_toni_"avid_reader"	My boy EJD is back, and so am I!  Keeping it real, I took an Eric Jerome Dickey hiatus.  For years he held a special spot on my shelf as my favorite author, hands down.  Then it happened...his books just weren't doing it for me anymore.  Call in change, call it growth, falling off, call it whatever, but I wasn't feeling it.  DRIVE ME CRAZY drove me crazy and I couldn't finish it.  Unheard of for me.  CHASING DESTINY came, but I let her run right past me.  However, the title of his new release piqued my interest, so I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did.	1
1590301005:especially_informative_for_connoisseurs_of_tibetan_art:midwest_book_review	The Handbook Of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols by Robert Beer (who has studied and practice Tibetan thanga painting for more than thirty years) is a straightforward reference guide to the meaningful symbolism of sacred Tibetan art. Black-and-white illustrations depict all the major Buddhist symbols and motifs, while the text offers depth and interpretation behind the meaning and usage of each. The Handbook Of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols is enthusiastically recommended for inclusion into Buddhist Studies and especially informative for connoisseurs of Tibetan art	1

0070342849:every_active_pilot_and_future_pilot_should_read_this_book.:	Tony Kern has managed to pull together the wisdom and experience of  &quot;the best&quot; pilots around. His use of case studies of real pilots  and real situations includes examples from the military, commercial, and  geneal aviation communities. In short, the book is useful for any pilot  whether they are working toward their private pilot license or are employed  as a senior airline captain. For many pilots, it will reinforce what they  already know and practice but for many, it will provide the opportunity to  become &quot;old&quot; pilots.  If you fly, read the book	1
0786714352:the_man_who_left_a_permanent_stain_on_political_wheeling_dealing:peter_lorenzi	This is an enlightening, meticulous story of William "Boss" Tweed and, as past of the context, his three key cronies in the ring: Peter Sweeny, Richard Connolly and Oakley Hall. It is a story about how the New York Times elevated itself by getting the goods on corruption and bravely exposing it on the front page. Oh how the mighty have fallen!	1
0785731261:the_best:gene_venable	This is the best review of the JFK assassination that I have seen. There is still a large "assassination industry," which can afford to find documents that you haven't read and charge you with ignorance if you haven't read them, and find 15 more if you read them. This gives a common-sense overview that seems quite reasonable. I trust it. I am always willing to consider other opinions, but the balance of evidence has always indicated that Oswald acted alone.	1

Not only is the setting and atmosphere cozy, but the clues, story line, and pacing are perfect!  This author definitely has talent!!!  The clues are perfectly and cleverly crafted and lead to the mystery solving.  And the characters - you feel like you know them!!!  I love this small town and all the characters.  Not just the main characters, but the other characters have purpose and meaning in this book.	1

"Guards!  Guards!" is the eighth book in the Discworld series, in which Captain Sam Vimes of Ankh-Morpork's Night Watch gives up drinking and gets married (just the opposite of most folks).  I don't read the Discworld novels in order any more, just pick up a favorite and start in.	1

Great book complete with historical accuracy & lively illustrations.  Approximately 3rd grade reading level, interesting to even older elementary students.  Don't rely on it for a primary source, but include it in a study of Greece.  Nice book	1
B0007HX2CY:solid!:whoami?	This book ranks along side Will Durant's "Story of Philosophy" as the best book on Western Philosophy. The key difference is that whereas Durant deals only with some selected individuals, Russell gives a comprehensive history.

1571781234:thank_you_for_this_book!!!:ruth_in_baltimore,_md	This book is lovely, the perfect "medicine" for our hectic lives in this constantly-changing world.  It has a lot of information packed in, yet is presented in a clear, straightforward manner.  As I read the book, many things about my life and the way I react to change fell into place for me, and this book gave me not only new insights about myself, but also practical, positive ideas for better ways I can deal with change in my own life	1
3791330683:niki_for_kids:lcsw	With beautiful photos of the range of Niki's work, this children's book enables both kids and adults to get an overview of Niki's work, especially her sculptures.

007048242X:i'm_excited_about_the_2nd_edition:matthew_m._yau_"voracious_reader"	It is almost like dream comes true when I saw the revised, new second edition out at the bookstore.  The imrpoved edition not only has amended the errors or typo in its predecessor, but has graciously added new/updated materials in synthesis.  You may see it as an equivalent to Jerry March's Advanced Organic Chemistry but a whole different approach.  The sections on oxidations, reductions, and organoboranes are excellent.  Since organic synthesis is a broad and infinitely growing field, not a single book covers all the principles and gadgets of organic chemistry.  Use it as an encyclopedia or along with popular title like Nicholaou's Classics in Total Synthesis in order to enjoy the wonders of organic chemistry	1
0465041760:absorbing_even_for_the_lay_reader:sophia_dembling	I read this book even before it was assigned to my undergrad psychology class -- and then I read it again, and enjoyed it both times. De Wall does protest too much -- he's clearly answering his critics throughout -- but I found his curmudgeonly outbursts amusing. More importantly, De Wall's arguments for the existence of culture in animals are persuasive (not that I needed much persuading), and his use of anecdotes keep the book entertaining. I'm looking at my pet pooches in a whole new way these days	1

0141001992:chilling:erin_brooks_"erin_brooks"	Leah Stewart is a talented writer. I read this book after finishing her most recent novel, The Myth of You and Me (which I highly recommend). This story is dark and chilling. Olivia is a young reporter covering crimes in Memphis on a hot summer. When the body of girl is found, the case becomes eerily personal for Olivia and the lines between professional duty and personal struggles become blurred as she gets deeper into the murdered girl's story and life. The characters in this novel are deep and well developed, and the sultry atmosphere of a hot summer in Memphis is well rendered. I highly recommend this book	1

25296	Bought these for my Nikon D200 about 3 months ago. Never having used Tiffen before I took a chance on a recommendation. Vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse I've seen. Build quality of all the filters is really not very good. Going to go back to Hoya's which are much better	0
55680	The bag is suppose to hold two cameras,I have a rebel and two lens and cant fit them in with lens filters and extra batteries. I recomend you buy a bigger bag it does not meet the billing here. might be good for a couple of point and shoot cameras but not SL	0
81625	When I received the camera I thought of giving it a 5 star because the good looking and nice picture.	0
84886	I have been using this cord for about a year, and I had problems with its durability.  It actually worked fine for a for the first 5 months, but then it started to fall apart.  When mounted on the hotshoe of my flash bracket, the thin plastic shoe (where the flash is attached to) developed a crack and eventually broke off, making it useless to mount the flash.  I had to buy a replacement part from Canon (who charged me $16 for this small plastic piece).  I flipped the flash carefully from then on, but then it still cracked!!  I wrote to Canon and asked them to reinforce the bottom maybe made of metal instead of thin plastic. So far, there is no response.  A few months later, the cord, for some unknown reason, makes my 550ex flash switch from the ETTL to TTL mode, and making the flash fire at full power, overexposing  the entire image.  I checked the flash by putting it directly on the camera's hotshoe, and the flash worked fine, switching back to the ETTL mode.  For a piece of equipment from Canon, it's hard to imagine it giving so many problems. It's like they only paid tons more attention to their cameras than their accessories.  As there are no other OEM manufacturers of this cord, I am forced to get another one and hope for the best.	0
122510	I purchased this bag because I did not wnat to spend a ton of money on a case to protect my Canon Rebel EOS digital camera. I only have 2 lenses, but the bag is capable of holding the camera and 4 lenses as well as pockets for cables, batteries, etc. I think this is a great unit, for the beginner (like me) or the pro.	0
130889	I was expecting much more from this flash, I already started looking for the better one. If I knew this was a closeout item I'd never buy it. It died on me with no indication, sent to canon fixed and returned with a big scratch on it. Now it does work but sometings wrong with recycle time even with brand new duracell batteries...	0
134444	I do video work and was attracted to the sale price and extra height of this particular tripod.  Come to find out, this model does not have a fluid head, meaning, if you do any panning with a camcorder, it won't be as smooth as you'd probably like it to be.  Also, at the end of a pan the head tends to "unwind," causing your panned image to back up a little ways.  Thus, I think it's rather misleading to label this as a "Photo / Video" tripod.	0
159814	This item is either not coated or has a single coating and thus any time sun hits the filter, it produces flare in the picture.  Furthermore, after doing more research it turns out that these uncoated or single coated filters can cause up to 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like Hoya S-HMC or B+W MRC filters.  As for polarizer effect itself, I think it's amazing and you owe it to yourself to at least try it on a nice sunny day. (the sky and foliage will look completely different and alive	0

179762	I got this for my S70. First off, in order to use it, you have to set the S70 to "radio control" (about 9 button pushes). Then you had better stay no further away than six feet or so (and only in *front* of the camera-the remote doesn't work from the rear!). Oh, and if you want to adjust your framing, forget it-the zoom is immobilized.	0
195576	I purchased this set, and upon arrival, I found the circular polarizer to be defective.  Amazon quickly replaced the set, and this polarizer did not work either!  I returned the set, as I am not going to waste any more time trying to get a polarizer that works.  I'll pay more, and get a quality product from a different maker.  I will say that Amazon is second to nobody for customer service.  I appreciate that, and will continue to be an Amazon customer.  However, I can't say the same for Tiffen.	0
206501	Yes, I have to agree with the previous review.  It doesn't seem to make any difference in reducing lens flare from light sources.  It doesn't seem to extend far enough to actually do anything.  If it was less expensive I wouldn't mind as much, and just chalk it up to extra protection.  But that seems to be all it's good for	0
224778	Just for the record, my lens has frozen as many others have complained on this and earlier Casio models. Presently in Iraq, I do want to have a camera with me, but am not inclined to send it back in view of the reports of poor customer service. Sad. It looked to be a great camera	0
240129	I received this filter and it had been used, seals were open and case that holds filters cracked, piece of plastic floating loose inside, smug marks on it. I was shocked, I order from amazon all the time and never had anything show up like this.	0
247765	I have known Canon to be a very high quality company. However, I was deeply shocked and disappointed to find that this camera fails to meet the expectations I had about this camera. A few years ago I bought the Fujiffilm 3800. I loved this camera but after a few ski trips I found it rather bulky. I then bought the Canon S500 becaus of its small size and after many good reviews about the S400. For most of the pictures I take on a ski trip this camera is fine. However, if you are taking pictures other than outdoors in the daytime, this camera is worse than a disposable camera. First, there is no red-eye reduction. It simply does not work when I set it to take flash with red-eye reduction. Second, pictures taken at dusk or dawn come out blurry. I would speculate that the shutter speed is way too slow and you would need a tripod. Third, night picture?....Forget about it. I tried to get a beatiful picture of the Chicago skyline but the picture was underexposed. So, I tried the manual mode and played with the exposure settings and I could not get a setting that would produce non-blurry pictures. Looks like I'll be back in the market for a Fujifilm. After all the reviews I've read, I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop (E18, LCD, etc.). Not to mention the terrible service that I have been reading about	0
251913	For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good	0
253895	These are my experiences with the extender mounted to my EOS 10D. I'm currently debating whether or not to buy it for my new 30D, but it looks like I don't want to risk wasting my money. Let me explain:	0

290872	I have owned this camera for about a year and I have never really enjoyed it.  For a point and shoot it is bad, it takes pictures way too slowly and I often miss out on a good shot.  It is also not as user friendly as I would have hoped it to be with so many scene settings.  While I enjoy some of them, most of the time my pictures turn out grainy (in low light), whitewashed (with flash) or blurry (of even slowly moving objects).  I have tried changing the exposure time and shutter speed to counter some of these things, but I rarely get a good picture when I need it.  I never had these problems with my ELPH s200.  This camera is also a lot more bulkier as well, and the cover over the lens has started to stick so that it does not fully open when turned on. If given the option I would not buy this camera again	0
297070	The camera case only works if you wear a belt-- there is no clip on. The case itself holds only the camera, not even space for a spare battery or memory card. (I've heard the case will darken your camera, but I didn't end up using the case). The neck strap is not useful, it's too long. At '34 inches, if you're not careful you could swing your camera into something and break it. (The Canon Camera rocks, however.	0
308473	Polarizing filters are used to eliminate glare on non-metallic surfaces like glass or water. They can also be used to increase the contrast and color saturation of your image. I use my polarizer not only to eliminate glare, but also to make skies a nice shade of blue or to get some "pop" out of clouds.	0
345533	The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s.	0
350833	I bought this lens for my Canon 30D after reading every professional review I could find.  I knew going in that this lens wasn't perfect but, was supposed to be better than the 18-55 kit lens.  I liked the range that it provided and the image stabilization.  I shot pictures with this lens and was extremely dissapointed.  The pictures were not sharp at all and the colors were dull.  I thought it might have been my new camera at first because I couldn't imagine the quality would be this bad.  I ruled this out after I used my Canon 28-105 lens I had for my Canon film SLR and the results were much better.  For the digital focal length though, my old lens wouldn't suffice because of the 1.6x focal factor.	0

396493	Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months	0
419883	I have just bought the Sony Cybershot w100 camera little over a month ago and I have only taken 30-40 pictures, I loved it and then it just stopped working, so I recharged the baterry, no luck still the camera wouldn't turn off or on. So Thankfully I had bought a 2nd backup battery charged it and tried the camera again. No it doesn't work it only makes a slight ding sound and shuts off. Basically worthless. It seems like it might have short circuited. But I was so excitted to buy this camera I read all instructions before use, I haven't let anyone else use it and it hasn't been out of my sight, never been dropped, never in extreme hot or cold, always well protected. SO I am going to try to return it or exchange it. I am hoping to get good service or I will be really upset for spending so much money and research just to take 30-40 pictures. Hopefully I can let you know if they stand by their products. Before now I have always been happy with what I have bought from Amazo	0
422772	This bag is very small. My Canon 20D fits nicely with a small lens, but you cannot fit more than one lens with the camera body. We kept the bag for informal use when we only need the body and one lens to avoid always having to carry a bulky bag	0

This is 2/3 the cost of a new camera and does not make sense financially.	0

597145	This camera will probably go down in Nikon's history as one of its most over-priced  and disappointing cameras. I bought mine through Amazon from Calumet in January 2003. From the start, the colors never looked right, especially the ghastly magenta-toned skin tones.  I also bought the SB800s (3 of them), thinking the CLS would be a great addition. But the system uses IR and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments.	0
B0002ZONRE:garbage:d.c._dad	This camera is garbage. It was a disappointment for my son and a waste of my money. It was hard to figure out, it took lousy pictures, it burned through batteries. Avoid this camera. I just wish I could give it zero stars	0

B0007ZGXQI:white_screen:valerie	Not too long after I purchased this camera the screen turned white when I turned it on. I would turn it off and on and nothing would help. Finally I would take the batteries out and put them back in. This seemed to fix the problem a few times. After that I thought it was just operator error. But it wasn't. The camera finally gave out and the white screen never went away. So after being annoyed I left the camera alone for awhile. An event came up about a month later. I got my camera and tried to turn it on. Nothing happened. So I changed the batteries. Still nothing happened. I'm not sure what happened. I do believe I purchased a LEMON camera. I'm hoping to resolve these issues with Samsung. It was one of the cheapest cameras on the market at the time. So I guess you get what you pay for!	0

I even changed out the batteries and it's still completely dead.  This is the first digital camera I've had and I bought it because I'm going to Europe (two days after it died).

B000H7MHFC:poor_interlacing,_worst_low_light_camera:l._schrader	This Canon camera has poor quality interlacing artifacts all though out, on a 1080p monitor.  I have used other HDV format cameras, and they were much better. The low light level recording was filled with fairly large digital grain.  If you use a 1080i tube then it will probably look ok in high light, but still plauged in low light	0

It never worked, ever, and shipping it back to exchange would cost more than a new unit!  At least I have the 4 batteries it came with, so it isn't a total loss.  Don't make the same mistake.

I replaced it with the S5100, it has a slightly better feature set over the S5000 (in particular shutter speed choices) while on a trip to Niagara Falls, I was unfortunate to give my camera a slight jolt (and I mean slight) after that it wouldn't power up.

B000BP8AMY:don't_bother_buying_this:j._miller_"teton_habiton"	Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off	0

CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it.

B0002AHQT6:watch_the_part_number:camera_user	I have an R717 camera.  I bought the dock too.  Each one comes with a battery and the batteries look identical.  HP labels both as an R07 battery but the L1812A has squared edges running logitudinally and this feature makes it very difficult to remove from the camera.  The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera. I bought a "clone" battery (not HP) and its edges are rounded too.  Maybe HP could explain the difference.  Just thought you would like to know	0
B00097BYFY:disappointed:j._pennetto	This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures.  I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality	0

I had this problem before with low batteries but I changed them and it still didn't work. It would let me review pictures but not take them and now it wont turn on at all and the lens is stuck out. So many other people have had this exact problem after just one year of use. SO SAD CAMERA DEA	0

B000BPCWEQ:no_support_for_bad_lcd_screen:laurel_j._kaeferlein_"3_kids'_mommy"	I'm sure that if the camera worked properly, it would have been fantastic; however, I received a camera on my birthday this year, only to have difficulty with the focussing mechanism.  I took 4 blurry shots of my son's birthday party, and the next time I turned the camera on, the LCD screen was broken.  We purchased the extended warranty from Best Buy, so when I brought the camera (10 days old, mind you) in for repair, they insisted that I'd dropped it and broken it (which I hadn't), even though there were no signs of external damage...no scratches, dents or anything.  After sending it in, Best Buy informed me that it would cost us $180 to fix, and that they wouldn't fix the focussing mechanism until I'd paid for the LCD screen to be fixed.  Disgusted, I retrieved my camera from customer service unfixed.  I contacted Sony, who appologized and told me to send in my camera for free repair.  I ended up receiving a call from their repair center, informing me that it would cost me $180 to repair and that LCD screens are not covered, whether I received it broken or not.  I tried a third time for repair, only to be told that I would have to pay.  My mother tried to use her Buyer's Protection Plan from her Visa (it was a birthday gift from her to me), only to have her money refunded, then re-charged months later when Best Buy's legal department wouldn't pay her Visa bill.	0

B00007FHBT:incompatible_with_panasonic_lumix_fz1:tahir_j._naim	The manufacturer apparently states this case is compatible with the Panasonic FZ1 (and by extension the FZ3 which has an identical body).  I bought it and can report that it is not compatible with the FZ1.  With just the lens cap on you have to jam it into the bag sideways and then wrestle with the camera to get it back out.  If you prefer to use the camera with the lens hood adapter on the camera can't fit in the bag at all.  There's also no padding to speak of with this case.  By comparison my Lowe case for my Canon EOS Elan provides a secure, padded repository and you can put the camera in lens down with the strap on top so the camera can easily be withdrawn again.	0

I couldn't fine another R607 (which I really liked), so I purchased the HP M407. I thought it would be the next best thing to my misplaced camera...NOT!! I don't like anything about this camera...It's terrible!  You can take about 4 pictures with regular batteries, about 10 with rechargeable ones (even with screen off). It says "auto focus", but I don't think it has any focus at all....not far away, not close up, nothing! It takes a really looooooooong time to actually Take the picture after you press the button.

B000M3ILF6:amazon_service_below_1_star:big_ginger_"big_ginger"	I ordered the Sony DCR-DVD108 on April 9.  I still haven't received the camera.  What I have received are 2 e-mails stating that the product is late without any sort explanation why.  As far as I'm concerned it is too late!  The first stated that the shipment would leave on April 16.  When I purchase the camera, I did so because the add stated that if I wanted the camera by April 12, I needed to order it in the next 11 hours and 23 minutes.  This I did.  The next e-mail that arrived just this morning and I've been informed that it will arrive between April 26 and May 3.   I have already missed recording one of my seven year old daughter's gymnastics competitions and now if stick with their delivery dates, I'll be missing 2 more.  Well, I'm not missing 2 more and Amazon is getting the camera back. The best part of this is that I don't even have the option of canceling the order because Amazon is and I quote, "... preparing these items for shipment and this portion of your order cannot be canceled or changed."  If you can't get the order out on time, you should respect your customer enough to offer cancellation of the shipment or better yet, try some real customer service and have the product shipped from a competitor at your cost.  I can tell you with certainty that sort of customer service would bring your customers for life.	0

The light on the charger didn't flash or the camera didn't even go in after dying.  The second time I used it, I just got back from vacation and put it on the charger.  I was able to turn it on to look at the pictures.  As I was looking at the pictures, it just shut off.  I was unable to find a way to turn it back on or even shut the nose.

B0001G6UCA:i_regret_i_bought_this.:kau_-__the_taste_of_classic	For quite sometime lured by media publicity I thought Sony a good brand. But this was not at all true for digital cameras. I bought this P73 for myself and an HP 4 MP camera for my cousin much cheaper than Sony. Both 3x Optical zoom. The HP one was far better in image quality. Main problem is that photo quality is not so good. It lacks sharpness and in most of the natural occassions becomes a bit hazy. This fact becomes annoying because your friend who has a Cannon or an HP camera will take sharper pictures better than you in any light conditions. Also, in the same price you might look for something higher than 3x optical zoom, say 5x or so in other brands. Also during video, every option of adjusting to light conditions etc will be shut off, another irritating fact.	0

The camera showed an "E18" error in the middle of a special event.  We researched the error online and found that almost anything can cause this error, from turning the camera off while it has a low battery to having something in front of the lens while turning it on.  We're not sure how ours developed the E18 (never dropped or damaged.) Our camera has been rendered useless and Canon's only response it to have us mail it in for $100 repair	0
B0002OD3JY:another_dissatisfied_customer:mark_duncan	Add another E18 error code complaint to the list!  I purchased the camera about a year ago, and have had the E18 error for about the last 2 months.  The camera will intermitently freeze up and not work at all, just beep at you and give you an error code E18.  I've tried all the recommended fixes from the compressed air to the alignment twist.  Nothing seems to keep it functioning for more than a few shots.  Canon wants nothing to do with the fix, and estimates repairs between $150 and $200.  Save the headaches, and buy another camera from a different manufacturer!	0

The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0

The P3 was the fourth point and shoot Nikon camera my family has owned.  One of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it.  On the P3 the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on.  I accidently dropped it from about 30" off the ground when it was only a few days old.  It landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens.  The outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus. I sent it back to Nikon and as I expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty.  They charged $162.50 to fix it.  MasterCard has a program called "Purchase Assurance" that will hopefully cover the repair cost!	0

B000063W8X:get_a_convertor_box_instead:m4a	Instead of this pick up a Plextor convertor box.  It takes the output of the camcorder (composite/RCA or S-Video) and compresses that to mpeg-2 (DVD) or mpeg-4 (or DivX) and includes software which easily burns that to DVD or CD (mpeg-1 or mini DVD).  Look for Plextor's M402U box.  Unless you really want to deal with 3.125 MB of data per second (25 Mbps), or about 180 MB per minute, or about 11 GB per hour through the firewire link, get the M402U.  Your options will be greatly expanded, and you won't tell the difference by looking	0

B0007KQWGE:kodak_printer_dock_=_lemon:big_john_stud_"bjs62"	Terrible product.  Printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly.  I've had a replacement sent and the same thing happens.  Even though I have printed less than 50 photos with this replacement, which I have had less than a year, Kodak support says it cannot be fixed by me and I need to have it serviced by them for 80 bucks.  A new one sells for $99 and the price is dropping fast.  I told Kodak support I would not send it back to them, spending 80 dollars would be like flushing money down the toilet or taking a stick in the eye. I further notified Kodak that I would instead send it to the place it belongs - a land fill.	0
B000GHULTM:piece_of_garbage..._don't_buy_it:amazon_buyer_"disapointed_with_lumix_camera"	The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.	0
B0007OV45Y:a_real_problem:early_adapter	After doing a bunch of research, I bought two of these for my teenage kids since they were said not to have the defective Sony CCD that late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem to have had.  The first zamera lasted six months before the lcd display began to worsening exhibit dark striations.  After a few days of that, the camera dies completely.  The second camera made it another two months before falling prey to the same disease.  One camera . . . a fluke maybe.  But two?  That suggests a real problem so beware.	0

B0007QN89M:poor_auto_focus:gary_s._chandler	I thought I was upgrading from analog to digital but after seeing the videos I shot indoors I liked the analog better. Very poor and grainy.  Also the focus is terrible! While filming 3 people in a row moving from one to the other the focus would blur then refocus.  I filmed my daughter's ballet recital and could not believe how the auto focus kept bluring then focusing.  Very disappointed with this purchase.  I guess it's true what they say. "You get what you pay for"  It seems under $600.00 doesn't get you much	0

Do not buy these.	0
B00061S2QW:automatic_lens_cover_problems_galore!:peter_l._petraitis	My ownership of this camera was brief.  First, you must know I love Nikon.  I have 2 other Nikons--an old Cooplix 2200 and a Coolpix 5700.  They have wonderful lenses and give great pix.  I thought my experience with this model would be similar.  NOT!~  From picture numero uno, the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate.  I got pictures, yes, but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens.  What a dissappointment!  I traded it in for a Canon A520 and am happy with that camera.  I suppose it is just what it is.  If I'd saved and spent a lot more money on a D50 or Rebel, who knows?  Anyway,  that is my sad tale with the Nikon 4800	0
B0007UQNY0:where's_the_user_manual?:gilbert_aldous_"confused_consumer"	I agree with the two previous reviewers.  There needs to be a user manual and there isn't one.  The fine adjustment will adjust the vertical angle maybe 15 degrees.  This isn't very helpful for star gazing.  The maximum height of the tripod is only 45 inches.  This is an uncomfortable height for looking through binoculars while standing. Celestron should have a users guide showing how their tripod and binoculars are supposed to work together	0

I've always owned Nikon products personally, but the features for the price of the S70 swayed me away from my usual Nikon brand loyalty.  In the 12 months I've had the S70, it's been sent to the factory twice for repairs--the second time was just 6 days before the warranty expired.  The first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track.  Eight months later, the flash quit working in all modes AND the door was failing AGAIN!	0

B0000965T0:doesn't_hold_a_charge:t._bentley_"cm_mom"	Not worth the money spent on it.  After reviewing info on my new digital camera I followed suggestions to get the rechargeable batteries kit to save money on AA batteries.  I did not need the camera case that came with this kit, and it really had too many pockets for my liking.  The batteries did not hold a charge.  I only got a few pictures taken before they went dead.  If the spare set sat in the camera for a few days they too were dead.  At least I got a full set of pictures taken on the duracell ones.  I would much rather buy batteries and have them on hand then always be running back to the charger after a few shots.  I have had no experience with rechargables before so I do not know if this is common.  But I returned this item as a defect because for this amount of money you should get more then six pictures per charge	0

My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks.	0

B000BMVITE:digital_photo_frame_junk:william_t._george	I bought this product from a nearby retailer. The packaging is deceptive. The Photoframe must be plugged into an external power source or you must buy a uniquely designed battery from the manufacturer. The battery is $35.00 with shipping, and it is poorly designed so that when installed the battery case rubs the connector wiring. This frame has no on-board memory, so to use it you must have one of the two types of memory it accepts. This is an additional expense. After purchasing the Photoframe I discovered the plastic frame was chipped and the device did not perform as the instructions said it should. I took it back to the store and opened eight boxes before I found one which had an unbroken frame. I took that Photoframe home and discovered the device would not work as the instructions described. I then went to another of the retailers' locations to exchange the device (the original location had shipped their entire inventory back to the manufacturer). With the retailer's very helpful clerks I tested three more PhotoCo Photoframe devices, none of them worked as described (they would not scroll through and album of photos). I returned the item to the retailer and received a full refund for the device, then by email I requested a refund for the price of the battery. Photoco replied that if I sent them the battery they would refund its price. I mailed the battery on May 6,and then inquired about my refund on May 14. PhotoCo replied that the only employee who could process the refund was out sick. On 3/17 I sent an email demanding immediate processing of my refund. PhotoCo said that my credit had been processed but that I might not see the credit for 7 to 10 days. I still have not received my credit for the battery. If you want to avoid a headach, avoid doing business with this company. Read the other reviews before considering this product	0

B000184C2S:could_be_much_better:a._endo	I've had this battery for half a year and I agree with a fellow reviewer's assessment that the battery does not hold much power.

Now i am going to buy a new charger/battery altogether because I don't want to buy another Delkin battery	0
B000EN81ZE:stop_-_do_not_buy_this_product:a._stepanoff_"proud_psu_engineer"	I am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 Mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! Read on!	0
B000HAOVEE:am_i_doing_something_wrong?:frazipe_"frazipe"	I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck	0
B000066HUG:poor_image_quality_and_design:wendy_c.	I purchased this camera and took it to the beach.  The photos were so bad, I threw them away.  The images were all washed-out and blurry.  Also, the film advancing mechanism is very tricky, so several of the pictures I took overlapped each other.  I've used other disposable cameras before that wouldn't let you take a picture until the film had been fully advanced to the next frame.  With this camera, I advanced the film until the mechanism stopped, and the camera allowed me to take another picture.  Unfortunately, the film hadn't advanced fully and the next picture partially overlapped the previous picture that I had taken.  What a waste of money this camera was!	0
B000E1HW6A:could_have_been_perfect:mds_"mdotddot"	In theory, this camera is perfect. Fits into your pocket. Video quality is definately good considering it records in the compressed format of MPEG-4. Pictures are good if you know how to finesse it. Perfect all around anytime camrea, right?	0
B000K3L7KO:light_sensitive_sensor_but_very_noisy_pictures:lalelisi	I bought this camera in the beginning of January. I was looking for a compact camera (not necessarily pocket size, though) that was capable of taking great pictures and that was also capable of taking movies in a decent quality. Based on test reports at DPreview and other customer reports I decided for the Fuji F31fd. I was intrigued by the new sensor that Fuji is using and that seems to be very light sensitive, which is true. After receiving the camera I took a lot of test pictures under various conditions, with and without flash, bright light, low light, different ISO settings, different exposure times, etc. I compared the pictures with my 4-year old SONY DSC-V1 and the results were amazing. The picture quality of the Fuji was very poor. Colors were 'smeared' but the main problem was noise. Even under bright light conditions and ISO 100 settings the white had considerable noise, same with other colors (RGB noise). I didn't check grey/black noise (as they do in the test reports) but the noise in white and colors was just too annoying. What a disappointment. The lens seemed to be pretty poor as well, at least there was no comparison to the SONY DSC-V1 with a Carl Zeiss lens. After one week we returned the camera and I bought the SONY H5. This is really a great camera, I must admit. The picture quality is even better than with the V1 and I thought that the V1 was already pretty good. I can only recommend SONY's H5, even though it has a different form factor and may therefore not really compare to the much smaller F31fd. What I liked about the F31fd was its size, its responsiveness and the monitor and menu. However, if the picture quality is so poor it also doesn't really help	0
B000E0E6YC:do_not_buy_-_black_screen_gets_you_in_the_end:nicholas_shaw_"nick"	In my opinion this is not a marketable product. The cameras features are irrelevant if it does not work. There is clearly a design fault and the product should be withdrawn from sale until there is a fix. When it did work it was a convenient pocketable unit. As for HD - possibly at high noon in the Sahara, but in anything but perfect light the results are dissappointing.	0

B00006SNZN:perma-focus_is_almost_perma_blur...:s._taggart	I agree with reviewer Steve - anything less than a few hundred feet and these binocs are worthless.  The paper works says the "may" focus down to 35'.  Maybe some will but not certainly not my pair.  I am returning them since they are not good for simple viewing around the yard.  And no, the rubber eye caps ABSOLUTELY will not stay back making these binocs almost unusable by people with glasses (like me).	0
B000HBIKIG:serious_design_flaw:c._delaune	There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw.	0
B000DZKTHQ:only_good_for_outdoor_recording:p._kumar	This camcorder is only good for outdoor recording. In indoor recording or recording in little bit low light, picture quality is very bad.

Zoom works well	0
B000GPLA26:helpless:s._lerner	In the past, I have considered Amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites. To be perfectly honest, I am no longer sure. Two months ago, I bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on Amazon. This camera set was called the 1 GB Stylus 720 SW kit. Ironically, the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 GB cards! My first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories. Two weeks after receiving the kit, I emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake. After waiting a few weeks for a response, I decided to send them a second email. Again, no response. By this point, I felt helpless and turned to Amazon for aid. Surprisingly, Amazon was not much better than 47th st photo. Minutes after sending the email to Amazon, I received an automatic email informing me that Amazon had received my email. That was the last I heard from Amazon. More than two months have passed and I have not heard from either company	0

I ordered this for my daughter - it arrived defective; the primary mirror had slipped from its bracket, making collimation impossible. In Celestron's defense, it likely happened in transit. Amazon's return policy is not a hassle, and I'm upgrading her to another telescope. I'm sure that had this particular scope not arrived in a defective condition it would have made a great scope. Only criticism is the plugs on the back to cover the collimation screws pop out a bit too easily	0

B000FTHLNU:great_case_unless_you_want_to_attach_it_to_something:steve_azer_"photopassport.com"	Overall this is a well-designed case which is custom fit for your Panasonic LX1 or LX2 camera, but it has a few major flaws.  First, there is no simple way to attach it to your belt.  There is a belt loop on the back but it is so small and tight that it won't fit any belt more than 1/2" wide.  Also, there are two zippers on this case, one on each side, which could potentially scratch your camera coming in or out of the pocket.  Finally, the velcro tab that  closes the case is not particularly strong and can occassionally pop loose on its own.  This might be a good case if you are going to keep it in your backpack or suitcase, but not for carrying around for everyday use.	0

Every time that she went to use it the batteries were dead. We finally figured out that a new set would go dead in two days without ever turning it on! After several e mails they told me to call service. I got someone in India that could not understand me and I had a really hard time figuring out what he was saying. They made it very dificult to get it sent in. I sent it in today, but I do not expect much from the example that their service has done so far. I hope it comes back at least.	0
B0000AJB80:novice_challenges:s._chalfant	I am a novice photographer, so take this with a grain of salt...  I just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components.

We disconnected every electronic appliance in the house (cordless phone, microwave, even turned off our cell phones) and still the interference was there.  The video reception is awful, supposed to be up to 300 feet, we are only roughly 20 feet away and still the picture is terrible.

B000M4MT58:caveat_emptor;_noisy_recording_and_playback_unacceptable:dr._david_r._evans_"dr._dave"	I have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as 1) a replacement for my JVC GR-D70U, which died, and 2) to go online with a video blog.  After much study and evaluation, I chose the Canon ZR800 based on a salesman's recommendation, frustration as to the number of choices which are available, and the presence of an external microphone jack (which was one of my "must-have" options).  After returning home, I read the review by Miamian "New Reviewer", and felt trepidation.  After charging the battery, I tried the camera.  Lo and behold, Miamian is right.  There is an obvious noise when recording, which was not present in my JVC.  Hoping against hope, I played the tape back, and, just as I feared, the tape had a pronounced hiss.  This is not just tape hiss, but a much more pronounced noise, which transfers to the TV when watching.  It rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable. I took the camcorder back, and, like Miamian, ordered the Sony DCH-HC38.  (I know, it doesn't have an external microphone jack, but after all this confusion, I give up!! Why don't they make more cameras with them??)	0
B000DZFP98:no_docking_station_even_at_this_price???:m_fong	This is another example of how Sony is alienating its customer base. Not only will it not work with standard SD memory like everyone else, it does not include a docking station.  You have to shell out more money for that option.  I dont think so	0
B0002KH3QM:too_expensive_for_a_upgrade:john_ml.	I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200.	0
B000B8Y08E:not_good:andrew_marcantonio_"aj1marcan"	It looks cool and it's easy to carry, but that is about it.  Camera is slow and pictures are often blurry.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one.  Get one of the new ones with VR so you don't have that issue.	0

B000EOUL74:hp_q6227a_signature_soft-style_camera_case_(pink):linda_l._sutton	I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.	0
B000EHIQ00:don't_waste_your_time:ashraf_azmi_"fulltimethinker"	I returned this camera after trying very hard to like.  Picture quality (movie or still) is totally unacceptable.  I did not even get one good still picture.  Forget about indoors video or still.  The falsh and video light are useless.  The overall quality of the camera is low.	0
B000MFG44Y:cheap_plastic_cheap:christopher_j._coursey_"cj"	Straight out of the box disappointment with the extremely poor quality.  Plug into wall and does not work.  After trying numerous different outlets/wiggles of the cord, it finally powered on.  After putting in a card, the pics were ok, passable.  The mp3 popped and moaned and popped some more, and I was only playing very quiet jazz.  This is not worth the money even though it is cheap.  Pay a little more and get one that is of better quality	0
B00073ILEC:it's_not_great,_but_it_is_okay.:t._hernandez	If you are looking to take high quality pictures, then look elsewhere. It is nice for taking quick snapshots with the family or what-have-you, but not much else. (Or for a beginner in photography or a child.) You have to hold very still if you don't want your pictures to come out blurry. Also, the flash makes images far too bright and if you don't use the flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark.	0
B000AYJDD6:disappointment:not_convinced	After being an amature photographer via print film, I decided to try a digital camera - though I've been leary about printing quality.  I knew I couldn't afford a digital SLR, so I opted for a "snap shot" camera that I thought would have enough features to satisfy me.  However, after having and using this camera for a year now, I am so disappointed in the performace- the flash is just way too much, its a washout.  After being used to print and picture quality in my film SLR (Cannon, I might add), I was so severely annoyed with the quality of the pictures with this camera, I wish I would have just saved my money for a digital SLR.	0
B0002ISEIK:never_buy_this_camera:t._goffin	This camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  After purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  The computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  It not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  The instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  Even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  Unfortunately, I have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to	0
B00012FVYM:no_at_all_good:n._d._samant_"prasad"	I bought this bag looking at the display on amazon. But compare to price I paid this bag is not atall good. Size is small, extra pockets are useless, where you cant keep much. Camera pocket is also not convenient.	0

B00008ZGSP:bad_in_almost_every_way:scipio	I ordered this mic after having to return the ECMHS1 (because it was, in reality, totally non-directional).  Well, this one actually IS directional, but it is such a pain to use I wish I never bought it.	0
B0002XRWSI:blurry_pictures:s._boyle	Bought this camera to have better print pictures than what I get with the digital. I've tried using it in every mode AUTO, close-up, etc. but the autofocus never works so most of the pictures come out blurry!	0
B000NK8L6W:okay_for_general_use:azmonsoon	I bought this camera after reading the reviews and wanted to get a camera that uses a different media type other than the SmartMedia (which only lasts for about a month). I would have to say that I am extremely disappointed, particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges. Even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the PowerShot SD1000, my old Olympus Camedia C-2020 takes much better photos.	0

Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up "bricking" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon	0

B000246T5E:i_would_strongly_disrecommend:z._mukherjee_"mom_of_two_boys"	It sounds like a good system if it worked. You cannot use this system or the indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet have: a wireless computer network, or a cordless phone (2.4 GHz), or a microwave that is running. I'm not kidding - I can't believe this even passed testing. I think MobiCam has a newer system that you should investigate owning. Those have lots of reviews. Pay attention to them	0
B00004SABJ:worst_binoculars_i_have_ever_owned:arren_d._dorman_jr._"specializing_in_cold_hard_facts"	The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.	0

6604	This was the best item I ever bought for my camera. I do a lot of walking with my camera, and thought I would use it as a walking stick, which I do, but the best part of this monopod is what I never thought would happen. My pictures are NEVER fuzzy! I can take low light photos and have they come out clear. I paid very little for this item and would never be caught without it and my camera. The three levers on the bottom allow for quick expansion at all different lengths. The carrying case allows for this item to be packed next to my camera without it getting scratched	1
16371	The controls are a little complicated to get used to, especially the all-manual settings -- which should by definition be easy to use -- but overall this camera is very rugged and very capable.  After I bought it, I took the D10 to Budapest, Hungary.  I had a great view of the Danube and set my camera up for night shots.  It did a brilliant job.  How about this:  take a digital night shot (use the largest image size possible), use a 300mm lense and blow the results up to 24x30 through Shutterfly.com. Image remained amazingly sharp. Colors were fantastic.  The camera made it easy to look like a pro. The only gripe I have with this camera is that I wish it had a black and white setting like other less expensive Canon digitals, but this can be overcome with software so it's not a huge issue.  The price is great, it has a magnesium body (vs. the Rebel's plastic body).  You get a lot of the D1/D20/D30, without the cost	1
23801	This is a very powerful flash unit that works as a master to other Canon flash units. You can get very nice results with a small amount of experimentation. It does what it suppose to. I used it with the 420EX I've had for several years and it worked fine. Mounted on the camera it's a larger version of the built in popup on the 30d with some extra niceties and lots more power. Thinking of the 430EX? Cough up the few extra bucks for this baby, you'll be glad you did. It's a one shot deal, [no pun intended], you'll be using it for years to come. I bought the 420EX for my Elan II E about 6 years ago. It's been a great unit. This one recharges  faster and has gobs more power. You'll love it! Don't let all the dials and switches scare you, read the instruction manual	1
38148	I have been using my Sony Cybershot DSCN1 8.1MP for about a month now. It's so easy to use.  And, I love how you can easily delete picture via the touch screen.  The only issue I have with it, is that I can't use the Memory Pro Stick with my Sony photo printer (a 5 year old model), because the stick is not compatible.	1
47985	This is a great camera.  Plenty of resolution. Excellent shot speed.  Sturdy frame.  The kit lense doesn't do the camera justice.  Buy the body separate and add a better lense.	1
55645	I am very happy with this set of filters. The price was right and they come with a carry case so you dont have to worry how you are going to carry them if you go lite, camera and filters	1
60840	I bought this lens on a whim to see what it would be like to shoot with a prime lens. At $80 it certainly was worth the risk unlike the many other Canon lenses which cost thousands of dollars. The quality of the pictures from this lens is the only thing making me move away from zoom lenses	1
62934	I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
69944	The case opens partially on the side to allow removal of the camera only. Then after unclicking the fasteners you can unzip the rest of the case to allow for access to lenses. It makes it easy if you only want to remove the camera. You can swing the bag around while wearing it and pull the camera out without taking off the pack.	1
73193	Make sure to check the compatibility charts to verify that your lenses will work with this before buying it since only a handful of L series lenses are compatible.  If you do already have one or more of these lenses though this is a nice addition.  The AF only works with lenses f/4 and faster on most camera bodies.  You do also give up a little image quality by putting this between your lens and camera body, but the extra reach is really nice	1
76946	It's good as my title says, however, I found one con about it is there is no place I can put a string on it so that I have to put it in my pocket when I take it off	1

106203	Slightly smaller than the charger that comes with the S(40,45,50,...) series cameras and the digital rebel series cameras.  Seems to charge in about the same time.  Feels a bit more substantial, but that's not saying much as the chargers that come with those cameras seem pretty flimsy.  I can't give it 5 stars because it does nothing more than the chargers that come with the cameras (which I lost)	1
125589	Hoods offer several benefits to the photographer. Primarily the hood shades the lens from stray light that may result in an unwanted discoloration or hazing of the image, or the appearance of lens flare. Shading your lens helps improve contrast and image quality. A hood is not required to eliminate these problems, as any item used to shade the lens will provide the same protection from stray light. The hood is convenient in that it is built to offer protection while ensuring that it will not inadvertently find its way into your image.	1
130888	I'm new to the digital SLR world. I had been using the built in flash on my Rebel XT. The built-in flash had done alright, but was nothing to write home about. Since I had spent most of my money on the camera, I needed a flash that was both affordable and would get the job done. This flash met both requirements. IF you are an advance user, you will want a higher end flash because the flash has limited adjuastable features. Yet, if you a newbie like me, this flash is GREAT! It has improved my picture quality dramaticly.	1
143143	I am 67 years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera. I have had all types of cameras over the years, mostly 35mm film Canon slr's. I too bought all sorts of these 5-7 MP point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love, SLR's. I have had my digital Canon Rebel XT about a month now and I can't keep my hands off of it. It lacks nothing. Although the kit lense is good, I bought a 28-135 Canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo's with it. I love the way you can use the 7 points to focus, I mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture. I guess the nicest thing for me is that I now don't have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on QVC or HSN that has a "wonderful" new feature like "low light or non-shake." This Canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can't outgrow it. Its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be, it won't hold you back. The battery life is great, the built in flash is good but I bought a 430EX and that's even better. I never figure I'm wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come. I always missed my 35mm Canon slr's and now feel that I have an old friend back again, only much much better. Believe me, you can't go wrong getting this camea, its beyond description...	1
146780	I have owned this camera for about two months now and have taken about 100 photographs (keepers) to date.  Because I have been involved in photography for almost 35 years, I have developed certain prejudices. In particular, I have never been comfortable with auto exposure and even less comfortable with auto focus. In fact, the last auto focus camera I owned was a Nikon N8008s that I ultimately sold at auction because I could not adapt to using the various auto settings.	1
162139	This monopod does a great job for my camera. You have the quick, easy-off, it attatches to your camera by a screw, and you can press the button on the side of the monopod and just slide your camera right off of it quickly. I wanted a nice, inexpensive monopod for my new zoom lense. I have a Canon 35mm, and I recently purchased a 75-300 zoom lense for it, and I needed a monopod to stabilize the shoot. If I knew then what I know now, I would buy it again. Nice product	1
172908	I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon.  Having read the customer reviews, I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS.  Three shots each at f-stops 5.6, 11, and 20, one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200.  Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera, highest jpeg setting. After shooting both series, I compared them fresh out of the camera, side by side.  Results:  the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances.  It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20, (the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10), and at 20, it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background.  The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise.  Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop.  There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider; different test scenes conceivably produce different results.  My conservative conclusion:  the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon (unless you are going to drop $2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it), and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage.  Between these lenses, its a tradeoff---an extra 65 mm of focal length (105 mm after a 1.6 conversion) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability. Both lenses focus quickly and silently, and both lenses produce usable shots.	1
183080	I was able to scout out the different case options for my Sony DSC-N1. After much review, I asked my wife for her opinion and she picked the LCS-NB. It holds the camera nice and snug but you could work in a memory stick or battery. So far, so good	1

193925	This camera does all that Canon says it does.  Fantastic pictures.  Great flexibility for manual control or simple point-and-shoot use.  I did a lot of research before buying, and I could not be happier with the Canon G6	1
210787	Well, I've had my Rebel Xti for about 6weeks now, and all i can say is wow!!! I did have the Rebel Xt, which was an awesome camera.  I'm not a professional, but i do take pictures of what ever it may be outside or inside, youth or adult events as a hobby.  This camera is not for the person who wants to just point and shoot or to have a camera to stuff in your pocket.  This camera is for the creative person who wants control of the pictures they are taking.  The sensor cleaner and wide LCD are just a few of the wonderful advances from the XT to the XTI. The camera for me is easy to use and takes great pictures in auto mode or in my mode.	1
217131	Easy to use, including zoom and uploading to computer.  Nice clear photos when printed out	1
226760	For its time and price (at the time), a fantastic camera.  6.3 MP is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi-pro (non-studio) work, and this camera works very well with what really matters:  Canon's fantastic lenses.  Battery life on this camera is very good.  The "shutter lag" (between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo) is fairly well non-existent, and the only real lag I have is when I am shooting multiple photos in RAW format.  As most photographers know, the lens is almost more important than the body, and outside of Leica lenses, I don't think anything really competes with Canon's line.  The 18-55 lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work...I used it at the beach, and on hikes with my dog, when I don't want to lug around my bigger, more expensive, higher-quality lenses.  But for $75 or so, you can have a 50mm 1.8 EOS lens, which will supplement the 18-55 nicely, particularly for night photography.	1
233487	Am very pleased with all aspects of the camera except one.  I do not like that the viewfinder is no longer operational once you flip open the LCD screen.  Sometimes I like to verify my shot with both	1
243252	This tripod was a total shock! I was amazed at the quality, stability and portability. The heavy duty denier carrying case is a great bonus. The level and quick release were also a welcome surprise. This was the best $9.00 I ever spent for photography accessories.	1
251911	Since this is my first digital camera, I really can't compair it to others out there.  However, it does everything I need it to do and has more features than I make use of!  I've never had a problem with it	1
260405	Well, besides a whole bucket full of money, one of them lets you take photos in lower light, okay, that's obvious. The 16-35mm is a bit heavier, but not so you'd notice, unless maybe you were carrying it around all day, without eating and you're a bit over the hill. So why pay the extra money, unless, of course, you do a lot of shooting in the early morning and late evening?	1
264887	The Canon RS-60E3 is all that Canon says it is....it is a simple one handed operation switch that can open the flash, focus, then release the shutter once, a multiple of times, or hold it open for bulb exposure.  Although the cord is not long enough to include the photographer in the picture, it was simple enough to make an "extension" that allows for very remote exposures	1
272473	Fits my Canon SD550 perfectly and no complains abt that. The quality of the product is pretty good. When used with the belt clip, its easy to open and easy to put the camera back.  Camera seems very secured when used with the belt clip.	1
277743	I, like many people, research high-tech purchases before buying because of the complexity of the items and the invariably high cost of some of the items.  Digital cameras are no exception.  I was looking for a replacement for my KonicaMinolta Dimage Z1.  My requirements were fairly straight forward:  the new camera had to have a 10x zoom, no less than a 5mp processing chip, and third, get my photography skills to the point that the camera after this new one could be a DSLR.  I have read the reviews here on Amazon regarding the performance of the S9000, and while some of them, I felt, were right on, others did not read the professional reviews before purchasing this camera.  The intended use of this camera has never been a point and shooter.  While the S9000 does possess automatic functions to "streamline" use, these features are whoafully inadequate for the overall optical and proccessing capibilities that Fuji strove for in it's design.  Let me for clarifications' sake say this loud and clear:  IF YOU WANT BREATHTAKINGLY BEAUTIFUL, CLEAR, VIBRANT PICTURES WITH PERFECT EXPOSURE USING THIS CAMERA, THEN YOU MUST USE THE MANUAL SETTINGS.  THIS IS NOT A POINT AND SHOOT TYPE OF A CAMERA!!!!!!  Out of the box the S9000 has been a Godsend.  Not only are the images super sharp with no hint of edge fall off that hampers other high res cameras, but the exposure is so perfect that I question my ability for luck.  The setups are very easy and the controls and functions are a snap.  The white balance and shutter speed settings are not easy concepts to grapple with in potography, and yet Fuji has made short work of them with their intuitive design.  There really are two photographic miracles at work in the S9000:  one, is the processor that captures detail and color that you feel guilty for paying so little for something that is better than much more expensive equipment, and two, is that the exposure is so good that if I did not know better, I would think that I was using an advanced film SLR.  This is an absolute rave for this product.  The fit and finish are superb, ergos are comfortable and controls easy to find and use, and it fulfilled my need for a camera that would get me ready for a DSLR but not be too complex.  The only downside to this camera is that it will take time to process the image before exposure, but outside of some DSLRs, this is a problem with all digital cameras.  It is true that this camera is big and heavy, but then photographic perfection ain't free.  Home Run FUJI!!	1

287732	The other day I used a friend's standard digital camera for a little while. The whole time I found myself missing the manual zoom, instant response and convient manual buttons on my D50. This camera takes amazing pictures. As an dSLR beginner I used the camera in Auto mode for the first several weeks, now after reading some books on photography I'm slowing starting to use the manual features. The D50 lets me choose the level of control that I'm comfortable with, from full manual to full automatic; and both options are just a turn of the dial away.	1
297209	I have been working for a major daily newspaper in Baltimore for 2 decades. Perhaps that will qualify me as an expert in photography. I have been shooting digital imagery since the late 1990s. Maybe that qualifies me as an expert in digital photography. This may be long- winded, but it's extensive and can be useful.	1

310506	I purchased this lens to take photographs of vintage wristwatches.  I use an original Canon Digital Rebel and the shots are really very detailed.  It is easy to use in fact, I can hand hold the camera and capture the details in the hand-made craftsmanship of the watches.  Its F2.5 opening is a welcome change when you are use to shooting with a zoom lens and it is quite sharp edge to edge.  If you own a Canon digital SLR and want to pocket some extra coin then this is the lens for you.	1
332910	Holds all my lenses, camera body, remote, card reader, etc... with room to spare. Compares to bags costing 3 times more.	1
339043	I love the new digital Canon. The only problem is it's not nearly as tough as it's film twin.  I had the camera less than a month when the pop-up flash quit working.  The Canon people have been great, and very helpful, but I'd rather not have had to send a brand new camera back to the factory.  The photos, however, are wonderful.  Film quality for the most part - printable and enlargable.  (It would probably be better to use the camera with a tripod when using the 300mm telephoto but I hike with it, so just remember to steady it before taking wildlife photos.	1
345641	Hi have a Rebel Extreme, and needed to use the high-speed mode... but the flash couldn't even vaguely keep up.  I was taking pictures of dancers, so needed a flash system that could keep up.  The Speedlite really does this perfectly - I'm able to take a rapid-fire sequence of photos, and this flash system is there each time.  I don't know if it really helps when taking a single photo, but if you want a flash that can keep up, this one is great!  I like it so much, I'm planning on buying one or two more for my next shoot, to run in slave mode with this one.	1
347005	Had the 70-200 f/4 and loved it to pieces with a D60, and now with a 1D MKII, but sold the 4.0 in order to pay for a 35-350, which is my work horse. Due to the push and pull feature however, the 35-350 gets dusty quick in good ol' Montana land, so it has to go in for cleanings every once in a while, and the f/stop isn't always desirable for certain situations.  The 70-200 F/2.8 is amazing. The twist zoom is a little close to the camera, so it takes some twisting of the wrist to get it where you need it, and IMHO, is a bit too much of a turn to be from 70 to 200 in the time one might need for extreme sports. (Rodeo, NASCAR etc) The clarity of this piece of glass just blew me away. I did a comparison of images from my 70-200 F/4 when it was new, and the 2.8 is still visibly sharper. I put an expensive filter on it, as my equipment is asked a lot of in very harmful conditions, and I do notice the slightest big of distortion with a filter, even though it is a good B&W..... so when I can, I shoot the lens with no filter if I require extreme detail. The 35-350L is nowhere near the quality of this little 2.8... if it weren't for the difference in distance, this lens would be my one and only. Oh, and I love the IS. As it is my first IS Lens, I treasure is, but know I will not buy another distance lens without it	1
350967	I needed this tripod to use with my 20X50 binoculars since the least movement with 20X magnification causes the subject to wind up outside the viewing field.	1
363113	Excellent choice to make a great job.	1
369592	In the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts, the D70s has fallen behind the pack.  (However, if that's the only measure by which you're judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars.)  Nevertheless, it's quite a good camera.	1
377461	This is a great lens. I do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens. It is not so heavy so I use tripod without using tripod collar (costs 119.99 in B & H). This is the best value I have ever got for a lens. Now I can't wait to get 17-40mm f4L too. You can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at f4 and f5.6, of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject.	1
389627	The new Nikon EN-EL3e battery is a slight update for the Nikon EN-EL3 provided with earlier dSLR models such as the D70. It adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery. The battery is grey to distinguish it from the black EN-EL3.	1
396491	I've had this camera for three years.  I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.  I put a 128MB CF card in it.	1
417856	I read many reviews at fredmiranda.com before I purchased this lens and I was not dissapointed one bit. I was lucky enough to receive a very sharp copy of this lens on the first try. The macro shots were very sharp and contrasty. The center part is already reaching near maximum sharpness at F2.8  Anything beyond F4 is tack sharp. Be carefull with this lens though. The DOF at F2.8 is extremely narrow. Don't mistaken the out of focus shots for being unsharp. Focus properly and crank up the aperture and you'll get some very satisfying macro shots. The only thing I wish this lens had was image stabilizer. Canon, how about a 100mm macro with IS?	1
428815	It was everything it advertised as being.  I can carry my digital camera and lenses as well as two point and shoot digital cameras.  Being a slingshot backpack, my back doesn't moan and groan as it did with other camera bags.  I like the feature of swinging the bag to the front and to get my cameras with out removing the backpack	1
432874	This thing is perfect for carrying your stuff around in a not-so-fattening way.  I hvae an external flash, macro kit, 28-80 lens, 50mm lens, 18-55mm lens, DSLR w/batt grip and 75-300mm lens ATTACHED all fit into the main body of this thing.  Everything is seperated by the dividers making me feel confident and safe while walking, hiking, biking, etc.  The addon pouches seem to make it a bit more bulking that you'd want, but the bag all by itself is fantastic and I can't recommend it enough - get away from huge bulky shoulder bags!!  Lowepro did it again	1
436972	This lens pouch is very durable and is of a good quality. It compacts down and does not have unneccesary bulk. Might seem alittle pricey but is worth it in the long haul.	1
452633	i have another camera w/ 12x optical & tons of features but i wanted something compact & ready to take quick snaps. this fits the bill. on my recent vacation i was impressed with how quickly it booted up and focused in to get those unplanned shots. the x-large screen makes it really easy to see if you got a good one and the image stabilisation seems to work better than on my previous camera (canon A80)...either that or my hand is steadier. last but not least - the battery life was impeccable. I took a nearly 200 photos, plus spent a lot of time reviewing and showing off pics to friends with no need to recharge. the battery is a 'custom' one which concerned me but the charger is VERY compact and travels well. it has integrated prongs that fold flat when not in use - no cables :)	1
466166	I own several Canon lens for my 20D and this is hands down the best.  I had a 28-135 which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews, and I got many excellent photos with it - this is distinctly better in all ways.  (Of course, it costs a lot more).  Recently went with the grandchildred to Sea World and I got 100% good photos, with several really outstanding ones.  It is light, accurate and has IS - what more do you want?  You can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it.  Bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment.  If you have one lens, this is the one	1
470583	Every picture of mine that included larger portions of the sky would have these stubborn spores on it. Pretty infuriating, especially when you got the shot just like you wanted it. Yes, you can always remove those on Photoshop (or cheaper yet, The Gimp); but isn't it cool when you look at a picture and say: "that is it, nothing to do on it!" ??	1
488839	This was one of the first lenses that I purchased with my Rebel XT.  Now after taking several thousand pictures with it I can honestly say it was well worth the cost.  I very rarely have any unsharp pictures with this lens unless it is my own fault by trying to use too slow of a shutter speed without a tripod.	1
490387	I have had 5 digital point and shoot cameras all a little bigger and better than the last. This is my first SLR and I am not in the least disappointed. This camera meets or exceeded everything I expected from it. Very easy to learn, read the manual and use the web site tuturial and when the battery is charged your ready to go take pictures. I highly recommend this camera	1
499855	First thing to do is to make sure which lens you are buying. The kit lens comes with Canon 20D, 30D, 300D, or XT is the lower version, non USM one. On the higher version USM ones, you will see the red color "USM" at the front of the lens.	1
504698	I had viewed concert photos taken with the S2 from a number of different photographers and they absolutely took my breath away. Saw the output of other cameras in comparison and they didn't even come close.	1
510167	This camera is really great.  I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a "loaner" while my 20d was in repair.	1
512241	Puts a protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion.	1
521938	I'm surprised to see that a lot of people only give 1* to this camera! I've had it for 2 years now and i just love it! Thanks to it, I discovered I had a real passion for photography... It's very easy to use and my pictures are great! When I show them, people usually tell me " you must have an expensive camera"... and i just show them my little Canon S500 and they are surprised with the result!	1
533350	Up Front: If you're considering this lens, stop considering  - and buy it. I had occasion to try the Tamaron Zoom in this range and noticed plastic-y digital qualities in some of the Tamaron's highlighted-texture areas. None of that is a problem with this Canon beauty. I am using it as my normal lens. The contrast is razor-sharp enough to shave with. It's graphic in monochrome and colors are pure and leap off the monitor like a politician attracted by a TV camera. It's also light weight and plenty fast enough with practically no spherical Abs....	1
541374	I purchased this camera a year ago (summer 05).  Definitely a great upgrade over the original rebel, although the new xti has a larger screen which is the one aspect of this camera that is not perfect.  There are other sites that will perform more comprehensive reviews of this camera, but after a year mine is still working perfectly	1
542299	Pros:	1
559359	This is an elegant leather case for the Canon elph cameras. It fits in the pocket easily. I'm satisfied	1
566575	I've had my D70s for about a year now, haven't regretted it for a second.	1
569399	I'm using it for a few months now; I haven't found a single problem so far. Earlier, I was using an old FinePix and the optic/sensor sensitivity was not very good; poor quality of photos taken in dark environment. This is not a problem any more. Also, I was impressed with the sharpness of photos of sport actions taken with 10x zoom. In general, I was pretty enthusiastic about all the features of this camera; it took me nearly 3 days to try everything out :-). Sure, there are better cameras on the market; however, considering the price it is just a great deal	1
577907	Compare to the Price of the product I highly recommend to any one who own Canon EOS camera...	1
587435	My first digicam, bought it 2 years ago.	1
595835	This is the first IS lens that I've owned. I had trouble justifying the extra expense but am now quite pleased that I took the step up.	1
604210	I upgraded from the Canon Digital Rebel (grey body) to this because I was ready to take my photography to a new level. One thing I like most about this camera is it's flash compenstation. I purchased the 430ex flash with it because I was tired of having to use the built in flash and always getting those hard shadows on the wall	1
B000051ZO7:another_great_bushnell_purchase:very_happy_guy_"-andy"	What's not to like? Light, compact and comes with the strap, case and wipe cloth.  They are perfect.  Keep in mind 12 power can be more challeging to hold still	1
B0000CCT5Y:price_and_quality:fernando_agustn_fabiano	This product offers a realy equity between price and quality, and a good results in photos	1
B000GHVZQ0:nothing_quite_like_it:harry_pandolfino	I'm a former 35mm photographer who's a little older and not as spry as I once was and I eventually got out of the habit of lugging a case of equipment everywhere I went.  I got re-energized in photography with digital but a small compact point and shoot left me wanting more.  Digital SLR's are pricey and as a friend pointed out I'd be back to lugging a case of equipment around me with her.  She recommended this model and the more I looked at it the more I liked it.	1
B000099SGU:solid_product,_works_great:m._rohde	Unlike many reviewers I am not diver.  I bought this to for the peace of mind that my camera wouldn't get ruined taking pictures of my son at the water park, pool, and beach.  This equipment exceeded my expectations with always clear photo and underwater flash.	1
B0006G3BHW:quality_product_but_a_bit_pricy:guest_"graph"	Has any one tried the compatible battery from power101? I can't believe the price. I am struggling btwn buying the sony brand	1
B0002OGJJA:good_deal:s._chow	Good camera for the $129 I paid. Does everything pretty well, and your picture modes are pretty customizable. Only qualm is it takes a second or two longer than I wish when the camera saves/loads pictures to the memory card. Might be a problem when trying to shoot consecutive pictures-- but probably wouldn't be doing it with this type of camera anyways.	1
B0007NP7ZS:works_well:john_s._davis_"steve_cat"	It is easy to mount and puts out a surprising amount of ligh	1
B00064O89Y:amazing_camera!:	I got this camera about 2 years ago because my sd 200 broke. It is soooo easy to use and takes great pictures. Its also very sleek and small	1
B000HATNH4:great_camera!!:t._lamb_"tonya"	I recently purchased this camera.  It arrived one day before I was due to fly out to Palm Springs.  I took lots of pictures with this camera and was pleased with all of them except the night time pictures.  This may or may not be because I am a novice photographer. Even with the night time setting my pictures came out blurry, but all others came out better than I ever expected.  I think once I play around with it, my night time pictures will improve, but straight out the box this was kinda disappointing to me.  No regrets with this purchase though.  Also, buy a larger memory stick.  The one that comes with the camera only stored 6 pictures and I had to run out and buy another.	1
B000M51NOU:good_hd_palmcorder:j._kim_"the_techgeek_man"	After a week of testing this camcorder, I found it good enough for daily use.  The HD2 does not come with an SD card, so make sure you buy one before or at the time you get the HD2.  I got a 2GB SD A-DATA and a 4GB SDHC QPI Class6.  Both worked fine.  The 4GB gives me about 1:20h in StandardHD mode, and 55mns in SuperHD mode.  I didn't notice a speed difference between a Class2 and a Class6 SD card using the HD2, I think you should be fine with an 8GB SDHC class2.	1
B000094Q6K:bit_pricey-but_well_worth_it!:	I've used all types of film thoughout my photography days and by far Kodaks treated me the best. If your out to capture rich, vibrant colors this is the film for you. So far I've shot 4 rolls of it and I'm amazed at how much the colors stand out. Its definatly the film I'll be using	1
B000HWS0PI:a_great_product:brian_erickson	The Philips 8-Inch Digital Picture Frame is an excellent, high-quality device.  Very easy to get it going - the included cable and computer software make it simple to select digital pictures already stored on your computer and copy them onto the device.  No need to mess around with memory cards - although the device accepts those as well if that works best for you.  Everyone who has seen ours loves it.  It looks great and the picture quality and size are excellent	1
B000HATNI8:love_it!:yvette_molina	This is the perfect camera for me.  I take alot of close-up detail shots and the images come out great.  It is smaller than my old G3 (which I loved, but was pretty chunky)	1
B0002X5Q72:great_value_and_more_than_a_toy:dr._i._t._r._cockburn_"iain"	Installing the software was a piece of cake, using it is quite another matter. The basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a PhD in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles, tweaks and options. First attempts? The moon came out real nice, but Saturn was a white blob with no fine detail. Nothing like type of pics that the super-whizzkids proudly display on the Celestron site. Will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well	1
B000HAQ8EK:excepitional_for_it's_size:a._canterbury_"al_canterbury"	I purchased this camera primarily as a back-up camera. But i find myself using it more and more inplace of my main camera.  It is a beautiful piece of work	1
B000MFA1NE:great_camera:kalyan_"nick"	I have been using this camera quite a bit and am completely happy. It has both point and shoot, and slr features. You can take quick shots or get started with amiture photography. The software was easy to use, easy to set up, and it works well on my Mac. It has the quality the you would expect with the canon name.	1
B000AXQSVC:top_notch_transaction:marianne_cadle	Outstanding service.  Product as advertised.  Excellent packing job. Arrived in record time.  Would buy again from this seller	1
B0009E3UUY:american_recorder_sib-100_photo_studio-in-a-box:giselle_m._kinsell	It's a wonderful piece of equipment.  Love it.  Wish they made one for larger objects	1
B0002HBOPQ:excellent_night_scope:catsaway9	This scope is one of the best Gen 1 units on the market. At 36 lines/mm, it has just about the best resolution. Most other units only have 24 lines/mm. The illuminator is bright (almost too bright), uniform, and has a crisp edge. It could be a bit larger, however, so that it would fill the field of view.	1
B000I4LEGC:really_cool:juan_f._rodrigues_"j-one"	A really cool digital picture frame, very simple to use and supports all types of memory cards even a pen drive	1
B000H72X7E:great_:graham_s._sherrington_"cyberphobia"	What a great little accessory for my camera. Could have used it in Seattle last month, boy did it rain	1
B000F6X7RM:first_digital:edward_a._kalabus	Got this camera because a friend had a similar one. The blue tooth feature is just great. You need a memory card to make if you want to take video's and store a lot of photos. The video's are not bad and pretty remarkable for a camera this size. All in all a great buy	1
B000DZDNOM:delighted_with_camera_&_its_capablities:doc_holliday_"john_henry"	After owning and using the camera for a month or so now, I am delighted with it.  I have only replaced the batteries one time, so don't know what the review hullabuloo about that was for.  small lightweight, many features.  choice of 6 meg, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 meg photos at fingertips.  What I really decided on this camera for was the MACRO capability as I take photos of very small coins, and must be able to get in within an inch or two to do that.  It preforms magnificantly.  My previous camera had to add additional lens to do this which was a hassle.  I love the Samsung digimax S600.	1
B00006CJJW:amazing_value:lance_davis	I needed an extra battery.  This whole kit was cheaper than the price of the battery alone.  In addition to the battery, you get a standard camera case (Retail $10-20) and a very nice shoulder bag intended to carry 2 cameras, accessories, and the portable Canon printer.  There is absolutely nothing not to like about this deal	1
B00028SR0A:spectacular_video_quality!:w._williams_"power_shopper"	I'm by no means an expert, but I really wanted a reasonably priced video camera that could produce the highest quality picture for the price.  I did a TON of research and landed on the AG-DVC30 after much agonizing over "to HD or not HD" as well as brands and features.  Based on all the reviews I read, this camera seemed to offer the most features and the best video for the money.  I have not been disappointed.  On my first outing, I took the cam to the Grand Canyon and Sedona.  Wow!  What incredible color and clarity!  I also really love the 16x zoom.  It's smooth and powerful.  I got great shots of the Colorado River from the rim of the Grand Canyon.  I'll agree with all reviewers that the audio is not great.  It is not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close to the subject.  If you're interested in good audio, I'd suggest an optional mic.  If you just want great video, awesome color, and ease of use, this is your camera.  At the price (plus the rebate) you really can't beat it	1
B0007WBRY4:magnifique:s._cabaruvias	We got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there isn't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film. We were aware of both of these complaints when we purchased it but we were certain that she could work around them. We were also aware of the battery problem, so she got rechargeable batteries. Awesome little camcorder, especially for the price	1
B00004UFRO:good_product_for_the_price:m._tsien	If you are expecting clear professional sound transmission, this is not it.  That's a wireless system costing $1,000 - $3,000.  This  system is strictly for home none professional use.  I think people were expecting this system to deliver the hi fidelity sound they hear on movies or TV soundtrack.  Professionals do not use this system.  That is the reason for the low price.  Home movies only.	1
B0006O4VNC:excelente_flash!:alfonso_celi_"aceli"	He adquirido este flash para completar mi cmara Evolt E-500 y considero que es la combinacin perfecta. Se requieren de conocimientos adicionales de iluminacin y fotografa para obtener las mayores prestaciones que ofrecen ambos equipos. Altamente recomendado	1
B000E95SQS:great_product:linda_mohr	Very speedy delivery. A gift for my daughter. She loves it. I thought we were to receive a free photo card but did not. Not really necessary. Did not know that. Still playing with it and having a blast. I do like that it is weather resistant	1
B00005LENR:for_the_price_this_is_an_excellent_lens:r._lorenzini	Picked mine up used on eBay for $180.  With the growth of the VR market everyone is dumping there old lenses.  You can get a used one for a great price.  This lens is great for the serious amatuer.	1
B0001GMITO:rechargeable_batteries:m._fazio	If you take lots of photos, rechargeable batteries are the way to go. Carry the other charged batteries with you in case you need to swap them out	1
B0007CZ7AO:good_camera,_but_with_a_lot_of_downsides...:mel_blanc	We purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky Sony DSC-P52, which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism. Naturally, only time will tell if this is any different, but in the meantime, here's what you need to know about this baby:	1
B000DZFUIO:now_discontinued,_but_worth_seeking_out:jerry_saperstein	The Panasonic PV-GS500 was discontinued in late 2006 in anticipation of Panasonic's new 2007 models which will be available in the Spring.	1
B000E65Y10:great_so_far:zone_864	I bought this camera to replace a 3MP Kodak CX series when I thought I had lost it.  My 3MP took great pics and I never had any problems with it and I didn't want to have to learn to use a different brands software.	1
B0000ET7MS:good,_soft_protection_for_your_camera:conrayber_"conrayber"	What I love about this case is its softness and its superior quality. It fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it. (I have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras). This one seems to be an improved model.	1
B00007JDRV:good_quality_case:x79red	I purchased this for my CanonS500. I have it for over a year now and it is still as good as new. Good quality construction and a great look & feel	1
B0007KP5VC:great_little_camera!:donna_l._shaffer_"gnomanclature"	Yep, we love this camera! Amazon got it to us just in time for our trip to Las Vegas and we got wonderful footage and great still shots of our trip. The still shots are amazing, you can really zoom in close and get great clear shots of things our regular digital camera couldn't. In fact we tested this and have proof, as we had both cameras with us. My son got a great close up of Star Jones from far across the gathered crowd, right up to her face as if he were standing right in front of her, and my photo from the same area is so pixilated and blurry you can't even tell what the subject was! I love that we have two cameras in one, video and stills, so we don't have to carry both. I really like that there is a separate card for the still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten to wipe the memory clean. We eventually got a longer life battery but the one hour did just fine on our trip. It would be nice to have a separate battery charger, but it really didn't get inconvenient, we'd just plug it in while we slept and we were ready for the day when we woke up. And the price was excellent for all the features we got. Yep, we love this camera	1
B000GTBD60:my_mom_loves_it!:darla_cotton	I got this for my mom when I got the Digital Frame for my husband it is very easy to download pictures on and she can show off all of her grandbabies this is an awsome gift for anyone the color and pictures are great	1
B00022VZ1E:perfect_protection_for_an_excellent_camera:d._buxman_"a_seeker_of_truth"	I purchased this kit, primarily for the extra battery, which retails for about what I paid for this item.  Having the backup battery is great, but I was pleasantly suprised by the soft case.  It protects my DSC-P200, without being bulky or heavy.  With the camera being so small, it was hard to find good protection without spending quite a bit of money.  The case for the memory sticks is nice as well.  It is easy to lose a stick if it's just floating around and the case keeps them securely.  All in all, this is an excellent value	1
B00085ESF0:best_idea:mid_"opinioned_gal"	My Fuji E900 fits perfectly and also the battery charger and extra batteries.  The front pocket for additional memory cards is a great idea.  Case goes on Belt or on neck strap to accomodate personal taste.  Very nice and reasonably priced	1
B000DZB8EY:awesome_sony_digital_camera_carrying_case:david_harari_"the_doctor"	Sony continues to exhibit the highest quality in their product design and manufacturing process. This case is very slim, compact, well made, and has a very luxurious feel to it. It completely enhances the look and attractiveness of the Sony camera it is designed to hold	1
B0009EJ92C:awesome_camera_i_like_it_!!!:federico_lamberte_"freddydude"	When I sow this in Amazon and read the spec. and everything on it I knew this is exactly what I'm looking for. It's portable, handy, and it's easy to use. The video has a great picture on it as well as the picture too. You can even download MP3 Music and use it to make music video, or any music of your own. Here's what you do,  Output the audio to a power Amp/ speaker so the performer will hear the music let the performer lipsink the music and start shooting the video. shoot different location at the same music and edit it whala you have just made the MTV Music Video	1
B00023JJV6:just_what_i_was_looking_for.:h._davis	I had been searching web site after web site for a system like this.  I finally found a site where I could purchase seperate parts for a comparable system.  However, the receivers alone were more than this unit( If you wanted a receiver compatible with a plasma).  This works great.  Could not be easier to install.  All components are in my basement.  I ran the eye through the wall and have the eye barely exposed through a single cable face plate, with the blue led light taped to the back of the plate.  The blue light still shines through the faceplate, which is perfect. The faceplate is just below my wall mounted plasma set.  No interference.  This set up allows me to use this system at just about any angle in the room and the adjacent kitchen.  Works great with a basic $20 all in one ir remote. Also, the customer service is like no other.  I had several questions and each e-mail was answered by the next day with great help.  Made this purchase a no brainer. This is one product that far exceeded my expectations even after reading all the great reviews.  I highly recomend this product.	1
B000E0I5AI:perfect_first-time_camera:r._cole_"new_momma"	I had to decide between this camera and a Panasonic.  we trust the Sony brand a little more, so we went with the Sony.  We were looking for an easy-to-use camera that we could just pick up and record our daughter...nothing professional but good enough quality to enjoy years later.  I also wanted a camera that could take still photos so we wouldn't need both a digital camera and a camcorder when we take vacations.	1
B000063W8P:solid:andrew_siew	Solidly built, this tripod balances well even when used with the heavier Sony Cybershots like the DSC-R1. The remote shuttle release button helps to further reduce camera shake, which is priceless when taking photos in conditions where camera shake is amplified (high optical zoom, supressed flash, etc).	1
B000FI2Y5Q:five_stars:robert_w._lyles	Great product, great price, great company, quick delivery.  We love the small size	1
B000GFZTQO:good_little_camera:k._burbul_"auntiechicken2"	For less than $200 this is a great camera.  It is by no means spectacular, but for the price, it does a good job.  I own a Canon Powershot S60 as well, and the Canon outdoes this camera in some ways, but it's not pocketable.  The F20 is easy to use, the menu interface is fairly simple and self-descriptive, it powers up and is ready to take a picture quickly, and shutter lag seems average (close to the S60).  However, the only way to eliminate shutter lag is to buy a DSLR.  The "anti-shake" mechanism is not really useful at all, it merely boosts the ISO to 2000 which makes the image unprintable (at least indoors).  I have yet to try it this feature outside.  I've also found that dialing down the exposure compensation helps with the lowlights, especially outdoors.  Manually setting the ISO from 100-400 will, I hope, make for more printable, usable pictures.  I had actually thought of returning this little camera, but then realized that I could find nothing, for the price, that would be able to compete. I really wanted a 28mm lens, only found on more expensive models like the Canon sd800is, or Lumix's (which apparently have tons of noise at low ISO's).   It's pocketable, portable, and with a little tinkering you can get what you want from it.	1
B000GFWFZ2:a++_service:michelle_l._mcintosh_"mmcintosh"	Received Camera exactly as described. Easy and smooth transaction would by from this vendor again. thank	1
B0000CCT65:price_and_quality:fernando_agustn_fabiano	This product offers a realy equity between price and quality, and a good results in photos	1
B000MUV6BA:my_canon_hv20_wow_moments!:c._williams	You can't beat the HD picture quality from the HV20 based on actual user reviews and comparisons with all of the latest models. While this is a single CMOS sensor, it is a true 1920 x 1080 HD sensor of the same quality found in the award winning Canon Digital SLR cameras. Don't be fooled by a 3CCD camcorder that uses smaller sensor sizes and must use "pixel shifting".	1
B00006B8ZD:too_small_for_s2_is:s._meads	This is a nice bag, but don't buy it for a Canon S2 IS it will not fit.  The product compatibility lists the S1 IS since the S2 and S1 are very similar I purchased this bag.  I can't even get the thing in the bag.  It is a nice bag however and have put my smaller Kodak camera in it.  There is plenty of room for a typical point and shoot camera and all of it's accessories.  Good quality	1
B000HWS0OY:philips_photo_frame:jim_from_va	This product delivers exactly as promised and we could not be more pleased.  The pictures are wonderful.  The initial downloading process was straighforward and problem-free. We actually purchased three photo frames for ourselves and our children and they love them as much as we do.  The slideshow feature is wonderful as well. Everyone of our friends that have seen the photo frame are equally amazed by this product as some were not aware that such a product even existed. To be sure, they are expensive but worth the cost.  We will enjoy our photo frame for years to come as we update with new pictures regularly.  Thanks to the folks at Philips for getting this soooooooooooo right.	1
B0007WK8KI:great_camera:jeff_henry	I bought this a year ago and have taken many great pictures with it. It's light, has many features and can be used as an automatic when all you want to do is point and click. I can't recommend it enough.	1
B000GHULTM:my_search_for_the_"perfect"_camera_is_over...:vladimir_ratner_"vratner"	At least for now it is :-) .  During the course of the past 10-12 months I have owned 7, that's SEVEN, digital cameras: Canon S230; Kodak V530; 5 different models of Casio's: Z60, Z600, Z850, P700; and most recently presented my wife with a red S770 for Valentine's Day.  I also had a pretty good chance to evaluate Canon SD450 (my brother-in-law owns one - it was actually a gift from my wife and I to him for his 21st birthday), Casio EX-S600 (a good friend of mine owns one), and Panasonic DMC-TZ1 (once again, a gift from my wife and I to my father-in-law for his last birthday).  If you read any of my digital camera reviews (and I've written a few by now), then you know that I'm not particularly fond of Canon's lately - I think they are overrated and overpriced for what they have to offer.  As I also mentioned before, I've tried several different Kodak models (and I used to work for the company too!), but all of them turned out to be a waste of my time, to say the least.  I became a big fan of Casio's, although not all of my experiences with them were great.  But being a huge gadget "freak" that I am, and constantly wanting new "toys", I have always craved for more.  Over time, my tastes in digital cameras have changed from having a simple point and shoot type of camera to wishing for more power and manual control.  So one by one, I returned/sold all of my cameras, and after extensive (and I really do mean extensive) research, I got myself an LX2.  I must say though that I probably wouldn't have without getting to know my father-in-law's TZ1 first.  I was actually quite impressed with it.  Powerful zoom, sharp lens, decent picture quality.  I also played with some other Panasonic models in various stores just to get a better feel for them, as well as spent a few hours on the phone, and exchanged numerous e-mails with a friend of mine who owns an FZ30, and who swears by it.  Unfortunately, LX2 was not available anywhere locally, but I felt that I got a pretty good understanding of what Panasonic's cameras are all about, and after some more thought and consideration, I went ahead and bought it from Amazon (nice thing about buying from Amazon is that you can always return whatever it is you bought, including digital cameras, within 30 days for a full refund, no questions asked).  I did know about the "Noise" issue at high ISO's, but it wasn't a decisive factor for me, and I'm glad I didn't pay much attention to it and got the camera anyway.  It turned out to be one of the best purchases I've made in a long while.  Here is why:	1
B0001DJSYU:i_love_it!:artistic_c_"christina_y."	This is a great camera. The quality is good and the camera is very durable. I've accidently dropped the camera several times, and it still works. However, I would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than 24 pictures at a time.	1
B000CD8BCY:great_camera_for_the_avid_outdoors_person:gina_prusinowski	I bought this camera to replace my 35 almost a couple years back.  I am an avid nature photographer so most of my work is taken in the outdoors.  After hundreds of pictures and all kinds of weather here's the lowdown...	1
B000051ZO6:great_for_travelling_light!:j._lutgen	Small and compact.  Let me see everyting I wanted to	1
B000A3A688:excellent_affordable_camera!_well_worth_the_money!!!:mgm	I have no complaints. I have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable, fast, and gives me crisp, quality photos! The only option I wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures, but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality. Blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot. Everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun! I highly recommend this camera (especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments, with high quality photos). Excellent camera overall! ;	1
B000051ZO5:my_dad_the_birdwatcher:c._wilcox_"girl_gamer"	I bought these Binoculars for my Dad for Christmas, and he is absolutely in love with them.  The distance it can handle is slightly above average, but the clarity is really where this thing shines.  Its very easy to use, and has held up reasonably well.  I would recomend it to the casual user	1
B0002E3WNQ:a_must_have:ed600_"ed600"	This is a must have item for your kodak dig. camera.	1
B000CCBFZK:works_well:ina_lee	This is a good battery and lasts for a long time. Good value	1
B000KNL05G:best_for_the_price:organian	purchased as a gift and well received.  seems to handle larger chips in a timely manner.  runs everyday, all day and no problems encountered.  displays vacation pictures clearly.  like that it is big enough to view across the room.  frame is more compatible with decore than the 7" model previously purchased	1
B0000965T0:excellent:yesminia_lozada	Is an product of great quality, is a kit complete kit of accessories for HP 435i Digital Camera	1
B00006J053:nice_head,_but_"tilt_only":dale_dellinger	This is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish.  There are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber.  I have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it.  I use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography.  The quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release.  I bought an extra quick release plate so I can switch between two cameras.	1
B0007RALGO:easy_to_use.:cpa_"tax_specialitst"	I purchased this camera for my son.  He is a doctoral student and needed to photograph items for his research.  He was able to learn to use it quickly.  The battery life is phenomenal	1
B0002R2838:i_love_it.:bradford_l._gough	I love this camera.  I have now traveled all over the USA, some places in Europe, and will be using it in China.  Lens is excellent.  I wish it were lighter weight, but can't have everything.  And this weight has certainly no been a problem given its zoom.  I have had this camera for over two years now and have no desire to switch to anything else	1
B000EN81ZE:super_digital_picture_frame:william_m._sutcliffe	It wasn't the easiest thing to transfer photos from a computer and to delete the "samples" on the frame was no picnic either, but once learned it becomes easier.	1
B000HAOVEE:great_quality,_size_&_convienience:maria_mejia_"pitahia"	I really enjoy this small, high quality camara. I purchased a 2.0 GB memory disk so I could take advantage of the 7.1 mega pixel.And I get great pix everytime.  I have lots of fun with it. Since its so small, it's easy to take everywhere with me. I also get lots of compliments on it's "Fashionable" sleek design.  I highly recomend his camera.	1
B000M4KXIS:great_little_camera:bhavya_k._desai	First of all I would like to say that I was very reluctant to buy a SONY camera. After doing a lot of research for my needs I ended up with Canon 800IS and Sony's new toy T100. Ofcourse canon has the best overall ratings for ever but I wanted a stylish looking camera for my needs. Sony T100 is the best looking camera I have seen. It's features are awesome compared to it's small size. You can take it everywhere. Big bright screen on the back clearly visible in bright sunlight. It takes good indoor pictures too. I tried to play with its settings for while and thought that camera was not good. But then the best feature of the camera made it a winner for me. The auto mode takes great pictures and no need to set anything. Sometimes changing auto ISO helped to reduce the graniness but to be very honest if you are not going to blow the image to larger sizes (which would be 99% of the time atleast for me) it won't make difference. Just Point and Shoot. You get a perfect image for viewing on computers. No complaints apart from optional docking station which costs about $80. 5x optical zoom is boon to me as 3x was merely zoom. Also zomming while taking movies makes this a small camcoder with 640x480 30fps shooting.	1
B000EOUL6U:in_the_pink:	The camera fits perfectly. The case is very stylish.  Best of all, its Pink	1
B0000632T3:excellent!:roberto_barros	Excellent! They have a really long life and are the perfect backup for your rechargeables	1
B000I1VJ6K:good_value_for_the_price:wendy_mahan_"barefoot_alaskan"	I bought this camera for my teenage son. The only problem we have found so far is that the battery life is too short. Other than that, it is a good camera. The slim design is nice, and the camera is loaded with features	1
B00006SNZN:bushnell_perma_focus_7x50_wide_angle_binocular_in_tanzania:t._greenwood	The Bushnell Perma Focus 7x50 Wide Angle Binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to Tanzania and the Serengeti. They worked perfectly for the application needed. A really happy surprise on just how well these worked. As we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in Land Rovers, the Perma Focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy! :-) The magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across. Anything that was outside of about 80 feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity. It really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw. By far, these were the best investment I made before the trip! I can't imagine being without them now on such an expedition. Really fantastic performance and a great value to boot!!!! The vendor was fast & flawless in the transaction too. In my opinion you won't be disappointed with these binoculars. Troy :-)	1
B0007KQWG4:good_product--terrible_instructions:sue322	The picture viewer is a fun way to carry lots of digital pictures in a small device. However, setting it up and loading it was a nightmare. I spent hours writing to tech support and ultimately on the phone to figure out how to move the pictures from my computer to the device	1
B000LXZKQK:excellent_image_quality_with_superb_18x_optical_zoom_with_optical_stabilization,_but_no_high_speed_usb_and_mediocre_software:tennyson_lee	Images from this camera are very high quality.  The 18X optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes.  The optical image stabilization system (based on stabilizing the CCD image sensor instead of lens elements) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances (moving car, boat, shaky hands).	1
B000H9054A:good_value!:s._mann	I've been using 35mm SLR cameras for over 30 years. For the last 9 or 10 years I have gone through several under $400 digital cameras as the technology has improved. This Kodak Z710 is a very economical compromise.  The built-in 10X optical zoom is a great feature.	1
B0007U00XK:10mm!:some_guy	Shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways, but the sensor crop kills my wide-angle capability, which, to me, is absolutely awful!	1
B0007QN87E:great_quality_almost_a_stolen_price:s._gale	I just bought this for about $190 at the local PX.  I am impressed so far.  I was going to buy the GS180, but for the sale price I would be crazy to pass this up.	1
B00007I6FO:charger_is_almost_exact_replacement:chick_doc	The changer performs perfectly.  I was surprised that the price was so high for such a simple gadget.  The only other drawback is that the cord is not as long as the original, about one foot shorter.  Other than that, it is fine.  I gave my original changer to my daughter, whose charger died just before leaving the country	1
B000I1VEWO:good_quality_for_the_price:jim_the_tool_man_"newhandyman"	easy to use. produce pretty good quality.	1
B000063W8Q:vct870rm_tripod:larry_j._hutton	Great tripod. We're using it in a television studio w/Sony VX-2000 cameras. They work great	1
B000BOJYHU:picture_this:suzanne_lisa_kohr_"suzanne_kohr"	Was pleased to receive the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens and at a huge discount compared to other merchants. I do freelance photography and purchased this lens to use with the KODAK P712. The Kodak P712 is a great camera and takes excellent pictures. By adding the Kodak Schneider-Kreuznach Xenar 1.4x 55mm Telephoto Lens to the P712, it makes already great pictures even better, and what clarity. I recommend this product to everyone!	1
B0009VEG4Q:tailor_made:j._otoole	Fall through Spring I always carry my R817 in coat pocket when I go out. This jacket fits my camera like a glove. Allows access to all controls and LCD display through clear, heavy duty plastic film, once flap is opened. Open flap allows lens to zoom while still protecting rest of camera. Only time I  zip open jacket is to remove memory chip or change battery, otherwise, I just leave jacket on camera at all times.	1
B00009V4G6:it_works!:starpaq	I had a previous generic charger that did not work. Well if you go with this one, you won't have to worry about that.  This one works like a charm and seems to charge pretty fast too.  I've had this for a while now, and never had any problems with it.	1
B000LY6AXQ:works_great:jason_c._ditz	When I first opened up the "Super Quick Charger" I was a bit put off... it's small, it's cheap looking... compared to the old NiCd charger I used to have it was very unimpressive. Then I plugged it in.	1
B00065L5TO:great_for_fun_in_the_sun!:las2381	I took this case with me to my trip to New Zealand and it allowed me to take amazing pictures of rafting and cave tubing.  If I didn't have this case I would have missed out on amazing shots.  It's a great way to protect your camera from sand as well.  I loved it so much I actually bought one for my sister as well.  It is a great investment for anyone that doesn't want to worry about their camera getting ruined and also wants to take amazing underwater pictures and videos	1
B000IV2RW0:the_best_digital_camea_yet:k._arroyo	Very easy to use, multiple languages, something nice and easy for even unexperienced users.  Recommend to anybody buy it, it's worth it.  And the price is right for the features and MP.  I would not hesitate to pay more for this camera.  Kodak has done wonderful job with this on	1
B000MX0V9A:great_digital_camera:wagnelap_tam	I have received this camera for serveral weeks. It's a good long zoom digital camera. I can use it for 18x optical zoom when I set its photo size less than 3M EZ. the photo isn't blur as I use image stabilized. The picture is sharp. Image quality is good. However I have to set the ISO at 100 or 200. When the ISO is 400 or above, I can see the noise, and the picture lose detail. But every camera has its own defect. Overall, I am satified with this camera, and I am enjoying using it to take pictures.	1
B0000AJB80:exactly_what_i_needed_at_a_price_i_needed_it_for!:trants4md	I was very happy with the product.  It serves me well.  Fast delivery, good service by the vender.  I got the project done and it will serve me well on into the future.  Great travel storage case, Heavy plastic unit.	1
B0009XQPJ8:great_lens!:francisco_guerra_"fg"	Great product. Good value. Maybe a little slow for focusing, compared to my old 18-55mm Canon lens. Good quality pictures. Great all in one lens	1
B000246T54:great_monitor:j._h._kim_"baby_lover"	I purchased this prior to the birth of my son, and it's doing the job perfectly. I don't have a 2.4GHz phone at home so I can't say how it would've affected its performance, but video and sound are very clear at a remote location. I'm happy with the product and highly recommend it	1
B000FTLN02:definitely_improves_close-ups:tahir_j._naim	This lens is fairly inexpensive and the reason for that is while it definitely lets you get really close and the image is definitely larger than without it, the fact is the FZ7 and the FZ30 macro settings are already so good that the image is perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it.  If I can I'll post a couple flower images to permit comparison with and without the lens. The camera I have is a FZ7.  Because I want as large an image as possible of my focus I am very happy	1
B0007CG4LU:astronomy_made_easy:john_zimmerman	When the ETX-90PE works, it works very well and makes astronmomy an easy hobby to get into.  Let me elaborate.	1
B00006RJWD:requires_some_skill:n._rossino	I see a lot of people have had trouble tracking baseballs with this thing.  I've owned one for 3 years and it works pretty well.  I will give some tips on it:	1
B00005LB15:great_film:sally_ann_simmons_"captainl4"	This film seems a lot better than Kodak Max 400 even though it is basically the same thing (except for the fact that it's black and white).  I wouldn't recommend this for proffesionals, but it's great for the average person	1
B00078JT0C:simple_yet_effective:l._t._beasimer_"lb"	This seemingly simple piece of molded plastic was recommended to me by a professional photographer.  Basically it's the shape of an open box that slides firmly onto the flash.  It is small and sturdy enough to stash in your camera bag without worrying about damage.  When used the light disperses more evenly and is less harsh on the subject being photographed.	1
B000MXMP1W:amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:c._charland	I love this camera!  I shake when I take pictures and this Easter every picture I took came out perfectly!  There are so many options on this camera I am having fun just playing with it to see what all it can do!  I would recomend this camera to anyone who is looking for a high quality camera at a good price	1
B00007E8D1:sunpak_383_external_flash:p._marchitell	For the price it is a very good value especially with the capability of bouncing the flash in several directions.  Using the internal flash either left dark or washed out images at times.  This flash solves the problem.  I've dealt with ADORAMA several times and it was a pleasant experience.  Items were sent quickly	1
B000EIDBT0:incredible_performance:j._r._massague_"j.r.m."	Though being a Nikonist for years and knowing the possibilities of that camera I could never imagine the results and performance of this item, easy to handle,incredible small for the capacity and giving the same options to get the same quality of pictures than the D80.I have both	1
B000IHN8AO:the_best_dslr_in_its_price_range:y._lan	Before I get K10D, I experienced with Olympus E-500, CANON XTI, Nikon D80.	1
B000ECARGG:nice_case:g._peters_"ratedgap"	Not too hard and not too soft. Camera fits nicely, with compartments for just about anything you need for your camera.	1
B00006HYRG:a_must-have_accessory,_and_it's_cheap:gadgester	This lens hood designed specificaly for the Coolpix 5700 is a must-have accessory.  It does more than just protecting the lens, which it certainly does, esp. for those busy moments when you might bump the front of the camera on something solid.  (Don't forget Murphy's Law.)	1
B0009JQROU:raves_for_hp:lisa_higgins_"bearloverb4u"	I bought this for my mother...she loves it! Its easy for her to use and the screen is large enough for her to view.  The print quality is excellent.  I got more (merchandise and quality) with this HP brand than I would had with any other brand.  The price was excellent too.  Good job Hewlett Packard for making me a "smart" person	1
B000B674C0:works_as_described:siddharth_r._shah_md_"sidney"	I bough this waterproof case for a trip to St. Thomas over Christmas.	1
B0009K9Q2E:crazy_good_battery_-_it_keeps_going_and_going...:dom_miliano	I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months.	1
B0001HKIJK:nikon_8_x_40_extreme_atb:s._j._tkacs	THE BEST BINOCULARS I HAVE OWNED,AND I HAVE HAD MANY. EXCELLENT CLARITY,GREAT FIELD OF VIEW TOO. NICE SIZE ALSO NOT TO BIG, NOT TO SMALL. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS FINE SET,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
B000GHVZPQ:can_be_noisy_-_but_can_also_be_great.:bonner_photographic	Reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools.  An imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer.  I am not a master, but I do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are.  When you use ISO settings higher than 200 you will see increased noise.  I think it is a great little camera and I have used it a lot on my latest photo project.  Keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size.  This also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability.  There is no way to compensate for this in the camera - so know this is a limitation and deal with it.	1
B000BMVIT4:clearest_pictures_ever!!!!__great_gift!:faithful_shopper_"jzk"	My husband is away (military) and I was looking for the perfect, small but clear, pictures for him.  I didn't care about the frame, only the small white digital system.  I was hesitant, as my MIL has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible.  I was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an SD card and transferring pictures from the computer.  I love that I can use either batteries or the included plug.  Everything was soooo easy that I did not even need to read the instructions to begin.  I also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later.  This is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable.  Perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are!  Then, when he comes home, it's great for a portable album to carry anywhere	1
B00004TWLY:good_film,_but_prices_here_are_way_too_high.:	For an all-purpose color film, I nearly always shoot Fuji's 200 speed.  It has the cooler tones that I prefer in my images and a good saturation level.  The only drawback that I've seen while looking at various film prices here is that they are way over-priced!  The only place that I've seen where you pay more for film is in the supermarkets.  Any regular camera store or photo finisher will have this stuff for a lot less, and you won't have to wait for it to ship	1
B0007CGXU2:good_camera,_lots_of_features:walleecee	This is a pretty good camera, loaded with lots of features.  The pros include the 10x optical zoom, use of SD card, and battery consumption.  Also, with this camera you have the ability to buy add-ons such as zoom lenses and such - makes it nice for those that are just past beginner experience.	1
B000EHIQ00:has_anyone_actually_purchased_this_camera?:martyz	I'd love to read a review from anyone who has purchased this camera, the Aiptek Zoom DV-6 MP Image Stabilizing Camcorder w/3x Optical Zoom.  I see the claim that it has 3x OPTICAL zoom and cannot help but question this because I am unable to find this product on aiptek-dot-com and this cam has supposedly been available since July 30th, 2006.  Am wondering what gives with that?	1
B000205J36:better_get_good_lighting:ms._sanchez	Well, this lens does work wonderfully to expand your angle for better shots, but if you don't have good lighting, you end up with pictures that are worthless.  I suggest never using this in poor indoor lighting as the flash that comes on the DX6490 does not clear the top of the wide angle lens and therefore becomes useless.  Best for outdoor shots or areas where overhead and backlighting are sufficient enough to take pictures without the use of a flash.  Plan ahead before just attatching the lens and taking pictures.  Also remember that because you can't use the flash option, you will need to stabilize the camera better to avoid blurry shots.  Otherwise, this lens is excellent.  It fits easily into my camera bag, is simple to attach (with the lens converter of course) and takes great shots without the fisheye effect.  Other than the inability to use my flash with the lens, I think it is great	1
B0006ZF9C8:nikon_coolpix_4800_case_and_battery_kit:s._brown	This camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a MUST.  The price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores.  So, I look at it as getting the case for free!	1
B000AANTDU:perfect!:m._dinh	I've had this digital camera for almost a year. It's the fourth camera I've owned. I spent quite some time searching for a compact camera that I could carry everywhere. Being an amateur photographer (and mostly taking pictures for myself and not others), I didn't want to lug around an extra bag just for my camera. It fits discreetly in your pocket or a small purse (for formal nights out). The size and weight of this camera is its best feature, and this carries through to the newer generations of this camera, too.	1
B00008ZGSP:yes,_it_does_work_with_the_hot_shoe_on_camcorder:george_m._knochel	Some reviewers below have said that this microphone doesn't work with the Sony hot shoe.  Wrong.  Click on the "Technical Details" on this page and you'll see the Sony Camcorder models that this microphone works with.	1
B000M4KXCO:very_good_camera:r._stone	Camera arrived earlier than I expected, and was just what I wanted. Very small, but versitle. Large screen. Very satified with my purchase	1
B0002XRWSI:using_camera:arthur_crosby	Very good camera. This was a present for my wife as she needed a new camera. She picked it out and liked that it came as a complete kit. Directions can be hard to follow at times and could be printed larger. Takes some getting used to. Zoom lense works great and takes good pictures. Where the on-off button is so close to the shutter, you have to be careful that you don't accidentally shut the camera off. She is very satisfied with it.	1
B0000A0AIS:magni-ficent:nickunt	Proving that there's life in the old dog yet, Bushnell have come up with this, the successor to the out-dated, poor-performing Trophy Splashproof Spotting Scope, and I have to say, it's a fantastic improvement. As soon as I took it out of the box I was impressed with its styling, shape, colour, and of course, waterproofness. I set it up in my front room and spent a happy couple of hours watching my neighbours coming and going, and they were oblivious to my surveillance. It's not the most subtle 'scope out there but stick a blanket over your head and you're laughing. Any one who has been caught out in the rain will appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing, as water really does roll off it like, erm, water off a duck's back. Stunning	1
B000AANTIK:stellar.:c._osbahr_"design_student"	After springing for the Cybershot in August so I could have a compact camera I would actually TAKE places, I've been very, very pleased.	1
B0007M3PLC:little_giant:christopher	I've had this camcorder for a week now and I think it works great .. except for the touch screen feature. That takes a little getting used to .. especially when accessing the special features (such as fader effects) while filming.	1

B000DZDQ26:panasonic_pv-gs29_minidv_camcorder_with_30x_optical_zoom:chaitanya_pingali	Very small and easy to carry. Neat on the zoom, a bit hazy on the image stabilization but overall a good buy for the buck	1
B000A140H8:found_editing_software_that_works_with_the_jvc_everio_g:home_movie_buff_"sinoue"	Love my new JVC Everio.  The original model just used compact flash cards, but the new Everio GZ uses an ipod like hard drive that lets you store a year's worth of video on it!  Tape is definitely dead, and DVD camcorder's 30 mintues a disc doesn't hold a candle to the Everio.	1
B0007W4IW2:cano_10x42l__simply_the_best_binoculars_ever:r._k._jarman_"bjarman"	I have several different binoculars from small hand held to a large pair of Nikon's I use for wildlife spotting.    I have never had anything that performs nearly as well as these do.	1
B00004SABJ:my_dad_the_birdwatcher:c._wilcox_"girl_gamer"	I bought these Binoculars for my Dad for Christmas, and he is absolutely in love with them.  The distance it can handle is slightly above average, but the clarity is really where this thing shines.  Its very easy to use, and has held up reasonably well.  I would recomend it to the casual user	1

179562	I owned two of these EarBooms. The fit was comfortable and the sound very good. However, after a month or two of use, both sets cracked the plastic where the boom enters the ear piece. I imagine this came from adjusting the boom position, which put strain on the plastic. The plastic used for this is not strong enough to take the stress	0
187446	I purchased a brand new Samsung t809, and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone.  I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit.  The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit.  Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung.  I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that "the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty."  What?!  End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place.  Thanks.  If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.  Clearly not Samsung	0

263885	I bought these for use on my ipod earbuds.  I had an old pair (they were green) that worked great, but I lost one.  Within minutes of putting them on the earbuds, they split open - all three pairs!  If you're planning on using these for your ipod headphones, look into the older colored ones - I believe they're a different material and less prone to cracking	0
273596	I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his	0
384642	I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.'	0
418465	Apparently you need to &quot;know&quot; your technical specs -- Universal does not mean Nokia, so after getting the product and on the packaging reading clearly there that it doesn't work with Nokia, I get the expense of sending it back.

430809	Has to be the worst phone I have ever had to pay for.  Between the missing features (no voice dial on a $200 phone?!) crippled features (I have to buy ringtones, use their t-zone for the WAP when I have the unlimited internet service already?) and poor reception and terrible battery life it has almost made me want to pay the early cancellation fee and find another carrier.  Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business	0

B0006GWUT2:this_body_glove_can_easily_cause_loss_of_your_$$_phone.:lawrence_a_team_"a_team_member"	Whereas the body glove cosmetically looks good, it has a diabolical flaw inherent in its POOR design. The attachment button that is mounted on the rear of the glove that allows quick engagement and disengagement to the belt clip is seriously defective. The plastic button resides in a small pocket sewn into the rear of the glove. The problem is that the button flange that holds the button connector to the glove is floating inside of the rubber elastic glove. The pocket stretches! As soon as any pressure is applied to the phone when it is hanging on your belt (like when you sit down or bump anything), the connector easily (and silently) dislodges from its elastic pocket!!! Your valuable cell phone drops to the ground and you have lost it! You have lost your phone but the button is still attached to your belt clip. This is a dreadfully constructed device that the designer should be ashamed of. Use this glove at your own peril	0
B000GPNIV2:the_negative_review_1:jfc_"normal_guy"	Poorly made and weak. Pulls the battery off my RAZR everytime I disconnect it from the holder. Stopped using it within a day after purchase. There are better holsters for the RAZR on the market. Avoid this one	0

B0009N7OSO:good_idea,_bad_execution:boscodel	The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly	0
B000GWX888:i'd_give_it_zero_stars_if_i_could!:nicole_mitchell	PLEASE, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!  I have had this phone for 6 months, and I am SO disappointed!  Of course it worked for the first 30 days (within the grace period), but then I began having problems with keeping the battery charged.  I took it to the local Sprint store, and they gave me a new battery.  That worked for a few weeks, but just recently I've started having the same problem.  I just spent over 2 hours on the phone (of course not MY phone--I had to use my work time) with Sprint and Sanyo.  Of course, neither company was willing to stand behind the product, so now I have to send the phone (at my expense, of course) to Sanyo to have it repaired, which will take two weeks, at least.  So please, do yourselves a favor, and pick out a different phone	0
B000FOEN9U:lying_seller:eddie	I tried to cancel the order, but they said it has been shipped.  I was cancelling on October 13, 2006, but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17, 2006. How can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped	0
B000NJ5OO0:terrible_phone:brandon_pogue	I think this is the worst Nokia phone I have ever had.  It just doesn't seem like it's Nokia quality to me.  I would get the Samsung slider if I could do it all over again.  Battery life is subpar, slider seems cheap and breakable, speakerphone is not loud enough.  The interface is pretty smooth, but that's about it.  If you have to have a simple interface, then this might work, but otherwise I'd get the Samsung	0
B000KA18J2:junk:eric_moore	Snaps on easy but snaps off easy too.  It also takes the nice design of the phone that is easy to open and makes the phone really hard to open and then snaps off when you do.  This case also hinders comunications, maks you sound really muffled to the person on the other end of the line	0
B000A09UGA:do_not_buy_-_will_not_last:michael_r._martin	I know from experience. I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.	0
B000HJC56G:the_worst_customer_service_ever:philip_longobardi	I chose Virgin Mobile thinking they would be a good company. I have never been treated so rudely by customer service people in my life.

B000KNZEBW:this_phone_case_is_the_worse_one_ever.:mac_"4play"	This phone case is the worse one ever for the TREO 650. Yea the color is great but, if you just tap it on the ground or anything the color comes off wit ease.  The screen protector is not that great either.  A piece of plastic over the screen.... You have to lift it up so now you have a piece of 2 cent plastic over a five hundred dollar phone.  Not smart.  Now there was someone who likes this cheap piece of plastic over the screen to protect it. Quote "It attaches easily and I especially like the screen cover - most cases don't have this (if you drop the phone and crack the screen, you're hosed)." Well about this statement. Insurance!!! If you invest in a five hundred dollar phone then you must have insurance on it.  So, I guess you are not hosed in the end.  Final:  I am very disappointed in the cover and recommend that you invest in another product (leather).  I bought this item hoping to have something different.  The sale price is really what it is worth.  Six bucks....  $6.00 on a $500.00 phone.... My bad.. I really should have tough about this one and this is a warning to others.  How cheesy... I tough I was getting a deal	0
B000JDOIBK:don't_buy_from_accessory_export:b._ou	I don't know about other company, but Accessory Export will sell you the product that is totally different from the picture.  I bought a Genuine Contour Leather Case for Motorola Razr V3, but what I got was a cheap plastic covered with some form of soft plastic.  There is no leather on the case at all. Not only that, the cover smells like petroleum oil	0
B000A116AM:20%_good/_80%_bad:snow_white	We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year.  Very inconsistent service.  When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was "blacklisted".  After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500.  We were told it was "like for like" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand.  If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!	0
B000A116AM:worst_phone.__stay_away_from_lg_c1500+cingular:du_choi_"football_lover"	This has to be the worst phone I've ever owned.  I thought Motorola StarTac (my very first phone) was bad, wait till use this phone.  I have 4 LG C1500 phones in my family plan.  2 works ok but the other two, where do I begin.  First, it keeps complaining to insert sim card although it's inserted properly.  Went to Cingular store got the new sim card, works ok for a day.  Next day, same thing.  Did this 3 times and had Cingular send me the replacement phones.  Now one of the two doesn't complain about the sim card but occationally it says it's not in the network although it shows full bars.  The other one still have problem with sim card.  I just got the third replacement phone and now it seemed to be ok with sim card issue but can't talk more than a minute.  It just drops a call in the middle of conversation.  I now am trying to get a 4th replacement phone but not sure if they will issue it.  I am under 2 year contract and still got 14 months to go, what a nightmare...	0
B000FDVK24:no_connection_to_sony_z525a:timothy_e._nelson_"doc_10"	The USB cable and software did NOT work for the Sony Z525A phone, purchased through Xcingular. The phone will NOT connect to the pc. The phone does indicate that it is charging through the cable. Uninstalled the software and tried again, with firewall shut off. Same result. Connecting a USB device should NOT be this difficult.	0
B000KV26DS:yay!!_*pause*_oh.:s._turner	When I first got this item I was very pleased. It was so cheap and it looked great. It snaps so easily on and feels really cool. However, after about 3 weeks, the duller, not so shiny coat that I liked on the cover started to come off. Beneath it was a very shiny black coat. I was so disappointed, I took it off and went with my original cover. It looks really bad and just looks like something I've had for 3 years instead of just 3 weeks. I am very displeased with this item	0
B000K2GEJ4:be_warned:jonnyseed	USB jack did not fit my phone and had to be dismantled and carved with a knife to squeeze it in (it works now, but has to be held in by hand).  Came with no instructions, and, if you don't have a pretty solid knowledge of drivers, you won't be able to figure this out.  The driver CD is useless more or less, since they don't send you a "product number," which is needed to access the menu on the CD.	0
B000BQOOQ4:cheap:r._burkholder	The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top!	0
B000OYYHXS:did_not_like_the_krzr!!!:dm_"debbi"	FUNCTION FOLLOWED FORM On this one!! You can't see anything in the outer window, especially in the sun light. So you can't see who's calling or what time it is without opening the phone. It hurts your ear when talking. The buttons are difficult to push. It's my third Motorola and the prompts are different than others...Motorola should maintain consistency to keep loyal customers. Too many prompts to reply to a text. Thought the functioning of this phone was totally sacrificed for it looking 'cool'. I returned it and got my money back	0

B000HLYQNO:don't_do_it!:chad_a._turley	I bought this for my LG Mint Chocolate VX8500.  When you go to install the driver, you're supposed to select your phone from the list.  Well, it just so happens that the list is extremely incomplete, and my phone wasn't on there, which probably means that yours won't be either.  Don't waste your time on this cable and just buy the music essentials kit that is actually made for this phone	0
B000J0T6Q0:not_to_be_trusted...:dustin_deckard	When I recieved this item, I had mixed emotions for the product. On one hand, the black finish looked very nice, and the clear plastic covering protected the screen but was still easy to read. Also, all of the side buttons are fairly easy to reach with average-sized fingers (except maybe the camera button), so navigating the phone with the cover still closed is pretty easy unless you need to use touch functions or open the QWERTY keyboard.	0
B000J0T6Q0:good_case_if_you_don't_wear_it_on_your_belt:paul_ko_"gadgetor"	Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.	0

B000DZUJAS:waste_of_money:m._arellano_"gen_x__gamer"	I bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the Sony Ericsson Z500a (this model is listed in the description).  First off, the CD that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it, making it useless.  I figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from Sony Ericsson's website.  After downloading the software and following the instructions to a TEE, I was still unable to link up my computer with my phone.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case I made an error.  All told, this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with Amazon	0
B0000X610K:standby_loser:thomas_m._frier_"redleg66"	Don't waste your money. After 18+ months of service my original battery was nearing the end of its life. Instead of updating to a newer phone, accompanied by a new 2-year service agreement, I opted to purchase a "new" battery. Waste of money! The new battery offers approximately one day of standby power which means I must re-charge nightly. That was the same predicament I encountered with the original battery - nightly re-charge.	0

The phone works fine then all of sudden one day, 1/2 the buttons stop working and then when you flip the phone open the "#" is on the screen and you can't get to anything.... No phone numbers, no voicemail, no text messages, nothing!!!! It is extremely frustrating.  What is the point of a cute phone that doesn't work	0
B000EALK8W:useless_phone:glassyaya	I am terribly disappointed with my RAZR V3c phone.  I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features.  The viewing screen is so small that I can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size.   The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I haven't used the phone.  It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service.  I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I can't find any way change this.  I wish I had my old Sprint phone again.	0
B000GZ0AFY:bad_battery_bad_phone:s._bonewald	ahhh I see your battery is dying.  Be forewarned.  I'm betting this doesn't fix the problem.  I mean really how old is your phone?  Not old enough yet to have made this battery tired.  The Li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months (hence at 18mon a bunch of i-pod users are gonna get pissy when the i-pod doesn't work anymore and you can't change the battery.)	0
B0002UDTTC:short_battery_life:lesli_w._yager_"lesli"	I purchased this battery as a replacement for the 2yr old battery that came with my phone.  My old battery would not hold a charge anymore, so I wanted a new one.  The new one proved to be just as bad.  I don't think it's a problem with this vendor but a problem with the manufacturer instead.  Would not recommend ordering this if you're looking to replace an old one	0
B000199YRU:motorola_should_recall_this,_or_remove_the_battery--_makes_a_great_paperweight!:j._schwab_"kemoschwabbie"	My office has numerous i530 phones that came with our contract.  No person in our office has ever commented on how much they like this phone or its performance.  Battery life is terrible out of the box, the interface is clunky, and our personal phones with half the bulk have at least twice the overall performance.  If everything else in your life is perfect then this phone is for you-- it will give you SOMETHING to complain about.  For the rest of us consider other models or other manufactures to work with your Nextel/Sprint network contract	0
B000AMON38:i560_is_junk_-_3_phones_broke_in_only_3_months!:s._s._rose	I purchased 2 i560 phones - one for me and one for my husband.  Brand new out of the box, 1 of them had a bad microphone (you could hear the person talking, but they couldn't hear you).  Nextel & Motorolla wanted me to send the phone in for repair and be without it for 15 days - but I raised a stink and finally got it replaced (since it was broke from day 1, I didn't want a "serviced" phone).	0

B000JNSON8:does_not_charge_all_at_"once":l._stein_"angry_consumer"	Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer.	0
B000NNZT1Y:looks_are_deceiving:lewis_b._harris_"doornumber7"	I love the way the phone looks and feels but that's about it.  From finding contacts to dropped call this phone functions well below any phone I've ever owned.  I've had it now for 3 months and my frustration level continues to rise.	0

B000AXQFJ2:static,_static,_static!:r._hodge	This headset has a major flaw - the connections between the headset and phone are full of static.  The other parties don't hear it, but their voice is  constantly zapped by the static, and I'm asking them to repeat themselves. I've compared it with a couple other headsets I've got, and they don't have this problem in the same locations.  Actually, this headset has static problems ANYWHERE - office, car, out walking, you name it.	0

When it works the next day, it can not locate the offer number, nor could this rebate be located from the manufacture.

B000HLYPZI:great_cable_but_not_for_mac:a._gates	I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers. Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. The company I ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. Bummer. I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. I blame Samsung	0

The description stated that it would work for my selected model phone, however, it does NOT!!  The software needed to download the pictures is not correct. When we called the customer services they were of no help - they had no idea what to say or do to correct the problem.  Apparently I am not the only person to have this problem with the product.  Again, the cell phone models listed as being compatable with this data cable are NOT accurate.  It does not work	0
B0001NJFVQ:virgin_mobile=_poor_quality_phones:hellokittyluver_"hellokittyluver"	I reluctantly bought this phone because my Kyocera Slider suddenly died on me conveniently 3 months after VM's warranty was up and i had just purchased a $20 phone card + had airtime credits which were not refundable.	0
B000KJS8CI:pretty_good_phone_but_questionable_quality:james_f._haun_"jim_haun"	After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering.	0

I even had the computer specialist at work try and they couldn't even get them to work.  I sent them a e-mail to receive my money back, because I didn't want to keep spending money to send items back that don't work back.  Who would have guessed, but they never replied.

B000AML36I:horrible:w._clemens	I got rid of the bulky i355s at the end of our contract and bought two of these for our account.  We had to return the first phone (line1) within days of getting it as it would randomly shut off (crash), and other times the volume would fluctuate on its own.  Exchanging it was an ordeal with Sprint - they charged me for the replacement phone and still haven't credited my account after two billing cycles.  A few months later and now the second phone (line2) is crashing.  I'll make a call and hang up - and it shuts off.  Other times it will shut off in the middle of the call.  The other night I went to charge it and it said invalid battery - so I took the battery out and put it back in.  Then it said "invalid charger."  I might go back to the i355, it was rugged, reliable (but large) phone.  I guess I'll have to haggle with Motorola about getting this one fixed/replaced	0

179569	The compatibility with Nokia phones should not have to be listed because very clearly in BOLD letters-within the title-it says &quot;Universal 2.5mm Jack&quot;  Universal meaning ALL 2.5mm jacks.

435450	I've had my headset for about a month now.  As noted by another reviewer, this headset does not come with any buttons or switches - the only thing on the cord is a shirt clip.  6 different ear gels are included to accomodate different ears, which is nice (though I've only ever used one).  The headset is very easy to slip into my ear (only takes 1 second) and is comfortable for up to 2 hours of wear (at which point my ear starts to get a little sore).  My boyfriend reported a similar experience with other headsets that use ear gels.  If you regularly stay on the phone longer than 2 hours, it's something to keep in mind.  However, it suits my needs just fine, and for the low price, I think it's really a great buy	1

560953	Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome?	1
B0006GWUT2:body_glove_ii,_i_love_you:j._r._collins	I have had this for almost 6 months and I like it a lot.  Right off, it looks great.  Black leather, blue piping going around the edge.  The blue is that vivid color that one of those exotic/expensive fish tank fish have:  neons or tetras?  Whichever it is, it is very sharp looking.	1
B000EIU5ZI:rim_blackberry_7100_series_soft_leather_case:kevin_watford_"bidnessman"	This is a great product. The only area of improvement would be the belt clip. It is very difficult to attach to the belt. Over all it is a great case	1
B000F3491I:affordability_plus!__$3/month:p._mckenna	If you don't use this phone, it costs $3/month.  Normal hours til 9 p.m. it's 12 cents per minute, which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost.  Perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when I'm in transit and feel that I simply must know where they are and what they are doing.  I don't use cell phones much, but if I must have one, I might as well have one that doesn't make me worry about another huge bill.  For kids who think they can mangle the budget, forget it cuz when the card is used up -- that's it kiddo.  Once they use up the card, the only number they can dial is 911, but that's it.  Bonus features: clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day.  At some point, I might not be able to live without this.	1

B000FJ0HBI:great_holster_for_8700:m._dow	My only complaint, and consequently the 4-star rating, is that sometimes I don't hear the Blackberry or feel the vibration. Apart from that this holster is a vast improvement over the OEM plastic holster	1

B000FOEN9U:got_cracked_soon_:john_l_"jml"	The item by itself is perfect to protect the phone from Scratches, it fits like a glove , really nice , the delivery from Eforcity was really fast and well packed but it got cracked  after 5 days of use, it wasn't hit or treated carelessly. I'll order some more because they are really cheap and  it's better to have a cracked cover than a broken phone.Love how the phone looks in it while it was in good condition, the case started falling apart in cracked pieces and after 8 days I had to dump it.	1
B000NJ5OO0:3_months_with_this_phone_have_been_amazing.:jerry_n._strickland	I recommend this phone to ANYBODY.  I absolutely love it.  I have had it for three months now and not a problem so far.  The music player is great, and I swear...the camera looks ALOT better than 1.3 mega pixel.  The handset is wonderful, and so is the headset included with it.  If you buy this phone, it WILL last you a long time.	1
B000NJ5OO0:impressive_phone..but_some_quirks:c._murua_"silent_warrior_"	I just purchased this phone four days ago and have been impressed with it for the most part. The first thing you'll notice is how crisp and clear the screen is.  This is a slider phone, and thankfully you can do most things without sliding the screen to expose the number keys. The only things that I can think of thus far that requires you to expose the keys is to dial a new number that's not in your contacts and to text message.	1

B000659X16:old_faithful:swanky_"stephanie"_d	This Samsung is the most reliable phone I've ever had. I've had it for two years, dropped it NUMEROUS times, and it is still going strong with only a few scratches. The battery life has declined during this period of time, but it still lasts about two days before charging. While it does not have as many features as the new phones that are out now, I am impressed with how many applications I use daily - alarm clock, scheduler, memo pad, etc. Reception is usually good too.	1

The stitches are even and tight, good quality	1

B000KFWUMG:great_ppc_phone:f._scott	This is a wonderful device. Build quality is typical of HTC, meaning very good. The call quality is good provided you're in a decent service area (system not overloaded with AMR-HR kicking in). The scroll wheel is a very useful addition to the Hermes line and makes one handed use much more manageable. The slide out keyboard is easy to use and provides very good tactile feedback. There is a huge user community and a very large knowledge base to consult (this is perhaps the ultimate "geek" phone). The WM5 ROM it currently ships with is fairly stable and provides the usual suite of applications and productivity tools. There is a learning curve involved with Windows Mobile, but IMHO it's not nearly so bad as some ppl make it out to be. In general, things work as they are supposed to with this phone.	1
B000KFWUMG:good_and_bad:nikunj_jain_"quicknik"	Hi, I just recently purchased this phone. and so far these are the problems. Yes you do have to restart the device, it does get hung, but i don't blame the phone, after all it has windows mobile 5 in it. The restart has occurred twice to me in the past week, So be careful. This phone is pretty close to being perfect. Other than the fact that it has windows, The 3G connection is crazy fast and it is amazing to have. If you take this phone be ready to take a good data connect plan as even thought it has wifi capabilities, Cingular has programed it to first connect to their data connect feature.. which in return will give u a nice thick bill.. Once you buy the phone i suggest that  you get this software Spb Pocket plus. It helps shutting down softwares running in the background, and adds more features. The screen clarity is amazing and it has great features. It can connect up to 6 bluetooth devices at once. Overall i give it a 4 because of the hardware. the one star missing is cause it has Windows. Sorry Microsoft but you need to remove the bugs outta this windows too.	1

I expected to use it like a typical pilot, where you write on the screen. This feature is not implemented.  Overall, this is a very good phone. Good reception, great sound quality!! Speakerphone is great! Neat features. Worth the $$	1
B00097DIYY:not_the_typical_thin,_flimsy_screen_protector:t._j._kramer_"competent_reviewer"	These JavoScreen Treo 650 protectors are really very different from anything you've normally seen.  Typically, 95% of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen, hope against hope that you don't have bubbles, but you almost always do. When the screen is off, you see the bubbles, thankfully when the screen is on, the bubbles are pretty invisible..... BUT these JavoScreen protectors are a completely different animal.  They are thick, and tough, and relatively firm.  And because of those properties, they go on with NO bubbles, and they are easily moveable (adjustable) should you not get it on perfectly the first time.  Further, they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good.  This is the state of the art for screen protectors.  And this all becomes an even bigger issue for men, because of whiskers, over time the screen will get dulled and scratched.  Because of the thickness and quality of these, scratches to the screen are no longer an issue.	1
B000HLYQNO:works_well:ilya_pirkin	Works well. Driver installation is somewhat tricky becuase it is not obvious which driver among all on cd you have to install. No synchronization software is included so you have to use a third-party tool like bitpim. Which is ok	1

The price was right, set up was easy, and (with the Bitpim program) you can communicate with your LG VX8300 efficiently.  I loaded my whole Outlook calendar and contacts into the phone, as well as some songs, wallpapers, and ringtones.  Don't waste your money buying and downloading ringtones or music from Verizon's sites (VCast and such); just hook this cable up between computer and phone and load your phone up with the music/tones that you already own	1

B000JNYGOE:cellet_retractables_are_the_best!:jason_d._hochstetler	I have tried them all.  These are the best.  No more tangled cords.  I only look for Cellet when I need a charger.  I have delt with cell phones for over 10yrs.  Why pay $26 for a tangled mess	1
B0000X610K:contract_killer:michael_goldenberg	This battery saved me from renewing the contract,thus the battery was a contract killer.I thought I was going to get a new phone as this battery is 49.99 at the Verizon dealer. But you guys saved the da	1

B000HE8RI6:great_accessory!_almost_a_necessity,_this_should_be_included_w/_the_initial_q_purchase:lour101	After reading reviews here & "user forum's" I decided to purchase this	1
B000EGNSHC:nice_cover:nate_campbell	cover fits great and for the price i could not find anything better, was at the local mall and saw a cover that was the same for around $17. i would recommend this case	1
B0006N3LIE:swivel_belt_hoslter_for_audiovox_8610:f._brooks	Very good clip-type phone holder.  Came as advertised and quickly.	1
B000LGFPLW:i_wouldnt_want_to_be_without_one:g._davis	The touch screen protector for my 8525 is very nice. The onwly reason i didnt give it a five is that it has a tendancy to get dust or small barely visible items stuck on the adhesive backing and it is very difficult to remove so be very careful not to aloow any foreign objects to attach themselves while cleaning your screen (easier sad than done). If anything does attach, it doesnt seem to affect the function of the protector much but it leaves slightly annoying slightly visible air bubles trapped between the screen and the protective layer	1
B000H7D332:time_is_critical:j._schneider	When I first got my Motorola Q I was disappointed with the standard battery and was having to charge the battery every night or be caught with a dying battery in mid day.  With some setting changes and the 1700 mAh battery that is now far in the past.  For the price, it is an excellent deal.	1
B0009N549A:very_good_product,_just_a_few_quirks:s._camilo	I like this case very much for my Blackberry.  It definitely improves the grip on the Blackberry especially when I'm using it as a phone.  It also serves as an excellent protector when I throw it in my purse.  My two problems are that I wish there was more variety in the colors available similar to the Speck Ipod protective cases.  (Come on guys!  Women use these items too!)  Also, the rubber strip between the screen and the keyboard has become loose and not fitted to the Blackberry in the week that I've had this case.  Other than those two things, this is a great, not bulky case.	1
B0002UDTTC:7_yrs._with_nextel_and_lovin_every_direct_connect_second:jimmymac323_"jimmymac323"	An extra Lithium battery is ideal for the new i860 camera phone. The desktop charger comes with a second charging slot so you always have a spare battery ready for those last minute low battery alerts.  It saves time and one last thing to worry about. The charge itself is fast too..	1
B000BUOU4G:it_does_what_it_is_supposed_to:sunnyboy	What can I say?  It works very well - I keep this in my car so when I travel I don't have to worry about my Palm TX's batteries	1
B000AMON38:motorola_i560_vs_i710:t._snelling	The Motorola i560 is nicely sized, easy to use, and indestructible.  These features are what to look for when looking for a new cell phone.  Not only is the i560 smaller than most bulky Nextel or Sprint phones, such as the i710, but it is the unbreakable model with outside display.  This is something new for the unbreakable model.	1
B000ITVRQY:great_battery,_great_price:a._yamane	I just bought this battery at a Sprint Customer Service store, and I paid $64.64 with tax in California. I can buy 4 of these batteries here at Amazon. I'm going to return it today, and buy it online here. Should have checked first.	1
B000ITVRQY:samsung_mm-a900_extended_battery_w/door_review:g._middleton_"kingpindoe"	The samsung A900 Blade is an excellent phone. I can say so many good things about it. The only bad thing about it I encountered is the horrid battery life. And the battery life was a problem from the second I walked out of Sprint. Nobody wants to charge their phone between 2-4 times a day. With the standard battery in the A900 I was charging my phone a ridiculous amount of times. But that's what you get with a razor thin phone. So of course I searched and finally found this battery which was crucial. This battery is a life saver. Be sure to get this one because it was the cheapest I found, and I did extensive searching. Also this one comes with the door which is very crucial. I've seen some extended batteries being sold without this door and I almost made the mistake of buying one without the door. You would be screwed without a door that fits the extended battery. What would you do, put a rubber band around it? Heck no. Well anyway, now that I have this battery, my phone will last all day without worries of dying just like my previous models that had thick batteries. My A-900 is still very thin even with this extended battery that sticks out a little. Don't worry, you're phone will still look great with this battery and you will enjoy all it's features without dying	1
B000KHF7ZQ:still_needs_work,_but_overall_a_good_smartphone:andreas838	Upgrading from the Treo 650, it is true that there isn't much new. Also issues such as the horrible battery duration and non-megapixel camera leave one frustrated. But the fact remains that the Treo 680 is one of the best smartphones on the market, particularly if you want good PDA functionality or are a PalmOS devotee.	1
B000NNZT1Y:love,_love,_love_it!:computer_geek	I've had multiple PDA's that have crashed and multiple phones in the past.  I had a great Nokia phone, but wanted to combine into one unit so I decided to try the Dash about 6 months ago.  So far, I've had no issues with service.  Been able to make and receive phone calls, call clarity is excellent and with TMobile, I have service in my office unlike other co-workers phones.  Everyone is jealous - their pda phones are much larger and not as nice looking.  I really enjoy having the email and internet feature.  The only issue I've had at all is with the volume control - when I'm surfing the net or playing ball breaker, I hold the phone and often hit the volume control.  Everything else works as described and I'm very happy with my choice.	1
B000JUZDYE:good_and_solid:d._j._sun	After trying this phone out a few days here are my personal results	1
B000EIU40Y:talk_time_extended:bob_"bob"	The original battery never lasted an entire day if I talked very much.  With this replacement battery, I never run out of power anymore.  I do charge it every night. The battery is a little bit thicker than the OEM but it causes no problems when carrying it on the belt clip.  The new battery comes with a new battery door that matches and fits perfectly	1
B000M23P3U:great_phone_except_for_the_time_display:carleton_j._macdonald_"carletonm"	I just received this phone free as part of Verizon Wireless's "New Every Two" program.  My main gripe with the phone is that, unlike my former phone (Motorola V265), it cannot be set to display the time in the 24-hour format (I do not use am/pm).  Otherwise, the screen is nice and bright, it's easy to use, it's much less bulky than my former phone, and the voice activation is easier	1
B000AXQFJ2:can_you_hear_me_now?:thomas_macisaac_"sales_warrior"	I purchased the Logitech Mobile Traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product, but that's not to say that that the product is not without some flaws.  The reception, clarity, and battery life is quite good.  Also, my hearing isn't the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don't have to strain to hear.  My one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit.  I've gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on, but it's still very annoying at times.  Even with this slight annoyance, I would definitely buy this product agai	1
B000H6FNOA:it_works!:jeffrey_marinelli_"jnelly"	The charger works great and charges quickly. Shipping was also quick (3-4 days) My only complaint is that sometime it is hard to get into the phone and the cord is only about 3 feet long, wish it was longer.	1
B000KLZ2NY:good:d._viswanathan	Received the product on time and its working fine. but its a bit harsh on the ears	1
B000JIMDBC:great_for_the_cash:martin_sanford_"drofnas"	Not looking to spend the cash for Bluetooth, but need something to work? This is it. With the extra button you can answer, put a call on hold, or hang up without fumbling for your phone. Very happy with the purchase	1
B0007ZD8F2:my_baby_is_protected_now:make_cents,_inc._"virgie"	This cover is what my "baby blackberry" needed to be protected and safe	1
B000FYZ9TI:treo_skin:frank_reyes	The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick	1
B000K0X90I:great_little_phone!__but...:b._longwell	This phone form Amazon actully comes with the 64MB version of the Memory Stick Micro(tm) (M2(tm)) NOT the 512MB one pictured with the phone. It also feels a bit light in the bottom when you hold it open in your hand.. almost a hollow feel. But other that that this is a pretty cool little phone with a 2MP camera. It also seems to get really good reception as another reviewer has stated. The antenna is in the loop on the phone so you have to get use to not covering it with your finger. The way the phone is shaped you want to hold the phone with your index finger convering the loop which can lose reception...so you just have to remember that when talking to someone. The inside screen is really really bright! I turned it all the way down to save the battery and the phone is still bright like a normal cell. The Radio and song file drag and drop feature is cool too, especially if you ride the bus and listen to a lot of music	1
B000HLYPZI:there_is_a_feel_good_thing_about_this....i_am_sure_you_will_agree_with_my_conclusion...read_on:krishna_"review_you_can_count_on"	I like this for more than one reason...so read on,	1
B000M8PHLC:treo_skin:frank_reyes	The protective skin is a bit too thick for some applications (GPS car holder), but does do what is was designed to do. Solid grip, and non-slip. Would be nice if it was not so thick	1

B000LDQ1EU:good_cable,_long_wait.:manuel_noriega	The cable was perfect -- exactly what I needed, but it took way too long, over ten days, to get here	1
B00069IQG0:great_headset:bj_tomiko	Works great, its a bit bigger than some headsets, but in this case I feel thats a good thing, the microphone does a lot better job filtering out background noise and you don't get a feedback loop where the person you're talking to hears themself since the mic is futher away from the speaker.  The only complaint would be I wish the volume went up just a bit more, it can be hard to hear people sometimes while driving on the freeway if they talk too quietly.  One note to anyone buying one...  the hole to plug the charger into is under the thing that holds it onto your ear, it rotates out of the way.  It took me awhile to find it when I first got it	1
B000KFUK9Q:loving_the_bb_pearl:tannim_umoren	This is my first BlackBerry device. In fact, this is the first cell phone I've had where I had a data plan setup. I gotta say I'm luving it! My email gets to me sometimes even before it shows up on my desktop. The browser is very robust and seems to work great. I've installed a few extra applications (google maps, bbweather, and Yahoo go to name a few) and I haven't had any problems. The applications cover a broad spectrum of interests and are really useful. I still have yet to try the Opera browser for the BB. The camera is so clear with and without the flash it's scary. It beats my old cameraphone hands down!	1
B000KIBO4I:item_is_great:j._paulin	This product was perfect, all I needed to move pictures from my phone to my pc.  Highly recommended.	1
B000FYZ9SY:great_protection_for_my_treo:seth_g._charnes_"sgccpa"	I use this all of the time.  It gives good protection, ease of use, and good handling.  Only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock.  However, this is true of any protective skin.  Outstanding product.	1
B0001NJFVQ:very_good_phone:	This phone is great!  It has all the basic features I wanted out of a phone and I was able to fix the  low ringtone problem by searching for "audiovox 8610 hack" over the internet.	1
B0006FIP9C:decent_enough_charger_for_the_price:dallas_willett_"dallas"	I have a Motorola V220 phone and this charger has worked great and problem free for last three month.  The cord is about 3 feet long and it plugs in horizontally, which is nice in that it does not block the second outlet.  It's fairly light weight and made of plastic, but seems durable enough.  A small red LED lights up when the charger is pluged into an outlet, regardless of whether you're charging your phone or not.  I debated giving this four or five stars and decided to give it five based on the great price	1
B000GPNJI4:clear_case:c._clark_"on-line_shopper"	Product is ok, don't think it'd protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up.  But it is aesthetically appealing, will protect from small scuffs and scrathes	1

B000H95022:great_skin:family_of_four	This is a great skin for a Treo 700.  I have used this product for about four months, and had another brand prior to that.	1
B0007MTZ9S:great_buy!:m._stephens	You can't beat this price. This holder works great. You must remove your phone before answering it. Make sure you put the phone in with the camera facing the clip. I put it in backwards at first. The phone won't stay in that way	1
B000IZ78A2:very_rugged:well_informed_consumer_"evan_h"	I bought this case for use at work. I work in a semi-dusty shop environment. I'm always bumping up against benches and shelving and this case has held up very well. I don't have to worry about the screen getting scratched (The screen on the Sansa e2oo series scratches very easily) with the hard plastic screen protector. I am very pleased with the Speck Toughskin and have recommended it to several friends and co-workers.	1
B000IZ78A2:fantastic!:amazonbie	I really like this protective cover.  It is very well made, and seems like it will do an excellent job of protecting the Sansa even from a fall.  The funny thing is that now that it is in the ToughSkin I am much less likely to drop it.  Before I bought the ToughSkin, the my e280 was very slippery and easily dropped.  Now that it is in the case, it is very easy to hold and grip with very little pressure.  It is true that the buttons are easier to push with the ToughSkin on than it was without it.  The hard plastic screen cover was a surprising positive about this case as well.  The only problem being that the screen cover seems to scratch more easily than I would expect.  Overall, this is an excellent product that I would not hesitate to recommend	1
B000700JNG:perfect_fit:kenneth_i._eckman	I was a little skeptical about buying this case for my phone. I wanted a holster that wasn't a sloppy generic model that didn't fit. I was absolutely pleased when this one arrived and I tried it on my Motorola V180. It fits like a glove and looks good. No complaints here. So if you have a V180 and your on the fence about taking the plunge and buying this let me assure you, that you won't be disappointed. The added bonus is the money you will save over buying one from your cell phone dealer:	1
B000COY13G:works_great_-_very_compact:m._burk	This device works great.  I use it on a USB Laptop to charge the Treo 650. I also use it on a wall outlet and the car.  No problems.  The cords retract when you want to fold it up so very convenient.  It does not come with a case, so you'll use your own bag or whatever.  The part that fits into the Treo is very secure.  It does not pop off like other chargers.  The only thing I can see that could be a problem is if you are rough with the pieces or they are just loose in a bag they can get lost or possibloy damaged	1
B000GKTU82:motorola_q_black_skin_:j._sta_cruz	Skin was great and was shipped as described.  It really helps protect my Q. I like the texture of the skin,  feels like rubber.  Overall, it's worth buying.  It really protects my Q from scratches	1
B000KV3920:motorola_razr_blue_rubberized_crystal_case_cover:m._weitzel_"spanky"	This is a very nice sleek cover and gives your phone a great feel and look	1
B000JUQ3XY:oem_swivel_case_for_blackberry_pearl:j._wald_"pearl_lover"	I love my Blackberry Pearl and my swivel case is the icing on the proverbial cake.  Good quality swivel mechanism that appears to have the potential to last a long time, something that prior holsters have failed to do. I also like the magnetic closure, which snaps closed securely and quickly once I place my Pearl into the case, without the need for finding a snap fitting.  My older Blackberries have had cases which, after use, had their entries obstructed by flaps that fold over causing me to use the "two-handed" method for nesting my phone, one hand to move the flap out of the way, and the other to insert the phone into the case.  This is a very frustrating occurence since I am usually attempting the more-preferred "one-handed" approach. Although still relatively new, my new case appears to have no such appendage which might at a later date become worn and tired thereby causing an obstruction.	1
B000GGOD42:motorola_q_extended_battery:matthew_f._grabek_"matthew_grabek"	The battery Was ship within a day or 2 and i received it in new conditon and is working perfectly. WIll do business again. The Battery Make's the Phone Last 2 days even with continued use	1
B000KPY83K:best_smart_phone_on_the_planet!!!:network_user	I have tried 4-5 of theses phones over the last 4 years.  This one works the best of all I have tried.  The latest was the Cingular 8525 (HTC makes it) and it dropped 80% of incoming calls on pickup and 20% of outgoing calls. I thinks Windows was loading a DLL - (;&lt;))) The Palm OS is much quicker to respond to input than the Windows based SPs	1
B000KPY83K:a_great_treo:jessica_warkentin	I've had my Treo for a month and heavily use it for many applications, I especially love having the Goodlink email application, my family videos, mp3's, pics, and all my office documents at a touch of a finger. Yes the battery life goes quickly but I don't mind charging my treo every night.	1
B000HHIUQM:replacement__battery_for_cell_phone:j._kidd_"calypso"	Promptly received two replacement batteries for our phones, for the price of one from the original vendor. They work great! They hold a charge, with normal use, for about two-three days, as did our original ones when we first purchased them. Would buy again, if needed	1
B000KEP1RI:rating_phone_and_buying_experience_at_amazon:m._zafar_"mzafar"	Treo 750, one of the best and coolest phone. I am in love with this phone. Because of Windows OS, it is very easy to use and understand functions. Slim and light weight. Love the touch screen function.	1
B000AML36I:secondhand_review_of_this_phone:n._frangie_"noussa78"	my husband uses this phone for work and it has one of the funniest ringtones i've ever heard. i don't know what it's called but it has an upbeat techno rhythm to it. the walkie talkie feature is very useful as everyone in his business network uses it all the time, including him. it's great for a business that has many locations. i only give this product four stars because i haven't tried it myself so i don't know all the features. but i hope the review i've provided helps	1
B000G00WYS:you_need_this:kristin	I tripped and basically THREW my Treo about 15 feet onto the sidewalk.  With the skin on it, no harm done.  None.  This is the second skin I've owned - the first from JAVOSkin - and I like this one better than the first.  The skin is thicker but the covered buttons are better defined and easier to use.  I didn't like the cord attaching bump on the side at first - but I did attach the cord and now it is easier for me to find in my handbag.  I highly recommend this product - whether or not you use the cord	1
B000ER8MT0:works_great!:criminal_defense	This is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt. My husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks. I would give it 5 starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls	1
2756	This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2	0
5093	Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc.	0
7060	Pros:	0
10173	If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there	0
10640	This game is a joke. It is the same exact game as the 2005 version with minimal additions. The online play is so glitchy and drops so often its not even worth the time. Do not go out and buy this game thinking that its better because of all the hype. If you want to play a great football game go get NFL 2K5 by 2KSports/Sega Sports. This game is 3 years old and blows Madden away any day of the week. In 2k5 you are able to go to roster manager and change your rosters to make them current. You can edit players and create rookies like Reggie Bush or Jerious Norwood and make the roster the same as the current 2007 NFL lineups. Madden bought the rights to be the only official Nfl game for the sole reason that Madden sucks and he wants to make all the money and not spend any money improving his game. Madden bought the rights to the Nfl trademak through 2010 so no other companies could make an official Nfl game and thats why there is no 2k7 or any other game football game for it to compete with. Thats why Blitz is the only other game and they cannot use Nfl players so they have to have a generic game without real players. I hate Madden with a passion. 2K Sports is the way to go for any sports game including football you just have to do some manual labor updating rosters but once you have it is current and still 10x better than Madden will ever be. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
23121	I really wanted to like this game.. unfortunately for me, it blows. I'd trade it for a migraine if I could. The gameplay is pretty horrible, the sword scenes are reminiscent of PC adventure games circa 1992, where you press the "Attack" key and  swing your sword aimlessly at the bad-guy. The run & gun part of the game is nothing to write home about either. It feels like being teleported into the body of a cracked-out, 1 legged, drunken monkey.	0
35292	"Hey kids, fire up the XBOX and lets watch this movie!"	0
46975	I haven't even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my PS2. After the PS2 logo comes up, the screen goes blank and nothing happens. I thought it was maybe just that disc, but I exchanged it and the same thing happened. I called Ubisoft and they said many people with the Slim PS2 have called to say it doesn't work, but they don't have any answers. Sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs, and it may not work in many PS2's. Do not buy if you don't want the risk of it not working!!!!	0
58675	I gave it one star because there was no way to give it less.	0
63114	Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.	0
70332	This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short	0
83528	People, I don't know what you see in this game.  It's not really a bad game, it's just an average arcade shooter.  More often than not, I can't even hit the enemy because the action occurs so quickly.  I pop out from behind something and I'm dead meat.  Pick up the second one to see what it was like to play a good Time Crisis game	0
90264	1 star for looking at the game cover in the store, 2 stars for the visual and audio and playinggggg.-Walk, pick up specified items, push things, use a few gadgets.-Those save points that are maddening rather than save as you go.-Things to do over for the another character.-Same collection of villans over and over.-The cut scenes are sketched for you and the narration is on and on.-(why do the houses look so similar.)-Stuff in the houses that you can not touch. boring.-Find Things you need but can not use yet and have to go back for it.-Not so puzzle solve as much as fetch this and that.-No free range chicken, doors are often locked.-Had to catch same snakes more than 3 times (weeee)-Atleast if you fail a task you get to try again. -REMEMBER nothing goes well, from the get go.-I found no cheats online for this game as of yet... -Dont play the piano, you hit buttons when they float by on screen.-The kids are cute and each special gadget and moves such as they are.I have Never read these books but there is a Warning at the start of the game that this is depressing and states nothing comes out right for these kids.If you want to try this game rent it.If you want to buy this game for someone......make sure you dont mind making yourself depressed for spending the cash and them for playing it.. Do you play the game or does it play you? :-	0
96351	This game is horrible. I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it. I had wasted 5 bucks. Its patheticic. You cant do anything, graphics are horrble, cutscenes are as long as some commercials, and the characters are gay.	0
113899	I can't believe how many people are saying how "realistic" this game is.  That can not be further from the truth.  All the CPU does is lob the ball down field on 3rd and long plays and the receiver catches it 80% of the time regardless of coverage.  What fun is that?  This in itself is highly unrealistic.  Don't even get me started on the other things this game does. NCAA 2006 is nothing but an arcade game, realism is thrown out the window in this one.  EA does not know the meaning of AI.  The only difference between the levels is the amount of cheating the CPU does.	0
122227	First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.	0
143385	I was so excited to see this game come out- I loved the Godfather, and From Russia with Love, and the hype surrounding this game was incredible.  The actual game, however, was incredibly disappointing.  The driving controls, especially compared to the driving controls in The Godfather, are AWFUL.  I was having so much trouble driving I kept looking through the handbook to see if I was doing something wrong, but from what I saw I was using the controller the way I was supposed to.  Most of the missions involve driving, under a specific time limit, and with these awful controls, I gave up early- way too frustrating.  The musical play list that you get to control was fun, but I would have liked more free-roaming like in the Godfather.  I was also looking forward to hearing everyone's voices that were in the opening credits- Dale Earnhardt Jr???  But since I have almost totally given up on it now, I guess I won't get to hear their voice acting talent.  Does anyone know if they plan to re-release this on the xbox 360?  Maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then.  This game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to	0
147957	This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least.  I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk.  Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost  as much as this glamour life stuff pack did.  This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy	0

159251	this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release	0

176164	lucas should be ashamed to stamp his name on this turkey. do not play on the xbox 360. you will experience random sound shreiks, resolution issues, too-lonng load times. and overall this is a really buggy and perplexing product. why? the first was very good	0
179128	On paper, the idea of a 24 video game sounds like a great idea, and upon first glance of it, it seems like it's firing on all cylinders.  Featuring all the major players from the series reprising their roles (Kiefer Sutherland, Dennis Haysbert, Elisa Cuthbert, etc.) and a storyline and tone and atmosphere that captures the feel of the show, 24: The Game falls apart once you get further into it.  The missions are repetitive, the animation and graphics are jumpy and glitched, and the controls are unresponsive to say the least.  Targeting enemies is a chore at times as you use the analog sticks, but the targeting along with just plain moving gets incredibly cumbersome thanks to a camera that seems to want to work against you.  Some of this could be forgiveable, but the further you get through 24 the more rushed the game feels.  It's a shame too, considering how innovative the series was in it's early life and everything the game had going for it.  If more polish was put into it, 24: The Game could have been something special, but as it is, it's only recommended as a rental for fans of the series	0
184878	The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game.  My daughter has played them all.  However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds.  Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all.  All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery.  However, this game took her two days.  All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more.  This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed.  In fact, her words at the end of the game were, "that's it?".  Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest	0
184886	Both this game and Danger by Design were disappointing compared to some of the previous games (Shadow Ranch, the Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon, Secret of the Old Clock, etc.).  The game was short, and I thought the tasks were a bit dull.  I also found it somewhat confusing switching between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  Hopefully Her Interactive will produce something better next time, because these games really are addictive, even for adults	0

206021	We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free	0
207772	I loved this game as a child and I spent many hours playing it. I was incredibly excited to be able to play it on my Laptop. OOPS they didn;t update any of the drivers for the first two games (Kings Quest 1 & 2) so after about 15 minutes of playing you can't see the screen due to all of the graphic errors. There are no patches available as of yet and it dosn't look like any are on the way. I feel pretty ripped off. It says on the cover in big print. "Runs on Windows XP." Barely, and not very well when it does. If you are interested in this game check to see if Vivendi has done any patches before you buy it or you will be disapointed. Better yet download one of the fan-made editions for free online. They work	0
211654	It has pretty much all been said, let's just say it again 'cause I'm sure Firaxis/Firefly will plant positive reviews here. The game takes ages to load, the voice acting is silly (British? Australian? Herman's Hermits?), the progression is totally linear (ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels), the graphics date to 2002, and the citizen 'fetching' system is completely random and opaque. Sit and watch for awhile: your huts will change size every thirty seconds.	0

222352	Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion.	0

239356	I actually recieved this from a friend of mine, which he bought for $0.98. Anyway, I said that there were television shows that I thought were interesting, but were only sold over in the UK (and so on). He told me that the AR MAX was a REGION X DVD reader. So, I took it home, and decided on buying a TV series that was a Region 2, and just recieved it today, to my surprise (not actually) the damn thing didn't work. Now I'm stuck with a Region 2 DVD with nothing to play it in. I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT! If you are buying this for the reason that it reads other Regions of DVD's...DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is junk. However, I am thankful that I didn't even buy this product, but it was given to me. I hope that someone planning on buying this, reads my review first. IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY	0

245422	Stay away from this product, my intercooler, while noisy as all hell worked for a good 3 months, but i continously got random red-circles-of-death until my 360 got another one today and couldnt recover. This product will mess up your 360 because of the way the power cord has to go through it first.	0
245798	My son begged for this game, and the price is reasonable compared to some games so we added it to our collection.  He enjoyed levels 1 & 2, but once we got to level 3 that was it!  Unless you have earned the nickname "Fast fingers" or "Fury Feet" don't bother purchasing this until you rent it.  I spent an hour trying to beat level 3 for my 6 year old the only thing I discovered was that I did equally as well when I randomly hit the 4 keys as quickly as possible (about 57% accurate) as I did actually keeping up.  Being this is only level 3 I can only imagine the "Dance Levels" get harder from here, Good Luck!!	0

264936	Dont get me wrong the controller is inovative and feels good and is really a grea idea but the one huge problem that noone has mentioned is how these things eat up batteries, put it this way, you need to put new AA batteries in the damn thing every three days, and that is not cool at all! I will be buying the wire controlers from now on,	0
277340	i am a huge spyro fan, i have been playing since the first one, which was great, the second one better, the third one, ok, forth one What happened!! this one, after purchasing mine from amazon cheaply for something like 5 i regret doing so, it was a waste of money seen as the whole game is a bit repetative and frustrating, you never seem to get anywhere. all the voices have changed. if you are a series gamer and enjoyed the origional spyro games, dont buy this and dont be disapointed. however i would say that if you are under 12 you would probably very much enjoy the game	0
289380	I started with Caesar2 back when it came out. I played it for hours and hours and loved it. When Caesar3 came out I bought that too and loved it even more and spent even more time playing. Both Caesar2 and 3 rarely crashed. Things have changed!	0

297056	This so called game has a very good story and plot. It keeps your attention, by making you want to see what happens next. However, the gameplay could not satisfy an 8 year old. Why you ask? Because there is none. You watch 15 minutes of cinematics and then are pretty much told what you have to do. There is really not much thought needed since you are pretty much led directly to where you have to be or the object you need. Oooooh. there are multple endings. Whoopee! You still have to sit through a majority of the same cinematics and virtually do nothing. Out of the 5 or 6 hours spent playing this game through the first time, I would estimate that I only needed the controller in my hand for 30 minutes. This makes for a good movie but don't buy it if you actually like to PLAY your games instead of watch them	0
302297	My friends and I had high hopes for this game.  We played COD2 multiplayer every week and were excited about a new shooter.  After playing COD3 for a few rounds we  decided to put 2 back in.  The graphics are great, but we found a lot of bugs.  There were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance.  That's fine if you want to be a UN soldier, but not if you're trying to sneak up on somebody.  Muzzle flashes were almost none existent.  No blood splash like in COD2.  The single player game isn't too bad so far, but if you plan on multiplayer I would recommend renting it first.  We were of the opinion that the game was rushed, maybe they'll patch it	0
309638	I bought the game couple of weeks ago. I was hesitating on buying it initially, but finally I did because of all the good hype about the game. I wish I didn't buy it.	0
315714	I'll cut to the chase on this one. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy VII, you will look over the shortcomings of this game and find some enjoyment out of it. It has a good story and characters. Its fun to see some of your favorite characters from VII return. But if your not a FF fan, then you won't have much motivation to play this game, and I'm not sure why you would like it. Its very average to mediocre as a action game. Its not horrible by any means, but its just not very good either.	0
325457	No way to change the inputs on your TV.	0
351977	Before I was even done with Final Fantasy VII, I ordered this game. I loved that game, and thought 'Say, if Final Fantasy VII is this good, then VIII must be even better!', boy was I wrong! I'm not bashing Final Fantasy VIII, I kind of liked the game, but there are big problems with it. First of all, the draw system is kind of hard, but I liked it, it was a change of pace, but the way you have to equip summon GFs (Guardian Force) was hard and boring. The music in the game reminds me of the music in the movie 'AKIRA', which is a bad thing, The characters in battle remind me of crash dummies, and the way that you get new weapons is by making them at junk shops! Not only that, but the characters are not very likeable.	0

388411	I had high hopes on this game but I was disapointed. The controls are horrible and definately the voice acting throughout 90% was bad. The story line was basically typical, it really didn't hold my interest for long. I did beat the game because I spent $50 on it the day it came out and I figured I would at least do that. I gave the game to a friend of mine after I beat it and he had the same opinion as I did. It's worth renting but definately not worth buying. Hopefully those who decide to buy or rent this game can devote a good bit of time trying to learn the controls	0
391685	This game has a great design and excellent/fun story BUT it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the PC. Whenever there are more than about 5 enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping/graphic slowdown issues. This means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn't respond quickly to the commands. The clipping is so bad that sometimes I just wanted to find the CEO of Activision and shove this game down his throat. This CAN be a fun game, just don't play the PC version. Borrow someone's Xbox and play that version. This is another example of a greedy developer rushing a PC port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right	0
413471	I rented this game and returned it the next day because between my and my friend we could not get past the dancing scene we tried for like an hour and couldn't get past it don't waste your time or patience with this annoying game	0
417064	First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.	0
423313	I used my remote all of about 8 times before it stopped working.  Even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller, you must use the remote control.  When you take the dongle out with a DVD in, a screen will come up telling to reinsert, so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction, then you've just wasted thirty bucks.  I feel quite ripped off.  With the low cost of DVDs nowadays, it's a MUCH better idea to buy a standalone IMHO, you can get a good progressive scan for about $30 or $40, which comes out to about the same price.	0

462073	After all the Hype about this game I bought it...well in my opinion it just felt flat on its face. The game simply is not very intersting and the storyline can be plain boring. There are other RPGs out there that are better and you simply get immersed in the story line quickly. The battles get boring extremely quickly since all you do is kinda point and tap the same guys over and over. The "costumes" and "decals" are kinda stupid. Many said this was the next EARTHBOUND, well is NOT and not even close. The Nintendo DS has so much potential and this game does not deliver in graphics, sound , game play and fun. dont get me wrong the game is not horrible by any means but defitnetly not that good either. check out some reviews out there before you buy it	0
465362	When Disney Interactive released &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,&quot; in early 2000, they anticipated a very warm response to the disc, which had a firm but low opening price. However, when actually being played, the game is sure to depress. If it isn't crudely simple, the design is poor and uninspired. The entire game is essentially based on one lackluster thing: Regis Philbin repeating the same phrases over and over again. &quot;Be Sure to come back to... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&quot; &quot;I hope you'll join me again on... Who Wants to be a Millionaire.&quot; If one doesn't decide to resell (or simply trash) this game within its first week of purchase, they work for Disney Interactive or are Regis themselves. Don't waste your time on this pitiful effort	0
467197	The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.	0

474552	This was the first Wii game I got, and its mostly because I couldn't get a hold of Zelda.  Red Steel looks promising.  Certainly its controls are good, but it feels more like a game that's supposed to get you used to using the remote and nunchuck attachment.  A tutorial of sorts.  The problem is that it isn't much fun to deal with.	0

484295	Please promise me you will never play this.  It is not worth your time.  If you paid money for it, try to find the person you gave that money to and kick them in the shin.  Hard.  Then throw your copy of this game in the dumpster.	0
498220	I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all.  Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process.  Aspyr support is unable to help.	0
503894	There is nothing majorly wrong with this game.  The plot is well-developed, the characters are customizable, and the battles are strategic.  This is probably primarily subjective, but I just didn't enjoy this game.  It's not because there were too many movies--it's because I didn't like the movie.  I also didn't like the characters or the villains or for that matter the aesthetics.  There were some minor but annoying flaws in the game which further contributed to my displeasure.  Which button to press was often counterintuitive, and so I often found myself pressing the wrong button.  Also, the game badly needs a journal and/or a destination guide so you know where to go--I once spent one hour doing nothing other than walking around a space ship trying to figure out where to go	0
508052	This game sucks.  It tries to be Sim City with extra features.  Unfortunately, the graphics are way below average.  In fact, some of the screens look like they were designed by a first year art student.  The Interface is clumsy and not intuitive.  I am a big fan of the Sim City series and this game really falls short	0

515351	As far as I am concerned this game is total garbage and I would not recomend it to any one. I do not know why it was ever released..!! Deer hunter 2003 is the same way I tossed both of them in the garbage. Trophy hunter 2003 is a much different story. The game play is very good and the graphics are up to par with todays fast computers..	0
518560	This is the worst item you can get for your 360. I got one and started experiencing many problems with my 360. It was crashing and freezing and ultimately I had to get my console repaired. Do not get this unless you want to hurt your baby (360)	0

535663	This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't	0
536595	I have always been a fan of fighting games.  As far as 3D ones go, I have great experience in the Dead or Alive series and proficiency with Soul Calibur 2.  I fear that Dead or Alive and Soul Calibur may have spoiled me though.  Recently I bought Mortal Kombat Deception and found it horribly awkward* compared to the fluid battles of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive.  I felt the same way when I played Tekken 5.  Unlike the graceful and awesome animations of Dead or Alive or Soul Calibur, the movements of the characters in Tekken 5 are unrealistic and absurd.  Try out Christie in Tekken 5 for example.  Her idle animation is preposterous.  If you have access to Dead or Alive 3, try putting out Leifang.  Her idle animation is a thing of beauty.  Every one of her moves flows perfectly from one to the next.  This kind of grace is seriously lacking in the clunky Tekken 5.	0
537158	I was really excited when I saw this item was out!  I had the Commodore 64 when I was a kid, and my brother and I used to spend hours and hours playing games on it.  I was so glad to see that Winter Games and Summer Games was included.... until the item arrived and I plugged it in and tried to play with it.. the joystick doesn't work at ALL when you move it to the right.  So, you can only use it to go up down or left.	0
542876	I dont have much to say other than I did not like this game.  I was hoping that it was going to be like Fusion Frenzy for the Xbox but it was not nearly as fun.  The controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good.  Some people may like it but I didn't	0
553746	This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that i've heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model.

565365	I bought this because the two Dino Crisis games on the Playstation 1 were fantastic survival horror fun, and I was very taken with the hype around this game which billed it as a lightgun game that was free roaming rather than on rails. What they didn't say was that it's almost impossible to use the PS2 gun as a fully functioning controller, which is what you really need to do. For anything but shooting, all the buttons you need are in really inconvenient places all around the gun and after half an hour's play time, I had to take a break to rest my aching joints.	0
567666	Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone	0
576704	This game was a really big disappointment for me.  I had to try this game because of all the hype and all the reviews here.  Having played the Nintendo 64 game titled Mario Kart 64 I felt like it was not much of an improvement.  In fact, I feel that Mario Kart 64 was a better game.  The only improvement was in the graphics.  Still, why do the characters not have fingers?  In this stage of the game you would think that they would have fingers by now.  Anyway, after I played the game I played a bit cheated.  I was bored by it within ten minutes.  The game is supposed to shine with multiplayer but it fizzled.  There are so many GameCube racing games out there that are so much better than this game at a much lower price.  One example of a better combat racing game is Burnout.  If you can get any one of the games in this series you will see what a good combat racing game feels like.  I feel that Mario Kart Double Dash!! is a dumbed down version of Mario Kart 64.  I so much wanted it to be a great game.  It no longer has the hopping ability of the previous game.  For me it just wasn't very good.  Double Dash!! probably would be better for very young gamers as they would probably be more forgiving of its shortcomings	0

603851	This game is horrible. I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it. I had wasted 5 bucks. Its patheticic. You cant do anything, graphics are horrble, cutscenes are as long as some commercials, and the characters are gay.	0
741	The gameplay and overall feel of this game screams Castlevania. The sidescrolling platform action is spot on, the graphics truly push the limits of the DS, and the variety of equipment/soul combinations will lend itself perfectly to creating a gameplay experience perfect for your style of play.	1
1672	I am so glad I purchased the Logitech Mic for PS2.  The quality of the sound is awesome, and my kids are having a blast with it.  The price is reasonable.  My kids take very good care of things, but I'm not so sure that it could withstand any mistreatment.  I will probably end up buying another one	1
2999	Halo blew everyone away when it came out because no one was expecting it and it was one of the beat looking games of its time.	1
7054	One of the most common complaints is that Xenosaga Ep. II's battle system is annoying and ponderous because "even in 'regular' battles, it forces you to spend many turns Stocking just so that you can do decent damage to enemies." This is actually a form of codespeak. What these people are really saying is "I'm not very bright, and even after several hours of playing Ep. II, I somehow never realized how to use the battle system efficiently."	1
10174	Used this product to softmod my xbox. Had to download an older version of the software though. If you just use it to cheat in games..probably not worth the money.	1
10639	I have to start off by saying if you own the 06 version, then dont bother updating, as you may not notice many of the updates/upgrades.	1
12421	i love this game because it is about a beautiful little princesse and a boy with a tail who loves the princesse i have played this game over and over and still play it more.i don't think i will ever get tired of it. it is so much fun.	1
13741	If you liked the first Disgaea you will just love the second one!  The game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game.  Now instead of taking FOREVER to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer, ninja, etc. much quicker.  The main characters are still hilarious, and I love the fact that you get to see Laharl, Etna and the gang again in this one.  (Go Prism Rangers =/).	1
15305	I have had three of these Logitech Wireless controllers now.  They have all broken nearly seven months to the day I buy them.	1
17883	At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.	1
22307	In case you havent' noticed this is a controller not a game. So as far as the controller goes, it works great and I have not had a single problem with it.	1
39073	The GTA series has created a new thresshold in video games. With creation of GTA 3, games became increasingly more violent and more controversal. San Andreas is no exception.	1
43462	This is a great cable for your HD TV while playing you Sony Playstation 2. It give very crisp and clear images, much better than the cable that comes with the playstation.	1
44381	This game is really good.Theres a wide varity of lvls to play,and a very good multyplayer system.The game only has a few faults, like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship.The game also gets a little boring after a while.Besides that,its a great game	1
44600	This was the first karaoke revolution game that I received, and I enjoy it very much! However, the songs on the game I found were quite old, even for someone like myself, a senior in college. I dont know about the rest of you, but the 80's were a blur for me. I didnt know these songs very well, which can put a major hinderance on game play. I liked the high amount of songs they put on he recent game, but I have already ordered Karaoke Revolution Volume 3 after seeing more recent songs that I would know.	1
45750	Okami rates among the most beautiful games I've ever seen.	1
46255	The best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city.  Fight the gangs and police, attack the citizens and steal cars!!  If you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the Internet, then this is where the fun really begins! These secrets can give you armor, weapons and even a tank (this is only listing a few)!  As always parents, research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old.	1
49156	You can go wrong, very good equiment, lots of fun easy to carry, the console with most games plus has a great pric	1
52053	Karaoke Revolution Party is a fantastic game with great songs, great easy gameplay and perfect party game features. If you've never tried a karaoke game, now's the time to play.	1
55470	I had purchased this two pack memory card and they are pretty good no problems with memory card	1
55892	Ico was a game that was very different from others. It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio. Imagine what Ico would be if action were incorporated into it, you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico's prequel. SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels.	1
59265	I do not own the headset yet, but I have already ordered it from amazon, and It is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit, so I will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes. My impression is that it will be a very good product, because it is logitech, and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make, and it is fablous. The price? Great price. I got mine for somthing like $25. (buy from abuy4u)but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset. Yes, 6 hours can last me a weekend.	1
59502	The Grand Theft Auto series and the PlayStation 2 have gone hand in hand, which each game debuting on the PS2 before it travels to other consoles. That all changed with the release of last year's side story, Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. This game, designed to take advantage of the PSP's hardware, was an impressive technical feat, managing to pack in a lot of what made the "big" GTA games so memorable. But it fell short in a few key spots, most notably the story, the characters, and the series' biting sense of style and satire. That stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry Liberty City around in your back pocket. But on the PS2, where you can compare it directly to the three Grand Theft Auto games that have appeared there, the whole package is significantly less interesting, even considering the PS2 port's budget price.	1
61888	In truth, there really hasn't been a great Mana game since Secret of Mana back in 1993.  Every Mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings, and Children of Mana is no different.  Why did I buy it knowing this?  For the same reason many Mana fans continue to invest in Mana games.  There's always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that Secret of Mana did.  Unfortunately, Children of Mana does not do this.  It doesn't rekindle the magic Secret of Mana gave us, but that shouldn't suggest it falls short of it either.	1
67589	first off, let me say for the most part, katamari damacy is an amazing game.  if you don't know the story behind it, well, it wasn't thought up by game designers and that's why it's so original.  the game ideas came from a lady who didn't even like video games, and they used her ideas to make it.  in a world where if you've played one RPG, you've played them all, if you've played one shooter you've played them all, etc. katamari damacy is a HUGE breath of fresh air, and i'm glad it's popular.  the music is strangely catchy, it has a great sense of humor, the attention to detail is absolutely astounding (a ton of work must have went into this game), and it's surprisingly very addictive and fun.  in fact, unless you've actually played this game, you won't understand how fun and addictive it is.  show me many games and i can say "i'd like that" or "i wouldn't like that," but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand.  and there's even a 2 player mode where you can compete against a friend!	1
72610	I bought this game as a xmas gift for my 6 and 10 year old boys. They play this game NON-STOP, basically until they're completely worn out. The game is a perfect way for kids to get exercise in the long winter months! If your kids have a PS2, then this game is a must have!!	1
73289	This was a well put-together game that was lots of fun to play.  You'll want to play it again as soon as you finish it.  I'm not a big Star Wars fan but I was nuts for this game.	1
81041	I loved this game so much I have gone and got a second copy, mine has stopped working!	1
83535	Time crises is a 5 star gam	1
85201	I'll admit I was a little skeptical about this game. As it turns out, this game rocks! Arena Football fans do not pass this one up! Hopefully when  they make the sequel(yeah, I said SEQUEL)they will include the new AFL2  teams. Tennessee Valley Vipers rule	1
87934	Just to add my 2 cents to an already glowingly-reviewed title, a couple more clues as to how well-received this game was:	1
89329	I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter. I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much. I won't buy the 07 when it comes out, I'll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3	1
90598	I love this game.  I haven't played other DDR games before, so I'm not sure how it compares to others, but this one is great.  Some of the songs I like a lot, and some I don't, but they're all a challenge and fun in some way.  I like to use the Dance Master mode in which you have to unlock songs by doing well.  I haven't made it all that far because I play the same levels over and over again because they're so fun.  This game is great for people of all ages, and includes music for the young and old.	1
95347	In late 04 I decided to give in and purchase THE gaming system at the time that was the original Xbox.  Having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on (and never owned) systems I had little knowledge of how it'd be upon use--but since Halo 2 had just been released to rave reviews I knew I had to try it out (hey, it's HALO, people!).  Man, I was glad I invested in it!  It's a bit large (compared to my best friend's PS2) and is a bit difficult to lug someplace, but the graphics are much better than the PS2 and the games available for it are great (significantly the critically acclaimed Halo series, of course, THE best game out there in my opinion).  There are some issues with how bulky the system is but it's about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is	1
102788	I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.	1
107048	Neat game but I shouldn't have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level 20.  The 'leveling system' developer should have stayed off the crack pipe.	1
110410	I've had my 360 since day one, and it's been worth every dollar.  Let me start by saying there is NOTHING, nothing that compares to Xbox Live on the 360.  Microsoft knows online gaming, they know the gamer.  By the end of the month you will be able to download High Def Movies for rent, and tv shows for free.  The online community is set up to help guide you to gamers like yourself, and people with your skill level.  Sony can't do this, and Ninendo can't do this.  They will try, but the Xbox has been doing this for years now starting with the original xbox.	1
111436	I really enjoy top down and side scrolling shooters, so take this opinion with that in mind.  The only problem with R-Type is that dying sucks.  When you die you restart from a usually bad position without any powerups.  Once you unlock free-play this can make the game frustrating when you are playing new stages or playing with a different ship etc.  However overall I think it's the best of the R-types and one of the better side scrollers out there.	1
114152	I purchased this game for my son and he loves it.  He plays for hours and really enjoys racing the cars.  I'm glad that we selected this game for him, he also has Underground - Hot Pursuit and he enjoys that one also	1
115273	Why mess with the original.  There are a lot of phonies and copycat controllers that you can get for a discount.  You get what you pay for.  I have several of the standard ones like this and they are quality.  In addition the controls for the Gamecube are similar enough to other Nintendo products so you won't have to learn a completely new system	1
117552	its simple, you can use your controler to do most of the fuctions this remote can do but, it takes a lot more time. Same differance with highspeed and dialup. If you have dont mind taking a little longer to get things done then use the controler. personally, I like my 360 remote	1
121735	When I heard that Square was going to remake Final Fantasy IV (originally Final Fantasy II in the U.S.) I was very excited. This game is considered to be one of the greatest Final Fantasy games of all time. All in all I would recomend this game to anyone who is a Final Fantasy fan	1
123404	This game looks like so much fun! I mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to play as Shamu and swim around and stuff? I am very disappointed in the lack of screenshots and videos, I really think this game has potential. I've been a huge fan of Shamu ever since I was a little kid. Every summer when me and my family go to San Diego on vacation we always go and see him. I have at least ten Shamu stuffed animals on my bed. Anyways, I'm really looking forward to this game. Think about it, how many games allow you to go underwater and swim around as a creature that's home is the deep blue sea? None. With this game, I won't have to get my stuffed animals all wet when I take them in my bath with me and play around. Now if I want to pretend to be Shamu all I have to do is turn on my Gamecube! Ya see, if this game is advertised correctly it will definitely be one of the best games of the year. We need to spread the work about this	1
137695	Microsoft has created an extraordinary machine. Crisp graphics and so far the library of games available are impressive. The only problem I have is that Microsoft produced a defective product. For the first few months it played fine with only aa couple of moments where the games would freeze. No biggie. Then it died. No problem, sent it in for repairs under warranty. Free of charge. Cool. Got it back and it played well with me actually beating Ghost Recon with no problems. I stopped playing for a while but when I tried playing again BAM! Ring of Death. Warranty over. $130-140 dollars to fix. Yay. I think I'm going to throw it against the wall and buy a new one. Hopefully Microsoft has found all the solutions to the defects.	1
138899	This game is mysteriously hilarious and always fun to play. You don't exactly "finish" it, like other video games, but are always trying to beat your fastest time, so it doesn't get old as fast. As a matter of fact, we wore out our last copy and this is our second.	1
140433	While I did not have to spend retail on this headset(I got it along with an Xbox and several other things on Ebay), I did have to buy the communicator(which can be found on gamestop.com) and it was still worth the money.  It blocks out background noises so that the people you are talking to wont hear other people in the household talking or guests that you have with you talking to you.  While it is not worth $50, if you can get it as part of a deal with something else, by all means do it.	1
141746	A brilliant remake of the original classic! Although I am an avid fan of the first DOOM...I strongly urge you to NOT juxtapose the two. If you sit back and pick apart the differences between them, you'll never enjoy DOOM 3.	1
143392	This game is truly worth the wait.  It really makes you feel like you are creating a drug empire and it is incredibly addicting.  The gameplay is awesome the shooting mechanics work great much better than any of the GTA games. This is one of the funnest games to shoot people in and the chainsaw is really awesome.  This probally the funnest open world game i have ever played to drive in.  The cars handle great and are a blast to drive.  The graphics look great and the particle effects are truly awesome.  This is a must get game	1
151963	this game is good cheap now buy if you didnt before and if you cant afford gun for 49.99 buy this game cause they copied it	1
152526	When I first played this game I was shocked. Just of how good a stealth game could actually be. Its realistic in its ways that you can hide in the shadows and use the enviroment to take out your enemies. Its really fun also, suspense is one of the main things that happens in this game. You only use two guns during the whole game, the pistol and the rifle that has attachments. Good stuff. All you need is that, and you can take out a whole building full of enemies. You have to crouch, and move slowly so the enemy doesnt see you. A very realistic game and im happy that this series of games got released. I highly recommend this game. Great storyline, and the last level is hecka hard!	1
153990	Expensive but worth it - it just works.  No more wires	1
157958	What else needs to be said. Even with a low-end Graphics card this Masterpiece is FUN! Perfect combination for a laptop/notebook. Too bad Sir William Gates won't allow a PC version of Halo 2. Well anyways seeya in Halo 3 Deathmatc	1
159172	I decided to buy STAR WARS REPUBLIC COMMANDO on Xbox for my son, because he won't let me play my PC version.  Come to find out it seems like it plays easier on Xbox.	1
159253	From the commercials, Max Payne was a third-person shooter with a twist; the twist being able to kill mobsters, junkies and mercenaries in slow motion. Truly, one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you.	1
165608	This game remains one of my favorite games of all time.	1
170104	the wavebird can really take a beating. there are 2 dogs in my house that drool all over them and two infants that pick them up and throw them and they still work fine. plus the game that ip[lay all the time is Super Smash Bros. Melee and the controller is still fine after all the button mashing. I also have a wireless xbox controller and there is one feature that reely helps that i wish was on the wavebird. After 10 min of no use my xbox controller automatically shuts its self off which saves the battery. its too bad the wavebird doesnt have this. but overall its a great controlle	1
170931	...which is ok.  I think if they made this game fully controlled by the stylus and touchpad it would make it a bit wacky. Sort of like Mario 64 DS.  And like Mario Kart, you have the 2nd screen as your map.  But you can also use it to use items whenever you like and also jump from area to area whenever you want.	1
176165	Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG's. It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game. I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	1
178520	As always, the Nancy Drew games do not disappoint.  Personally, I quite enjoyed driving around delivering telegrams, if for no other reason than to keep my cash flow going, and to tour the rest of the town.  I must admit, I was a bit confused as to why HerInteractive wouldn't have incorporated the Courthouse into the game for some purpose, but hey, it's nice to see they have a penchant for detail.  After all, what town doesn't have a Courthouse? heh.	1
179135	Like 90% of the people who played this game, my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of 24. The story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the 2nd and 3rd seasons of the show.	1
182659	Purchase the xbox console and dvd movie playback kit that matches the region in which you are located.After you buy the dvd kit and put the dvd infrared sensor into your xbox,the dvd kit permanently codes your xbox based on the region that your kit is from(the region code of the dvd kit is  only written on the outside packaging of the kit).From that point forward,you can only play dvd's from the region that the xbox dvd kit is from and,ofcourse,dvd's carrying the label 'all regions'.You cannot play dvd's from another region even if you later on try using a dvd kit from that other region on your xbox.For instance,if you are in the US and have a region 1 dvd kit and you import a dvd from abroad,say, having region code 3,it will not play on your xbox console.But here's how you can change the dvd region on your xbox to play it.1-Send your xbox console for a repair to have it re-adjusted to play dvd's from the desired region.You will have to pay for a repair here even if your xbox is still in warranty period.2-Next,buy a dvd kit sold for the desired region to use after your xbox console is repaired.From here on in,you can only play dvd's from this region and ,ofcourse,dvd's carrying the label 'all regions'.It is is a permanent change.	1
184954	The introduction ISN'T boring, it ISN'T long, and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix/SE.  If you don't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111!!!1, then don't buy another RPG for as long as you live.  RPGs are supposed to have stories, and this one is no different.  If you don't like it, take it back and get a refund... don't play RPG's like this if you can't stand words.  Go play some GTA or something--- oh wait, theres words in that too	1
193587	One of the main reasons that I decided to become a GameCube owner was due to its ability to play GBA, GBC, and GB games on an external source, a television, a projector, a 5" universal screen, etc. I could care less about its inability to play DVDs because I had already owned a PlayStation 2 for that. Then afterwards, I started using less for Game Boy titles and more for a game called Super Smash Bros Melee, which most of my former floormates used to play almost all of the time and I would just stand there and watch.	1
197289	This is the second Elder Scrolls game I've played, the first being Oblivion. I really enjoyed Oblivion and decided to give this one a try, and I must say I've really enjoyed it so far. Still on the main quest, though right now I'm gonna join the Morag Tong.	1
199242	Well what can i say this was one of da BEST Tony Hawk Video Games too date , I mean the plot is sick in its on right ,You create ur own custom skater whoo goes from bein a street skater too a national skateboardin icon , but this game switches its style and plot from The first installment of the T.H.U.G. , In this installment , your picked bye the birdman himslef too lead your team in the world destruction tour which i think is one of da illest ideas , U Gotta face up against no one other then Skateboard Bad Boy Himself "Bam Margera" who in my personal opinion I have been a big fan of Bam and his possie ever since the CKY Video Days , And now too have them as "Main Charachters" in this game is awsome , Its Like you got the normal Tony Hawk Skate Team and Then the whole "Viva La Bam" Cast Aswell , Its Just Amazing , The Story mode is the best ive seen yet in the Franchise , This game is so Addictingly Fun , I Recommend this Game "100%". Personally i think this title would of fit it so much better "Tony Hawks Underground 2 : World Destuction Tour. PS The newest installment of the Tony Hawk Franchise Just Dropped 3 Days Ago "Tony Hawks American Wasteland" And too tell you the truth i think this game is still a little bit better , maybe its just because this game had the whole Viva La Bam cast in it too give it that crazy feel, But To me this is still the undisputed Champ of thhe Tony Hawk Franchise , FOR NOW	1
203794	This isn't much like the spiderman games that i'm used to, but it is definitely a lot of fun. Good storyline for a fighting game. The single player is challenging (but beatable) and uses most if not all the characters. There are plenty of characters, and most are different and have unique powers. There are two versus modes: against the computer or against a friend. The computer is pretty easy to beat. Each character has it's own pros and cons. Another thing i like is that the character levels aren't the same (anybody remember super smash bros?). In most games there are a lot of different people but they're mostly the same and your winning mostly just rides on your experience with their moves. In this there are some major strong characters unlocked at the end.	1
206018	I dont know what everyone else's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome!  The graphics are out of this world, and its very suspenseful.  There's a murder or dead body around every corner, and you get to firgure out who did it!  The ending was the best, it took me and my brother at least 24 hours, (not all at once of course), to solve this mystery.  It's a really great buy! ~Andre	1
207349	For all you non-believers out there, BUY THIS GAME! I was like you...reading the reviews, looking at the box in various stores, pondering, considering, thinking to myself, "should I buy this game?" Now that I finally spent the mere $20 and played the game, I am wondering why I didn't do so sooner. As an avid Playstation supporter, (Stood in line for hours and paid over $600 for my PS2 back in the day), this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment. Cinematically driven storyline, supurbly coordinated character control, creative levels and character design, great soundtrack, decent bosses, pretty cool power moves, and, (importantly), puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the TV screen...except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns. In closing, all I gotta say is the same thing I said my first sentence of this review...BUY THIS GAME	1
210890	This game is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the only problem is that in order to get some achievments, you have to play it on veteran mode. Sometimes you will be near the end of a level and the checkpoint will occur right in the middle of a battle. One time I was getting shot at by a tank and it saved the game. Only three shots will kill you. I HAD TO restart the whole level and it took me another hour to complete it.	1
215271	This game is awesome. I love to play it, and i play it everyday. In school it gets me way far ahead, and much quicker too at math. The only thing that puts the game at a rate of overall 4 stars is that in one of the games you have to speak out, and sometimes it won't take your answer. this happens sometimes, but it kind of stinks because your getting tested, so when it won't take it it counts it as wrong. But i gotta say don't let this little thing stop you from buying this game. It will kill alot of time. On long trips i always take it, and whenever i get to my destination im like man i spent over two hours playing the ds? It totally rocks! i used to get car sick because i was bored, and just sitting in the car, but now i don't get car sick at all, because im doing something else. This game has made me good, and quick at math in my school. It really helped. This game is definitely good for all ages even my dad plays it!	1
218046	Graphics leave something to be desired but the story and game play make this game a must play for any RPG fan.	1
220018	I bought this game a bit late (2 years after It came out)	1
222353	I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out.  My initial thought was what was Squar thinking.  I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game.  It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people, right before KH2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the $20 to get the game, (as was the price of the game by then,) and low and behold, by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked.  I played that game for what seemed like hours on in, (it was really only a very long weekend.) But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out.  The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X, and Final Fantasy VII, my two favorit games in the world. I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination.  If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did.  It was well worth the price, and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner	1
224612	Had this game on our gamecube, so addicting then, now we have it on our DS and it is just as much fun. Only downside to it is it can be confusing as to how to unlock all the stuff.  You have to get a certain rating I believe, like A-D, nonetheless it is a great game, worth the money! If you have kids, the kids will thoroughly enjoy	1
229077	...the graphics are pretty imbarasing.	1
231908	Though I was daunted a little by the reviews stating problem with installing the game I went for it and I don't regret. I bought the Platinum Edition and it installs all right. The good thing about the platinum edition is that you get three games at the same time.	1
232421	Nintendo DS Lite (2006.)	1
237910	The price of the card is about $7-$10 cheaper than in the stores, but what is the point if you have to pay $10 shipping (Express) or about $7 (Office Depot), who are the ones that are shipping you this card and not Amazon.  This much to ship a tiny card and thin packaging is a joke.	1
239290	I had a chance to buy this game machine for my 10yr old boy with super mario. Two monitors are bright enough to play with even under the sun light and battery runs long enough at least almost all day long after they came back from school till they go to bed as  long as  you do full charge during the night.	1
241422	This collection isn't as bonus feature happy as Anthology was. this version of FF4 (2 in the USA at the time of the SNES/Genesis era) hasn't changed that much. the random battle loading screen is like the SNES version, the switch between field/world map to the character menu while loading is fast as hell (while sadly Chrono Trigger is slower than the 2 FF games for the Anthology collection and even slower than the other Final Fantasy games for the PSone Era (7,8,9)) Chrono Trigger has a lot of bonus features for this version. Squaresoft (at the time) put a S*** load of cinemas (mainly ending cinemas), has a list of music from the game, and other stuff. The gameplay is still the same, with the exception of what I said earlier, which is good otherwise. unlike Anthology, this collection has no bonus music CD (for those who care anyway). this is still worth owning anyway	1
245425	In the persuit of keeping you 360 cool it does the job quite well. But as a side affect it is quite loud which may detur someone from using it	1
245802	My friend told me it was unbelivably fun and said if u like a good laugh It`s a MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
249092	If you liked the original then you will also like KH2. It finishes the story nicely. Battle commands are improved - I especially like the Reaction commands. Still has some camera issues. Overall a good game	1
257101	This is my first experience with Sim City.  I've never played with the earlier versions.  Important Note:  The computer prompts you to type in the code that is in the white box in the lower left part of back of the CD case.  Well, I looked and looked, and it wasn't where the prompt said it would be.  After five minutes of thinking my eyes were playing tricks on me, I finally found the code.  It's on the back of the owners manual located inside the CD case.  You'll find it at the very top of that back cover of the manual, not in the lower left corner.	1
257706	With Tekken 5, the folks at Namco have crafted the best edition yet of the long running fighting franchise.  Featuring a horde of fighters, undoubtadly the best lineup yet, Tekken 5 features the same deep gameplay and combo mechanics that will keep you playing for quite some time.  And because it's Tekken, there's a bevy of hidden characters and features to unlock as well.  There's no Tekken Force mode this time around, and instead there is Devil Within, a segment that is similar to Tekken Force where you play as Jin Kazama as he battles his way to learn of the devil gene within him.  It's not much to write home about in itself, but there's more features to behold here as well, including the addition of playing the arcade versions of Tekken 1, 2, and 3 as well as the Namco shooter Starblade.  The graphics are improved and the backgrounds have been revamped as well, all helping make Tekken 5 the best fighter not just for the PS2, but for home consoles in general.  For veterans to the series and newcomers alike, Tekken 5 is a masterpiece, and essential to every PS2 owner's library	1
258754	I had similar difficulties with this hi-def adapter. For one thing, the plugs were nearly impossible to get into the sockets. And once I did get them on, all I got was a black screen. But thanks to a friend, I figured out what the problem was:	1
262977	The game when you first buy it is awsome. i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters, make people fly 20 yards with your finger, and bunt-kick a police car down 5 blocks? the game lasts a bit because of the "smash smash get some cash" gameplay (the more smash points you get, the more moves you get). the moves are the best part. at one point in the game, you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss. i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street... its alot better then skateboarding on a  bus if you ask me. anyway, once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers, it gets extremely repetitive.	1
263153	5 stars is a very low number compared to how good this game is.  Light jak is freakin awesome, after awhile u really get attached to this game and of course the charchters themselves.	1
264934	This is the first wireless controller that I have ever used that didn't LAG constantly.  In fact mine has never lagged not even when the batteries were low.  The range is more than enough for any room in my home.  Actually I have taken it outside between online mathces and kept chatting with the other players so it even works through doors and windows.  Great product that I now have two of them and have retired the wired controller	1
270903	It's a very good product but it only can be shipped within U.S., so I can't buy i	1
277342	You get to be different animals. It is a really cool game. I recommend it to other kids to buy. The cheetah get shoot bow and arrows	1
279797	I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership.  I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it.  The software is very well done and it really does have "real time feedback."  If I'm leaning forward when I'm not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say "try standing up straight."  I am definitely getting a great work out.  10 more weeks and I'll let you know if it did any good or not.  So far it seems to be helping.	1
283001	For Anyone Who Loves Football And Everything About It Knows Their Is Also A Dark Side Of The Game. Where Players Take Illegal Drugs To Help Out Their Game,Where Owners Will Do Anything For Their Team To Win. This Game Is Alot Like Any Given Sunday. Remember Win At Any Cos	1
284656	There is so much to see and discover in this game. It took me over 70 hours just to complete the walkthrough and I am still working on capturing all the monsters for the Monster Arena. Someone who wanted to complete all side quests, find all special items, etc. could easily spend more than 100 hours on this game and never get bored -just incredibly deep gameplay. The graphics are also outstanding, among the best I have seen in a video game. It took me awhile to get used to the Sphere Grid used to increase your characters' stats. At first I didn't find it as satisfying as the typical method of "leveling up". But eventually I began to enjoy it and it's now one of my favorite aspects of the game. The only thing I found tiresome was how long the cutscenes were. The storyline itself was quite good. But I wish it was told with shorter cutscenes or at least gave players the option to skip through the cutscenes. Still this is a minor complaint to an otherwise excellent game. Definitely worth buying!	1
289383	Much has been said about the technical aspects or systems requirements of the game, as have many reviews for Oblivion and other next-gen or advanced games on the market today.  Caesar III was quite old, the sequel was always going to be further along with the system demands.  It was worth the wait.	1
292545	This title is the tre sequel to Railroad Tycoon. If you loved the old 1990's original, you'll enjoy this one as well. Only con to the game is replayablity, which is very limited	1
295275	My son is enthralled with this game!  He is learning while being entertained.  The graphics are exceptional, music is great, situations are complex and challenging and it works on the MAC!  What more could we ask for	1
300757	The Destroy All Humans series is brilliant. With #2, you are now in the 1960s, with hippies and KBG agents all around you.	1
309631	I agree with nearly everyone's reviews, so I wont go over it again, but...	1
309639	If you have an RPG bone in your body, back in the days of paper RPG who didnt dream of a game where you could roam creepy tombs fighting the undead, finding magic loot, avoiding traps, all with near cartoon quality graphics..	1
312867	I find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see.  However, my major disappointment comes from the graphics.  I understand the ps2 doesn't not have the standards of the XBox360, but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for.  I just hope when the ps3 comes out, Madden will rerelease the game for it to give the XBox360 owners something to whine about.  EA should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have	1
314985	If you already have an Eye Toy and your favorite game on it is Beat Freak, then you have to get Eye Toy Groove.  The 28 tracks on it cover 40 years of great dance music, from Elvis to Good Charlotte.  As a 46 year old woman, I got this as an alternative of boring, repetitive workout tapes, with great success - the game even has a calorie counter built in.   This is also a fun game for me to play with my three kids, ages from 8 to 16.   Even the preschoolers I occasionally babysit enjoy the special effects in the chill out room, and the lyrics in all the songs are suitable for family listening, which is more than I can say for Dance Dance Revolution	1
315058	I am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original Disgaea. As such I will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note. Having said that, let's begin.	1
315721	Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus is said to be the last spin off (aside PSP's Crisis Core), and the one that goes furthest into the future of the VII world. The game seems like a must-play for Final Fantasy VII and Vincent Valentine fans alike, and it is. Thinking, most of those fans probably play mostly RPGs, this game is relatively easier than popular FPS (shooters) like Halo. Being an RPG-fan, yet still wanting to learn the story of the game, I was very happy for the easy difficulty (though it can be bumped up to something more difficult and there are plenty of extras that are difficult to get outside the story mode.) The controls are a little bad, but nothing that someone can't get used to. For one of Square's second or third shooter games, this one is pretty good.	1
319620	I am 23 years old and this game hasn't left my DS since I bought it a month ago. It's incredibly fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes fast paced minigames. You get rated bronze, silver, or gold for your cooking. I love these weird japanese games! I only gave it 4 stars overall because there is not a lot of replay value once you have received gold on all 74 or so recipes. I heard they are making a Wii version of cooking mama, so I'm hoping that one will have more recipes	1
320566	This game is fun- you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities.  You can even go the wrong way.  For me (older adult) it was fun to play with my kids, but I found it repetitive and boring after a while.  Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game	1
322155	I've pretty much been partial to the Playstation controllers since I got my PS1 back in 1997.  When I saw the Nintendo 64 controller, I nearly puked.  The joystick in the middle didn't make any sense to me.  I looked at the GameCube controller, and wasn't exactly impressed.  It looked kinda goofy-asymmetric, maybe.	1
325456	I put a great deal of interest in my purchases. With a lot of extra down-time at work and an internet connection, I find myself reviewing EVERYTHING before I buy it. And only after I am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will I take out my credit card. But this product, the Microsoft XBOX360 Media Remote, was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway. Let me tell you...	1
332398	Half-Life made its debut in 1998, and it shocked the entire world. Half-Life at the time featured stunning graphics, gameplay, and sound. It was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands, and still to this date Half-Life is a game that every action-game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success. Shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended, two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again, but made it scream.	1
337986	This game is great for when you have a group of friends come over. It really breaks the ice between you and anybody you may not be familiar with and it is incredibly entertaining.  I suggest this game for everybody	1
339994	Fable has reached the point where all RPGs dream of going. It's absolutely the pinnacle of the Adventure criteria. The creators put you in the game, they make it fun, and they make it interesting. Fable is the game that absolutely defines the whole light side/dark side thing. Because no other game concentrates on the subtle, small, important details and leisures quite like Fable does. People will learn to adore you, and people will learn to fear you, you have a life, you're not just some dummy on a string being instructed on exactly what to do.	1
341423	I have the original for the DS lite.  I thought that was fun, but this is better.  The first few chapters seem the same, but the gameplay is better.	1
343944	Of all the Karaoke games we have used, this is by far the best.  It's fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters.  It has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have.  THere are the are different options, like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score.  Hours of FUN, FUN, FUN!!	1
346560	They're nice cards, I never had a problem. Since I had 3 PS2s in my house at the time, we kept mixing up memory cards or my brothers would steal mine... then my boyfriend bought me these and I always had my own memory cards, no one else could say they were theirs or anything else. The only problem I can think of is that they are a little expensive	1
349797	I have now played "VP2" for a few days now, and I have to say that I like it. It has its problems, but overall, it is a very fun game.	1
351975	I thoroughly enjoyed playing Final Fantasy VIII.  From the introductory movie I was hooked.  The world and story were very unique, as well as the new battle system.  I thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once I got used to it, I loved it more than the materia system of VII.  The characters in VIII were all very likeable.  It was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named Squall, who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the Final Fantasy series.   The cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments.  From start to finish, I had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the Final Fantasy series and role playing games in general.	1
356063	I love the xbox 360,I got it about 2 months ago.I remember my friend saying wait for the ps3,i told him im not waiting for that overhyped overpriced system.The xbox 360 live is amazing and is so much fun.The graphics and sound are great to.I dont have an hd tv either but you can tell a great deal of difference(you need real cables people.dont use the cheap ones that come with it and use the components not the stupid yellow video plug).The wireless controllers are great.the main thing are games,theres good ones and bad ones,choose very wisely.But there alot of good ones right now to choose from.And make sure you get the xbox with the 20 gig hard drive,theres no other way to have it	1
360310	This headset is probably the best xbox live recommended headset to date. Everything on the earpiece is adjustable to fit every size of ear. The big xbox live headsets are uncomfortable and begin to hurt after about a half hours use. Wearing the Halo 2 headset i actually forgot that I was even wearing it because it is so light. They have just released a new version of this headset that also comes the communicator with no difference in price. I greatly recommend this headset to anyone that plays xbox live on a regular basis	1
362319	very scary at first, i was literely shaking while playing this game, i couldn't stop playing it!!	1
364059	I ordered this set primarily for LOTR: Return of the King, but after I got it, it turns out my graphics chip was not powerful enough to play it. But I was able to play the other three games and I really enjoyed Freedom Fighters and Medal of Honor. Black and White was okay but I wasn't able to get into it. But it should be noted that with Black and White you get both the original game and the expansion pack Creature Isle. So you are really getting five games instead of four. So I highly recommend this set if you are want to play some good, but not so modern games and spend little money	1
365736	First off, this game's graphics are not mind-blowing.  They are very good, but they are not as beautiful as the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3.  That said, that is not the reason that you buy this game.  The game has amazing replayability because of it's amazing controls and fun factor.  You turn the Wii remote on its side and use it as a steering wheel.  When on a massive jump, use the "steering wheel" to change your pitch and land safely.  Perfect landings are met with speed boosts.  Playing this game with friends is a blast.  Your friends will be wowed by the controls and then wowed by the fun they're having.	1
369824	I was a little late to the booming cult following that Phoenix Wright has acquired, having just bought the game this month. However, it did not dissapoint. I was always a fan of the point and click adventures on the PC but was dissapointed with Trace Memory, not so much that it was a bad game but it was soo short. I was hesitant to spend the money again on a game I could beat in about 10 hours time, but luckily I did. Phoenix Wright is one of those games that has enough challenge to it that you don't feel like you are breezing effortlessly through it, yet is open enough for younger players to be able to play and enjoy it as well. The length of the game is fairly long, with five cases to solve, each one becoming longer and more difficult as you play. I must say you really get into the characters in this game as each case is connected in some way to the others, and I really liked the last case that added the use of luminol and finger printing tools (makes you feel all CSI, and stuff ;) ). I look forward to the second one coming out soon, and definately recommend this as one of the best on the DS right now	1
370450	Nothing bad to mention it. this control is the original. works very well. good price	1
373101	This game has been out for a while. And I have been playing it for a long time now. Have I ever had a boring moment while playing GTA: SA? No... I honestly have cherished every moment of gameplay. Why? Because this game has so much content and capability, that it is not possible to dislike this game if you have actually sat down to play and appreciate it. People giving GTA: SA low ratings must be joking.	1
377485	im a western fanatic i just love the wild west. I try to get my eyes or hands on anything western, wild west tech, desperados, wild wild west, gbatu, so far this game is AWESOME i cant wait for the new western game GUN coming out in nov. one thing this game needs though is... the good the bad and the ugly theme :)	1
380050	As the title suggests Sacred Underworld is pretty much the same as Sacred but a little better.  So if you like Sacred, Sacred Underworld is very well worth playing.	1
380478	Well, I must say after purchasing the Linksys WGA11B Wireless-B Game Adapter that while yes this adapter is overpriced, it does work and considering that I only got the Linksys adapter to work once and then it shut down in the middle of an update I must say the price looked worth it.	1
384080	I bought Paper Mario 2 for my neice to play when she comes over to visit, now she comes over to play the game.  It has an interesting story line and many characters to interact with.  The puzzles are only moderatly hard so she hasn't gotten stuck and lost interest, but the story is long enough that we haven't just breezed through it either.  It's better if you take so side trips to work the "missions" and fight in the arena (where you can build up your levels faster).  You can also revisit previous lands and re-fight the random encounters.	1
388311	This game is pretty cool u are in a 4 man squad made up of you the Leader (Orange) Scorch the demoshing guy (yellow) Fixer the guy who hacks into stuff (green) and Sev the sniper (red). I in this game it basicly is the battle of geonsis and wht happens from there to eposode 3. And amazingly it is almost just like halo! Ad in some parts has more blood to it like when you stab a alien with your knife the blood shoots on your visor (yes this game has more than robots). anyhow this game is becoming out dated so by it here. you'll love it	1
388929	Its Gran Turismo, theres really nothing more to say. I own all the titles in this franchise and I have never been disappointed with any one of em. The series is really amazing. With every new release it only gets better. People should also try Tourist Trophy which is setting another standard in moto racing.	1
389718	Cicken Little is a fantastic game. This game is full of diffrent things like little bit of fighting, sports, unioform hunt and more.The best part I like is the Carpool Craze.	1
397385	The XBOX 360 Live 12 month kit is the best deal for anyone who needs to sign up or renew their Live account, even if you do have the headset. The card itself is $50, and the points, bonus game, and $20 dollars off a new game (limited time offer) easily helps to make your money back. Even if they didn't include the rebate, it would still be less than buying these parts separate. In fact, it's almost like you're getting a headset for free!	1
397458	For newcomers to the saga, jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it.  However, if you've already been sucked in by the first two, you should find this to be quite enjoyable.  A few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore.  The story line, of course, is stillthe main focus ofthe game.  So, if you've been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew...this game will give it to you.  I, however, do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line	1
402486	Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game. Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe ? revealed in one of multiple epilogues.	1
405858	It's a fun game. If you like Super Mario don't miss. It wasn't as good as previous classic games like SMB, SMB 3, or SMBW but it sure is fun. I played every level except the last one is too hard. I looked up the video on YouTube and decided that was good enough. I hate, hate, hate, when levels are too hard and you have to be a computer to pass them. The last level is the only hard one. I tried about 25 times and gave up and watched the video online. If a game is too hard I'm not going to sit there all day doing the same thing over and over again. This is a great game... except for that last frustratingly repetitious level	1
410914	Awesome game, loads of fun.	1
412963	Castlevania: Curse of Darkness is a game that even the die-hard Castlevania fan might not much get into. Lament of Innocence wasn't a terrible game, but it wasn't great. And Curse of Darkness just goes to show that when a 3D Castlevania game marches forth, it has problems. Sometimes scary problems. Like Lament of Innocence, it had so much potential to be good--this title more so. But it doesn't deliver, and that's a sad revelation to admit to, especially after having so much enjoyment with the DS smash: Dawn of Sorrow.	1
413615	Star Wars KOTOR 2 is a decent game overall and well worth playing if you like good RPG's. It starts off much stronger then the first game and has a very similar mid game. I felt that the end game was weaker when compared to the first but still very decent	1
414579	If you are about to switch to an Xbox 360, buy this game first as your last Xbox game, you won't be disappointed. This game has the best graphics I have ever seen on a console. Although it has great graphics, the physics are the real selling point. You can pick up virtually anything in the world and throw it around or stack it with the Gravity Gun (Zero-Point Energy Manipulator). Barrels float in the water like they should and explosions are suprisingly realistic. The enemies and challenging and varied and dead bodies flop around like they should (especially when you shoot them with the shotgun). The voice acting is very well done and characters will turn to look at you if you move around. The only drawback is choppy framerates at times. Highly recommended	1
415616	I bought this game on PS2 for my daughter who is 12, and she has had a ball playing it. Though there are English subtitles because it is spoken in very fast Japanese, that doesn't take away from the game's adventures. The instructions given are very clear, and though it does take skill to master some of the tasks,  it really is quite enjoyabl	1
415621	I will keep this review short. The game is a very addictive, entertaining RPG. Great story, great gameplay, best game I played all year. Only thing that it was lacking was a lock on feature for enemies. Took me about 45 hours to complete the Main story and almost all of the side missions. If you buy this game you WILL play it to the end	1
417092		1
418360	This is my second PS2. I traded my first on in on a Xbox 360, which only  lasted 91 days before it died (read all about it in my 360 review). Leary of version 1.0 PS3, I opted to go back to the PS2 and its proven reliability and copious games for less money. I got a set of HDTV cables, a wireless controller, and have not looked back. What a fool I was to fall for Microscams empty promises! This is the best game system! You can even play online for free! The games are more challenging and last a lot longer than the 360 games ,which I could beat in a week, playing an hour a day. The warranty is awesome at 1 year parts and labor! I am not worried,however, because I had my original PS2 for 10 years without issue before trade-in! A fantastic system at an unbeatable price! I will keep this one for at least a year before trading it in on a PS3 ,once all of the bugs are fixed and the price goes down to $400..........Until then, long live the PS2!!!	1
421181	Graphically, this game is a work of art. The shiny surfaces, glowing lightsabers, and vibrant colors make this a winner.	1
421605	This is one of the best racing games I have ever played. You can do so many modifications to your car	1
424450	I first got this game about 2 years ago for computer.  Back then, I had a really slow computer, and it didn't work right.  I was so mad that I had wasted 40 dollars on it.  It went on the shelf and waited there for 2 years.  Now I have a better computer and play it all the time.  The earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult, not so.  The guy must have obviously been a moron, and not been able to figure out the puzzles, because the game has an average difficulty, and if he wants it easier, he can play on Padawan.  Anyway, the game is basically a first person shooter based game, where you go around blasting storm troopers, probe droids, and more.  I suggest getting this game because I really enjoy playing it, and I want to get it for XBOX too	1
426955	The introduction ISN'T boring, it ISN'T long, and it IS one of the best introductions to a game made by Enix/SE.  If you don't like the omg 25 min to wste on into2111!!!1, then don't buy another RPG for as long as you live.  RPGs are supposed to have stories, and this one is no different.  If you don't like it, take it back and get a refund... don't play RPG's like this if you can't stand words.  Go play some GTA or something--- oh wait, theres words in that too	1
431450	when i first saw the game for number 5 on top games. I new i wanted it. My littlwe bro like eww that game is horrible. I ask my grandma 2 buy it for me and it so fun. I lov it if u like games that r easy than play this on	1
434761		1
439809	Quite simply, it's great, though a bit on the challenging side.  Gorgeous art style and some great music come together for an atmospheric title, and one that, despite it's 'rated 'E' for everyone' approach, will appeal to adults as well as kids.  It's not without some light frustration, but the good far outweighs the bad.	1
440910	I don't really review games, because videogames are nothing much to talk about.	1
446571	This product is excellent. Has not malfunctioned like some other brands where info becomes inaccessible after some time.	1
451104	This product arrived quickly and in excellent shape. Thanks for  being a quality shop. This  product is hard to find in a store. Thanks again	1
456195	I've done most of the Nancy Drew games now, and a couple CSI and Law and Order games. Nancy Drew has better graphics and is actually harder in some cases than CSI. I also had so many problems with bugs with the CSI and Law and Order games, not so with Nancy Drew. And a real plus is my 7 year old can play them with me	1
458513	I dont know what everyone else's reviews have said but beleieve me this game is awesome!  The graphics are out of this world, and its very suspenseful.  There's a murder or dead body around every corner, and you get to firgure out who did it!  The ending was the best, it took me and my brother at least 24 hours, (not all at once of course), to solve this mystery.  It's a really great buy! ~Andre	1
460560	My husband brought this game home and I thought, "Oh no, I guess we're not having multisyllable conversations for the next few weeks..." But to my surprise not only did he ABSOLUTELY love this game but I would sit next to him and watch, totally transfixed by the amazing detail and effort that the creators poured into this game. I caught myself saying, "Baby, aren't you going to play your game?" This game is incredible and while I am not at all a gamer I'm tempted to try it out! Everyone not shocked by gore (and I mean LOTS of gore) should play this game. Every game should be this well made.	1
461306	Amazon.com has listed this as the "King's Quest Compilation" instead of the "King's Quest Collection" which is clearly printed on my box for the game, as well as the picture on the website. I don't know why that is.	1
463377	Xenosaga II-Jenseits von Gut und Boese came in November to Europe and was the first Xenosaga, which was released here!!! But we European players never played Xenosaga I before, so Namco released the second Xenosaga in a great "Special Box". In this box was the game itself and a Movie-DVD with nearly all Xenosaga I movies.	1
467198	Disclaimer:  I am not employed by or associated in any way with the game's publisher or developer.  I am just another consumer.	1
469318	I bought 2 of these controllers for my kids, because I didn't want cables in the middle of our Family Room nor did I want them sitting too close to the TV when they played.	1
469326	the shipment came fast, and was packaged well, in all a great thin	1
470781	At TGS (Tokyo Game Show) 2005, Sony of Japan announced that they were developing an original game for PSP: LocoRoco. Instead of the usual ports or re-creations or compliations of retro games, LocoRoco is a completely new venture. It focuses on a fictional planet where happy LocoRocos (yellow blobs) and MuiMuis (blue figures) live. One day, it is invaded by the Moja Troop, who eat LocoRoco. Your job is to tilt the surface to lead LocoRocos through their planet without getting eaten. You collect flowers, which gives you another LocoRoco. You can combine and separate LocoRocos, as well. You collect bugs as a food source for LocoRocos. Additionally, when you collect MuiMuis, you can get house parts.	1
474549	Maybe I'm strange but I liked the game.  The only thing I didn't like is the zoom in feature.  I felt that could've been handled by a button push like in COD3.	1
479395	This game is great. Both the missions and the things you do on your own (like extortion) make this game an awesome part of anyone's collection. I only found one thing wrong with the game. When you reach the rank of "Don", everyone still talks to you as i you were at the bottom of the barrel. For instance, when talking to one of the corleone men, they will still say something like, "hey kid stay outta trouble". This game, although great, can still use a little fine tuning.	1
480058	This game is literally the alpha and the omega of its genre.	1
483552	I unlike a lot of other people did not buy this game when it first came out.  My initial thought was what was Squar thinking.  I was thinking this could be nothing more than a childs game.  It wasnt until I talked to a number of other people, right before KH2 came out did i finaly listen to all those people and spend the $20 to get the game, (as was the price of the game by then,) and low and behold, by the time I finished watching just the opening scene I was hooked.  I played that game for what seemed like hours on in, (it was really only a very long weekend.) But that game became so addicting I immediatly went out and bought the second one the day it came out.  The story line was on par with that of Final Fantasy X, and Final Fantasy VII, my two favorit games in the world. I would recomend this game to anyone with even the slightes bit of imagination.  If you can even dare to dream you will instantly love this game as I did.  It was well worth the price, and my only regret is that i did not buy it sooner	1
493923	This game is really great. I would recommend this game to anyone. It's a great game to play with the family or by yourself. I have had this game for awhile now and have finished it about 2 times. The first time i've finished it, it was kinda challenging on the last level, but when I went over it again I zipped right threw it. This game doesn't get you bored at all you'll be into it right from the beginning of the game. I like how you can choose whoever you want during the game. The graphics well they aren't as great as the movie. But overall it's awesome. I will play it over and over again. It's great!!!!!!!!!!!	1
498987	This is a wonderful gift for any girl gamer.  I love mine	1
502769	I played through the first Halo and really enjoyed the single-player campaign.  I never played the multiplayer game until I bought Halo 2.	1
509169	I have owned the first DS since the day it came out. I bought the DS Lite about a week after it came out and I was amazed of the changes. It is so much lighter and is just a lot better to have than the original. The screen emits about as much light as the sun. It is like DLP technology compared to a regular TV. Plus, most of the games look loads better. Sme people say there is a stress crack, but I have had mine since June and it is still in very good condition. My advice is to you to buy this DS Lite and you will have made a good choice	1
512343	This is a really nice remake of a great classic (FFIV).  They improved the dialogue, and added in a lot of great items.  The challenge level, however, was bumped up significantly.  The game was originally paced so you didn't have to spend nearly as much time leveling up.  A few of the bosses surprised me this time through (I've played the SNES version multiple times in my day).  The story is unchanged, however.  A must have for any FF/Classic RPG fan!  As a bonus, I finally got to play Chrono Trigger	1
518720	If you have always wanted a turn based strategy game in a fantasy setting with no limits then Dominions II is really the only option out there. Its not perferct but its darn good.	1
518882	The first time Final Fantasy V was releasd in America was with the Final Fantasy Anthology package.  Now the game is where it belongs.  On a handheld system.  The GBA is pretty much at the end of its life, but it still manages to get a satisfactory game every now and then.  Final Fantasy V is by no means the best in the series, but it is, for the most part, an RPG that deserves appreciation and acclaim.	1
519429	This WiiPoints card, which is the equivalent of $20, allows one to purchase and download games from the Wii's virtual console, part of the Wii Shop channel. Already, at launch, 12 games throughout the history of gaming were available, including Pinball (Nintendo Entertainment System), Sonic the Hedgehog (Sega Genesis), SimCity (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), and Super Mario 64 (Nintendo 64). Nintendo is planning to add new games every Monday, to come to a total of 30 by the end of the year. Beyond that, "new classics" are coming throughout 2007 such as Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars (Super Nintendo), and Mario Kart 64 (Nintendo 64). Many of these games can be controlled with the included Wii Remote or the backwards-compatible GameCube controllers. Some require the Wii Classic Controller, but a great number use the other two aforementioned control methods	1
527015	No, this game isn't perfect - you'll be annoyed by the dialogue (luckily you can fast forward through it) and the cut scenes (unfortunately you CAN'T fast forward through those).  BUT it's filled with tons of things to solve, and if you get stuck, you can have the game solve it for you.  This game will keep you busy for a while...but fair warning, it's CORNY	1
532585	I can't believe someone would try selling a memory card for more than 25 dollars.  You are being ripped off if you have to pay more than 10 dollars for one, but unfortunately, if you live in the country like me, finding a store nearby selling Playstation 2 memory cards would probably be nearly impossible.  So you're forced to shop for one online.	1
533427	I've been a fan of the Prince of Persia series since I was a little kid. PoP 1 was great, Pop 2 was absolutely unreal. PoP 3D was ehhh....but then two years ago, along came a game that changed everything. "Prince of Persia The Sands of Time," the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone's breath away. The gameplay was original, flawless, and beautiful. The storyline sucked you in and didn't let you go even after you'd beaten it 6 times over. It was a flawless game.	1
535668	This game when released was the best 1st person shooter console game available. But today with  doom and half life versions for xbox, there is actually something to compare halo to, and it doesn't stand up.	1
536594	I honestly HATE fighting games.  I think they're boring and they don't offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by.	1
537159	Brings back the good old days of playing these games after school	1
542881	I also am a huge monkey ball fan and also own them all and this one is just as good as not better than the others.. game play is awsome with the new control system and as for the old target game.. their are a few target games on this one.. if you dont like monkey target then try paraglider for a much harder and funner game. This games has so many games that are fun with friends of all ages.. snowboarding, a few racing, disk golf, free throw, hovercraft battle, boxer, bowling, fencing, sling shot, and so many more.. [..	1
544726	The game when you first buy it is awsome. i mean who wouldent want to throw cars at helicopters, make people fly 20 yards with your finger, and bunt-kick a police car down 5 blocks? the game lasts a bit because of the "smash smash get some cash" gameplay (the more smash points you get, the more moves you get). the moves are the best part. at one point in the game, you get a move that lets you grab onto a helicopter or a big boss. i always loved riding the helicopter to 5th street... its alot better then skateboarding on a  bus if you ask me. anyway, once you get all the moves and beat the story mode AND get the canadian boxers, it gets extremely repetitive.	1
544994	Note:  This review is spoiler free with regards to the game's story	1
547859	When I upgraded to the 360 I was a bit saddened that I would not be able to use my controller with a built in fan, but these wireless controllers are amazing.	1
556021	There is only one thing that any self respecting geek loves more than Dungeons and Dragons and that is Star Wars.  This game is the marriage of those two wonderful geeky things. It is a flawless game	1
556975	When it comes to the GC/GBA Cable.  You wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games.  But it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in Gamecube games, sometimes it gives you access to secret areas/maps/items and various other thing.	1
565299	I'm so glad I listened to the fine reviewers on Amazon and bought this game ... it was worth every penny and then some!!  It has a lot of really great game play and I love how the babies are used in conjunction with the adults to accomplish various tasks.  I feel like the game play is also very natural for the characters ... you wouldn't feel right about Mario and Luigi casting spells like the characters from Final Fantasy, but it's perfect to have them jumping and smashing with hammers and flinging turtle shells.  And as weird as that sounds, it makes for a great RPG.  Lots of good side-missions too, like collecting the beans.  Wonderful game!	1
567052	I have all the "Grand Theft" games and this is one of my favs.I highly recommend it and all the others.I recently purchased "Liberty City" Awesome	1
570391	I wanted this workout "game" to get back into shape after having a baby. It is a great workout including cardio, combat, isolation for abs, arms or legs, and mind and body including yoga and tai chi-type exercises. I love that it tells you what day to work out (and if you don't you fail that day!) and it increases the intensity of the workouts based on your previous performance. There are several different workouts in each segment so each workout is truely unique to help prevent burnout. Your workouts are assigned a letter grade based on your performance so it motivates me to get the allusive "A", which is hard to achieve (and it should be!). I am in week 8 of the 12 week program and I can definintely feel my muscles are more toned and firm after not working out for a year. I love that Nike helped produce the game.	1
571833	Final Fantasy III, as most may know, was the only Final Fantasy game that failed to reach North America.  Well now it haas been revived, and it's better than ever before!	1
574200	Ico was a game that was very different from others. It focused on puzzle solving and had a short but unforgettable story mixed with fantastic visuals and audio. Imagine what Ico would be if action were incorporated into it, you would have something like Shadow of the Colossus, Ico's prequel. SoTC is a colossal achievement on many different levels.	1
576663	Really nice headset except for the fact that if your a gamer that spends alot of time on Xbox Live with this headset on it can start to hurt a little bit. You can adjust the volume from barely being able to hear the person or basically to making it seem like they are yelling. Very small and it does plug into the charger very well if someone says that they have to hold it in with a rubber band or tape then they messed it up somehow because the headset stays in nice and firm. This is a MUST for people that cannot stand a cord getting in their way for their headset on xbox live or XB Connect/Xlink. It has VERY good range (i can walk outside with the door closed about 50 or so steps away and i still get reception.) Overall if you have a Xbox and want to talk to other people online get this headset it is very nice	1
576706	This is the best game ever! If you want to play with your love ones, this is the best game to have with. You can be addicted to it sometimes, but that's a good sign for a good gam	1
577841	I have to say this is a game that was worth every dollar spent!   It's a game that I will keep for life and probably play again someday! I don't know what the previous Final Fantasy games were like so for me there is no comparison. I think I'm totally biased toward Final Fantasy X. The two coolest aspects about this game, for me, are the Aeons and Blitzball. The other thing I like about this game is the storyline, the characters and the beautiful scenary. I forgot to mention how great the music is also. I've been reading reviews about current and previous Final Fantasy games and the thing that is still missing for me is, the Aeons and Blitzball. I'm also attached to the characters in Final Fantasy X. Even the sequel doesn't cut it for me right now. For me, it's Final Fantasy X all the way	1
584306	For all of you out there who love destruction..  Who love seeking sweet revenge on someone who knocks you out of a lap, or tosses your sorry butt into the drink; this is the game for you.  One of the basic foundations of this game is destruction.  Even when you're knocked around, beaten down, crushed, humiliated and...etc, you gain points with the craziness of your crash.	1
586708	Story (10/10):	1
589969	I've never taken the time to write a review before, but all of the negative comments made me feel obligated to defend this game. A number of the negative reviews point out that many aspects of the game are far simpler in Railroads as compared to RRT3, which is absolutely correct. If you are seeking a complex simulation, Railroads is not the game for you. If, however, you are wanting a fun and easy to grasp game with trains, then I wholeheartedly recommend Railroads. It is one of my favorite games of all time	1
594053	This game is very fun and has lots of action that is for sure.  Many people may find this good enough for the game to satisfy them, but I am not one of them.  The mythology part is good and the creatures and gods are described and portrayed very well, but the plot to the campaign messes it all up.  The last campaign was much larger and it was more fun.  I was disappointed in the new campaign.  I'd say the first one is better.  If you make a big deal about graphics though, than this game is for you.  It has excellent graphics and features.  The ocean and mountain looks so realistic.  They do a good job showing you underwater.  These graphics blow away the graphics of the Age of Empires series.  If you were expecting a good campaign, your not going to be very happy.  Plot isnt so good and its very short.  It has about half of the other games campaigns.  A big difference is that in normal games the titans always come out.  They're kind of annoying.  Overall this game is good but not as good as the prequal.	1
595543	I bought this memory for my kids, since hey were advancing in video playing and weren't able to save their achievements. This memory has lots of storage and now they advance faster to new levels. I think is the best out there	1
603848	I very much enjoyed this game and I think it may be my favorite X-BOX game I own!I Kinda agree with the person that said that this game was pretty short,but it does not make it any less better!One funny part about this game is the part where you are Sunny for the first time in the game and have to jump to each pipe and the whole time she is just sitting there laughing her head off!I reccomend this game for people that like games that are fun,educational,and very durable	1
6077	I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.	0
18983	Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge.	0
23639	To be honest with you I thought the movie was really bad. the acting was ok but the only good part about the movie was that ricky (Rodney Eastman) was in the movie. (for about 5 mins) but i would not suggest renting this movie and waisting 4 dollars	0
33036	They SUCK! Bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established Chapelle humor. It was like watching Mind of Mencia. Two thumbs down, leave this one alone.	0
47484	This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him	0

60231	The most simple definition of [...] is sexual gratuitousness. Sexual imaging for the sake of turning people on, not providing anything pertinent to the plot.	0
66182	This movie is a disaster. There is not one single memorable performance by the cast of "stars". If you want to see a little boy happily running to school, get hit by a car, walk home injured and die, have at it.  There is a reason that this movie is deeply discounted by Amazon. Criterion is probably losing money on this release and they desire it. They should be is ashame	0
69114	It is obvious that this movie is full of lies.  Although I have not actually seen it, I know this to be true because I have seen many discussions on the movie on the Fox news channel (God bless them!).  The way he attacks poor Mr. Heston is deplorable.  Can't Michael Moore tell from the comments Charlton made at the rallies that he doesn't have his faculties about him?  I am also unsure that Mr. Heston even said the things that the movie shows him saying.  The ability of Hollywood to manipulate and edit sound is truly amazing, making it appear that My President (Heston) is an uncaring, babbling idiot by simply using his own words - shame on you Michael!  And as for the way he got the gun from the bank, I agree with the other posters that the entire point of a bank giving away free guns is completely nullified by the fact that they didn't give him the gun the minute he walked into the bank.  Bravo to those who figured that out.  Also, Michael Moore is fat.  Take that Pinkie	0
79382	Ok, this is by far the most pathetic taping of a show (although Sweeney Todd comes to a close second).  Where is the show?!  They cut out the "Glory" battle scene and just had the actors come out and look happy instead of creepy like they should when they do the slow-mo battle scene (that was not in the movie...).  Also, where is "I Guess I'll Miss the Man?"  That's a BEAUTIFUL song that was cut from the movie why?  Also what about "Prayer for a Duck" and MANY others!!!  This is by far the worst ladies and gentlemen and completely ruins the show created by Stephen Schwartz and the great Bob Fosse!	0
89435	I have a 2 year old and have seen him on all the Kids Channels.  I was hoping the DVD would show each of his songs as they are performed on TV.  Instead it was like a concert and did not keep my attention nor my sons.  This would have been a better CD instead of a DV	0
98921	I was disappointed after the first 30 minutes and realized this was a bad knock off between "The Gospel" and "The Fighting Temptations".  I would not recommend purchasing.  You are better off renting	0
107807	I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- "There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings" is very cold compared with Bogart's "Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?"  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all	0
113563	Leeches is a terrible movie.  Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director's other film Speed Demon).  When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign.  The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director's work.	0

133882	I would love to review this Lions Gate DVD, but I can't catch one word in ten.  It is NOT, as advertised, closed-captioned, and the characters' speech is too casual and British for me to get.  Drat! -- I was so chuffed to see there was a cc version	0
147397	The &quot;Latin&quot; moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks	0
156774	I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.	0
160535	Let me just preface my review with the fact that some of my favorite movies are incredibly slow and even "boring" to my friends.  So it isn't the glacial pace of this movie that so bothered me.  It isn't the unresolved ending that bothered me.  It wasn't the violence (in short bursts.)  It wasn't the acting (the acting was pretty good actually).  But as a whole this movie was simply a tremendous failure.  I didn't care who was sending the tapes and I didn't care what would happen with the main characters.  They were unrelatable on just about any level.  This movie is the kind where you will see a remotely interesting twist in the plot about 3/4's of the way in and you'll think, "wow I wonder where the story will go next".  And then it doesn't.  That was it.  Very disappointing.  I don't mind excruciatingly slow films as long as there's SOME kinda payoff in the end.  I really don't understand all the acclaim that this movie got.  As a "suspense" movie or as an "art" film it fails pretty miserably.  The premise was a good idea that went nowhere...slowly.  Viewer beware.	0
166373	While some critics can argue with Dan Brown's research and reasoning on certain historical points, one thing these Da Vinci "debunking" presentations will never be able to refute is this: the downplaying of the feminine role in western civilization and Christianity, primarily by the Catholic Church, and the fact that the Church still considered Mary Magdalene a common prostitute until just a few short years ago: 1969. Nor is it possible to refute the recent polymorphously perverse scandals that have rocked the Church after centuries of suppression and may have everything to do with the doctrinal distortions that Dan Brown has brought out in the open for serious review. This institution is in trouble because it is seriously out of balance with itself and has cut off its spiritual nose to despite its face by downplaying or denigrating the role of women as sacred beings and bearers of the Light, when their healthy presence is needed more than ever as a corrective to some of these abuses and scandals. Dan Brown has done the world a great service by showing how the feminine role in the divine was written out 2000 years ago, with help from Peter whose misogynistic views of women are plainly evident in the scriptures even today and are still, quite frankly, shocking and debasing. Sorry, but upon this "Rock" of male dominancy was built the Church.	0
172203	There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this "movie" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film supposedly deals with a woman who has an accident and is "touched" by a sex angel only to discover she is a sex addict and the twelfth sex apostle... Need I say more?	0
179392	Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.	0
187484	What a HUGE disappointment this release is.  I was suspecting that it wouldn't be all that great when I saw that the studio that originally produced this show, 20th Century Fox, was the same video company releasing it.  Well, the first season looks horrible.  The source material is all 16mm dupe prints, some parts of which are out of focus, scratched and dirty.  In all cases the image is soft and, well, like 16mm.  Compared to what Fox is releasing of VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, produced the same year (1964) and at the same studio as BOONE, this release is nothing short of a disgrace.  We should be given pristine 35mm source material, and we're not.  I suspect Fox wouldn't release the original camera negs from it's vaults without a substantial fee.  Anyway, season one of DANIEL BOONE isn't worth buying.  I haven't seen season two, when the show started filming in color, but I'm now afraid to look	0

219907	There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.	0
223901	I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.	0

244533	I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$	0
250033	In terms of both format and style, "Rent" - despite its superficially modernist tendencies - has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition.  Yet, it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production - which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters.  In more traditional musicals, the long stretches of spoken exposition between song-and-dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable, flesh-and-blood human beings.  This is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like "Phantom of the Opera," which seems a natural for this type of approach, but with material like "Rent," which is small in scale and intimate in scope, the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience.  I know that this play (and, perhaps now, even the movie) has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers "Rent" practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism, but to someone, like myself, coming cold to the work, "Rent" adds up to much less than the sum of its parts.	0
258968	Highly acclaimed. That, I knew. I watched the first 30 minutes, which is 1/4 of the movie, before I decided to hang it up. New lady moves into a conservative French town and opens a chocolate shop. This upsets the local church, even before she begins unleashing secret desires and so forth with her sinful chocolate. Okay. Can you really carry 2 hours with this single plot? Nope. This one's boring.	0

269080	This DVD skips quite a bit, making it hard to relax for what should be an enjoyable movie.  Also, the plastic covering on the DVD casewas torn a little bit when the security sticker was taken off.  I've never had a movie do that before.  I would think twice in the future before buying movies from Amazon.com	0

285749	As the other reviewers make clear, this is a disturbing film in that the college girl forced into prostitution ends up by developing feelings for the man who "ruined" her. So you may immediately assume that the director has a deeper comment to make beyond this trite observation.	0
290710	I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you	0

But the numbers that focus more on T & A than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me. I love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms, but ballroom dance is OTT enough ( if you've ever watched a competition) and doesn't need to be tarted up beyond recognition, the way it is here. Add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess	0
336738	Despite the talented cast this is perhaps the most ridiculous film ever.A goofy hippy copy laughs along the way trying to catch an eleven murder serial killer.This writer did Moonstruck, but this is Moonstink.Seeing Rod Steiger with this material is a tragedy.The case is a joke, the characters are impossibly lame, and the dialogue would gag a collie.This film is worth seeing only to gain appreciatiation for the value of screenwriters.No amount of acting talent can lift this turkey out of the Bankok privey.I just watched this film and at the conclusion I just sat there with my mouth open not believeing how bad the film was.Saradon, Keitel,KLine, Steiger, and Rickman....will try and forget this dog their entire lives.

354020	Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.	0
365660	I saw a glimpse of this movie earlier on HBO and was interested enough to purchase the DVD.  Too bad I didn't watch the movie first when it was free!  James Earl Jone's acting abilities were wasted on this movie, and I won't comment on the others.	0

392675	In 1973, director Nicholas Roeg took a Daphne Du Maurier story about a strained family situation, added a child in a red coat and some superlative direction, cast wonderful, talented actors such as Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and produced a seminal and classic piece of seventies horror, the unmissable "Don't Look Now".	0
398739	I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love	0
404430	The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical	0

424914	im a huge fan of writer Sean Mcginly, his classics include Venomous starring Treat williams and Sonic Impact with Ice-T.  Mcginly's films are the topic of discussion at film schools all across the world, he is a renowned talent and i have to say that i was appalled when i saw his latest film Two Days.  i think he should stick to writing as the film was virtually without direction and the cast (which included hacks like Paul Rudd) was not in the same league as superstars Traci Bingham and Ice-T who have graced some of his previous work.  Please Sean, stick to doing what you know best and stay away from the intellectual stuff, leave that to idiots like Capra, Wenders, Scorcese etc.  They are not in your league.	0
431669	Michael Moore can be really funny at times, but most people should not take this goofball too seriously.  About half way through 'The Big One', I turned it off because I did not find it the least bit funny and I didn't know where Moore was going.  What is the point of putting in a pointless sequence where he is talking to the guitar player of Cheap Trick?  This is not one of his better films	0
436471	My impression watching this turkey was that it had to be the work of a film student desperately trying to impress some artsy instructor. It's all style, no substance. I got the vague impression that there was a story somewhere in this mess of flashbacks, long slow camara pans across Stephen Dorff's very trendy and stylish haircut, and yelling matches with side characters whose only function seems to be to have someone to yell with. Despite the very art-house feel of it, the story is lost, the viewer is never quite sure if the "philosophy" of the main character is meant to be taken seriously, and the style is nothing we haven't seen done better other places.	0
439173	Whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people.  But all I see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around (few of them seem to have jobs) and party all day.  The main character (Sid) is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in Critical Theory in college (ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining Western Culture to pave the pathway for Marxism).  The film appeals to naive youth	0

The effects were decent, but most of the time I had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy 3D effects.  That was when I wasn't having to "look around" the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie.	0

508613	It's good to see that in his twilight years, old squinty eyes, Clint Eastwood is growing comfortable playing grouchy old dudes, because, well, he is a grouchy old dude. This movie is anemic from the beginning. Taken from a wonderful novel by Michael Connelly, Clint plays an old grouchy dude who's just gotten a new ticker because his last one gave out while chasing a serial killer. Run, run, run, THUD. Next, new ticker intact, Clint is hired to find the murderer of a cute black woman by her sister, another cute black woman. Oh, and CBW#2 plays the guilt card on Clint, because he's got his new ticker courtesy of CBW#1. So there's a little bit of investigative work, a little but of huffin' and a puffin', and finally Clint discovers who the serial killer is who was responsible for his first ticker giving out and the murder of the donor of his second ticker. Jeff Daniels plays a doofus that lives next door to Clint. What a stretch. Special warning: Clint takes off his shirt yet again in this film as he smooches on CBW#2. It must be in his contract or something. No one, and I mean, NO ONE wants to see saggy Clint with his shirt off. For a much, much better Clint movie, go rent "Unforgiven"	0

542052	Well, this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get, unfortunately: the female teenage protagonist (played by Witherspoon, whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here) acts masculine and heroic, the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant. At one ridiculous point, the girl runs around acting like a commando, a veritable one-gal army, blowing up the bad guys, while the boy hides in a cave sniveling. Later, when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal's backpack as they cross a desert, the gal snaps at him, Bella Abzug-style, and walks quickly ahead, leaving him in the dust. Clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here, and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men. Of course, in the real world, the result for such manly girls, once they become women, is that men do not choose them and they remain alone, and therefore become bitter--ironically and inevitably blaming men, of course. In this movie, the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy, masculine gal--but that's why they call them movies. When are these post-modern writers, artists, and other culture-shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism, they are touting something unnatural--men simply do not prefer masculine females. Men want someone to COMPLEMENT them, not COMPETE with them. Men crave FEMININITY in females, not FEMINISM. Wow, is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment! This poor teenage guy depicted in this movie, at least his character does progress a little bit: by the end of the movie, instead of craven and flippant, he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual-type with a wild-boy haircut, if that is even a step upward. But the plucky gal--she's still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside-down gender relations.	0

572718	This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out.	0

586929	Warner Bros is putting out a series of "Signature Collections".  They are nothing of the sort.  They are studio collections. The word signature implies the best of the best. A signature collection of Hitch's work would not include several of these titles. The rarely seen Foreign Correspondent and I Confess. The failed comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The experimental Dial M for Murder and The Wrong Man.  The middling Stage Fright. Only Strangers on a Train and North By Northwest are signature Hitchcock.  Where are Psycho,  Vertigo, The Birds, Rear Window, Notorious, Shadow of a Doubt, Rebecca, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes and, purhaps even, The Lodger?  A signature collection would include all or most of these titles with North by Northwest and Strangers on a Train.  Of course this would oblidge the different studios to cooperate with each other. God forbid. Warner Bros is developing a reputation for shortchanging and lying to its customers.  You're much better off buying your favorite Hitchcock titles individually new or used	0
593281	I found this movie to be almost unwatchable.  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you.

Altman can pull off such greats as "Mash" and  "Godsford Park" and then stink up the joint with this.  What's up with that	0

602683	Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.	0

Instead I will be focusing on the bonus features.  Not the Violent Femmes music video, because that too can be found on the Season 1 box set, but on the cast and crew interviews that make up the rest of the bonus features.  I love the interviews and the "in studio" voice recording re-enactments, but I *HATE* how EVERY piece of this great footage is ruined because someone thought it would be a great idea to cover up almost the entire screen with a bubble graphic frame.  You can only see the video through a small round part of the middle of your tv screen, and even then it isn't clear as there's a bubble "shine" over it.  I'd love for Paramount/Nick to include all of the original, non-bubblefied footage on the season 3 box set, even though most of the episodes are for seasons 1 and 2	0

I dislike Michael Moore as much as anybody, but the fellow that put this piece together needs to go back to film school. It's an amateurish, whining documentary made more for spite (and those 15 minutes we all want) than anything else. Getting called down by Michael Moore at a public event and then talking to some sympathetic people outside (people who probably just had nothing better to do on campus that night) doesn't prove that Michael Moore followers are all waffling malcontents, dude.

B000MQ54OO:neither_happy_nor_good,_and_likely_to_give_kids_nightmares:james_huff	What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets "The March of the Penguins" with some  of Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?)	0
B000EQ5TSI:a_movie_for_idiots:shawn_watson_"god_of_gods"	Many people criticized this movie for having no plot. Which is a result of many people criticizing the first for being too complex. There's just no pleasing some people but this movie could have made up for it by having some class or a formidable villain. Dougray Scott is pretty much one of the worst villains ever and a poor representation of Scottish actors.	0
B00029RT9O:nothing_to_write_home_about.:drew_vics	The review on the cover of the DVD reads "A snappy, sexy thriller..." I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.	0

079284355X:drama_about_domestic_terrorists:acute_observer	This film starts with an event based on a true crime. A talk radio show host in Denver was killed by an American Nazi. (This event inspired the "Talk Radio" play and film.) This film continues with scenes from a small town in a farming region. No mention of their economic status; are they losing dollars and population, small businesses, etc. Instead we see a small group of white racists who abduct a black man to hunt and kill him! This seems too exaggerated to believe. Federal agents are aware of this but don't want to act yet. Their agent is sent back to get more information. There are groups like that in some sparsely settled areas. The film doesn't explain what created them. It shows how some politicians try to use them for votes and contributions. No real names, of course.	0
B0009S4INS:just_okay_-_not_as_good_as_rockin'_wheels:new_yorker_in_san_diego	I was purchasing Rockin' Wheels (the one with the train and fire truck) for my son, and the Truck Adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together.  We borrowed the Rockin' Wheels DVD from the library and he liked it so much, I thought it would be good to have two different ones. However, the Truck Adventures is not as good, and my son doesn't even ask to watch it.  The songs are lame and so is the narrator.  Don't bother	0
B000NA28HU:horrible:dadof_4	great book, too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds.  i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie, almost didn't finish reading it.  they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film.  on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira's voice was right on, and while the movie character of Brom was fully wasted, jeremy irons did a fine job.  i look forward to starting the next book, but will skip the next movie.	0
B0002KQNZE:this_dvd_is_not_shaolin_idiot:mikey98223	This DVD is not Shaolin Idiot but an older film of Stephen Chow. It's really a film called "Look Out, Officer" that Stephen Chow made in 1990.

B0000A0DX8:did_these_people_have_no_shame?_at_all?:kristan_o._overstreet	Damn. There's nothing remarkable about the second item on this DVD; it's your standard European-made sexploitation film. "The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield," on the other hand, is reprehensible. It's a hodge-podge of vacation footage of Mansfield, clips from her movie project, and material entirely unrelated to Mansfield, linked only by the voiceover... and then, after an hour or so of light-hearted softcore buffoonery, the movie cuts to her death, spending the last twenty minutes obsessing on her husband and children and the large, mostly empty mansion she has left behind.	0
B0000541TL:urban_legends,_the_worst_movie...:garrett_yarbrough	I really enjoyed the first urban legends movie, but this one I was not impress by at all.  I wish I would have taken these reviews more seriously that I read before buying this dvd.  This was an awful cheapo urban legends movie.  Theres nothing here to come close of where the first urban legends was.  I see now theres a third urban legends movie out, im not sure if that ones good or bad, like this one.  If you have a couple of bucks to blow, go ahead and get this one.  If you seriously want a good atleast kinda scary movie, look else where.	0
B000JBXH8M:was_this_movie_made_for_the_lifetime_channel?:grinch_"the_mean_one"	If Lifetime switched from showing crappy dramas about wronged women to showing crappy horror flicks about wronged women this would one of them.

B000929ARI:wake_me_when_it's_over:cha_lau_"cha_lau"	Sure, this was heaped with loads and loads of popular acclaim by the critics, but the question you should be asking yourself is, will it appeal to the average person?  The simple answer here is a loud and resounding NO.  Here are the reasons:  1) Unless you're a well-bred blue blood who knows all about Edward II and loves Shakespeare, this is extremely hard to follow, not just because of the archaic olde English-speake, but also due to choppy production and editing which impedes the plot coherence. Result? If you're not lost you will soon will be, and worse yet, you won't care; 2) Don't be fooled by the lure of Annie Lennox-she is an itsy-bit of a bit player in the overall run of this "movie" and is, for all intents and purposes, inappropriately placed in the middle of it much like the effect of having an MTV commercial rammed in the middle of your programme; 3) Let's be clear about what you're getting for your 10-15 dollars:  It's not a movie at all, but an arty-pretentious stab at cheap play production with less cinematography than your average soap opera or home movie.  Further, the "period" is thematically juxtiposed with costumes of old and new, making one more likely to ponder whether their budget was short, not what cutty-edgy-trendy-theme-within-a-theme are they trying to promote.  Who knew such a tantillizing, heart-wrenching piece of history could be rendered so dull?	0
B000069HY7:a_big_disappointment:	This video was not animated like the classic Chuck Jones features such as "The Cat In The Hat" and "The Grinch".

We give this video a thumbs down	0

B000EHQ7HY:this_journey_of_self-discovery_goes_nowhere--and_not_fast_enough:k._harris_"film_aficionado"	I'm not sure what compelled me to seek out "Americano," written and directed by Kevin Noland.  It's not as if I was dying to check up on the career of Joshua Jackson, a star of TV's "Dawson's Creek."  Perhaps I was intrigued by Dennis Hopper's inclusion in such a small scale production--I mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar.  Here, however, the lure for him seems to have been his daughter Ruthanna, who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film.  Maybe it was international star Leonor Varela, a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in America.  Most likely, though, it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of Spain.  With great scenery, bull fights, Hemingway, hard drinking and partying, the Running of the Bulls--the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing.	0
B000FOQ1KY:decent,_but_the_weakest_"scary_movie":a._ng_"bruinfan2010"	While "Scary Movie 4" does work in getting out a couple of laughs, it certainly does not live up to the past three.  Many of the jokes that were used are redundant and frankly, are getting pretty old.  Although this movie had a lot of different material to work with such as The Grudge, Saw, and War of the Worlds, it misses the funny mark just by a bit.  Personally, I felt they could have done a LOT more in terms of parodying these films, particularily with The Grudge.  The writers should have taken more advantage of the content they had to spoof in order to have made this film a lot more funnier.  And really, was it necessary to spoof films such as Brokeback Mountain and Millionaire Dollar Baby, both of which are not horror films?	0
B00004TS0L:does_no_one_have_widescreen_tvs?:les_g._solomon	I find it almost incomprehensible in this more enlightened technological age that there are a very limited amount of your subscribers who are concerned about the appaling presentation of all but two of these movies and I also wonder as more and more older movies are being re-released enhanced for widescreen TVs that no one seems concerned that arguably the most classic of classical movie musicals remain in a truncated format that cannot be properly watched if one has a widescreen TV. These movies scream out for the widescreen, they were made with the ultimate technology of the time to be seen as wide and as broard as possible. Yet they remain stuck in a non anamorphic style that limits their enjoyment to anyone with a widescreen TV and, with one exception, all the people who have written about them dont seem to care. "Oklahoma", "Carousel", "South Pacific" and "King and I" need to be updated to 16.9 anamorphic widescreen (also preferably with some genuine extras and commentaries as well). Fox are years behind the rest of the movie studios in this regard and have only recently started to adapt their films for the format of the future (ie observe the two versions of "An Affair to Remember") of course, this is a major rip off, so anyone with a widescreen TV who has not bought these films --HOLD OFF, coz sooner or later they will get a proper release...How long? That is anybody's guess, but these postage stamp versions are an insult to anyone who knows anything of widscreen DVD technology ("Sound of Music" is fine and "State Fair" was made in non widescreen full screen format, an should be viewed with lines either side of the screen	0
0767833902:awful_film_barely_saved_by_a_couple_of_decent_acting_performances:trevor_cotton_"the_stick_up_kid_83"	The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.	0
B00008V5ZC:for_the_hardcore_50_cent_fans_only_(2_stars):norfeest_"yes_yes_y'all"	I don't consider myself a hardocre 50 Cent fan, but I went out and bought this after getting a preview of it in an issue of XXL.  It wasn't all that entertaining.  The documentary doesn't really tell the people anything that we don't already know.  We've seen all these videos before, but the video for &quot;Heat&quot; is straight wack.  The street version of that video is much better and somewhat funny.  The Show In Detroit isn't entertaining at all unless you just get a kick out of 10 people on stage chanting the words right along with 50 while making it impossible to understand a word that's being said.  The sessions @ AOL are straight pointless and why did we need an 8 Mile DVD trailer?  The DVD borders on corny, but the CD isn't that bad.  These are all songs that most diehard fans have already heard on his underground bootlegs, but I had not been able to find the &quot;8 Mile Road (G Unit Remix)&quot; ever since I lost my underground CD.  Lloyd Banks kills that track and that song is now contained on this CD / DVD release.  If you're a Young Buck fan, you should know that he's nowhere to be found on this release.  Overall, The New Breed isn't completely terrible, but it loses its novelty after one or two uses.  The three songs on the CD are decent, but you probably have them already.  I would only reccomend this to the die hard 50 Cent / G Unit fans	0
B0006H31MG:a_complete_waste_of_time:g._pfifer_"wizard"	My objection was the implication that the "stars" played a part in the film.  I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer.  It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary	0
B000069I1I:wretched!:derek_ruthven_"derek"	Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the "Dracula" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la "Dracula 2000." That alone should tell you my expectations.	0

B0001KNHTA:low_quality._:bernard_chapin_"ora_et_labora!"	This could have been an excellent documentary, but the makers of it decided to distort history rather than present it honestly. This is particularly true in the way it depicts Sparta as being some kind of Womyn's Power state which is absurd. Somewhat comically, the narrator enhances the story of Sparta by telling the story of its women which is quite trendy and also totally bogus. She tells us of laconic girls and their supposeed bi-sexuality. Hughes states that it would be a mistake to think of it as a "feminist wonderland," but that's exactly what is implied. I don't know how these other reviewers missed all the laughable politicizing such as: "Fighting wars is a soft option compared to going home to mother." Yeah right! Unless of course, husbands who shave their wives heads and leave after inseminating them count as amounting to the progressive ideal.  Pretending people of the past had the sensibilities we do is disgraceful. To many counter-culturalists, history has no value if it is not used for the purposes of advancing a political program. Unfortunately, that is precisely what we have here in this spoiled work. As for Bettany Hughes, I agree that she is quite attractive, but she is an awful narrator as she at times is downright giddy. Hers is not the type of personality that should be discussing Sparta--I'll take Victor Davis Hanson any day over her. I recommend that you skip this one and look for something which quotes actual historians.	0
B0009NSCUS:the_season_that_runied_chef!:j._summerford	The first two seasons of Chef! are absolutely brilliant and some of the most entertaining television one will ever watch. Season three, however, is virtually unwatchable - they changed director, changed from film to video tape, replaced many of the actors and the result is perhaps the fastest downfall of a great series in television history. I would avoid seasons three like the plague but do check out the first two seasons.	0
B00005JMET:turn_the_sound_off:m._s._butch	This movie is so dumb that it's as good with the sound off as with the sound on.  The only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads.   A plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an OK movie with a good script, but this script has no charm, no wit, no nothing	0
B000E8NRBM:ye_of_little_faith:k._maloney_"patsfan"	That's all I could think of when my family and I sat down to watch this movie together.  We had told the story to our children about the miraculous staircase built without nails in a small chapel in Santa Fe.  The story itself is so powerful and moving. Built in the 1870s, the chapel was nearly complete when it became apparent the choir loft stairs would not fit. The sisters' prayed a novena to St. Joseph and on the ninth day their prayers were answered when a mysterious carpenter arrived, built the "miraculous" staircase, and then disappeared without being paid. The staircase is a double helix with no visible support. It's 23 feet tall and makes two 360 degree spirals, and the wood used is not a known wood in any area near Santa Fee!	0
B000051YMS:great_movie,_bad_dvd:j._ferguson	Can't add much to the discussion about the movie, but wanted to say that this DVD listed does not contain a widescreen presentation of School Daze. It says it has both full screen and widescreen, but it doesnt	0
B00005S8KU:not_one_of_sellers'_best:irreverent_"irreverent"	Sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie, but Peter Sellers did many better films than this. "Dr. Strangelove" was the masterpiece.  "Being There" is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in Washington.  "The World of Henry Orient" (AT LAST on DVD!)is priceless but virtually unknown, with delicious performances from Sellers and especially his teenage tormentors.  Finally, the "Pink Panther" series is much better slapstick than "After the Fox," which has many famous, talented participants but is mostly silly, unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as Clouseau & Co. One irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations, as if we might not notice them otherwise. I agree with other reviewers that Victor Mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted, and Martin Balsam does okay with his stuff, too. When watching this film, I kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant -- I could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money	0
B000ASDFJ0:single_white_female_2.........uuuhhhhhh:michael_bolts	Holly played by Kristen Miller (She Spies, Man of the Year) has a nice career as a journalist with her friend played by Brooke Burns (Baywatch, Death of the Supermodels). The 2 of them fight over the owner of a restaurant named Zucas (I think thats close enough) runned by actor Tod Babcock (Guard Dogs, Poor White Trash). When Holly gets pissed off at her friend because she slept with Mr. Babcock she tries to find a new place to live and low and behold she finds a new shy roommate Tess, played by Allison Lange (The Hillside Strangler, Roswell). Holly becomes close to Tess and they seem to hit it off real well, until Holly finds out some things about Tess that makes her think that maybe this wasnt such a good idea. Well, in 1992, Jennifer Jason Leigh did this to Bridget Fonda and now they make a sequel about it, wow, they must of went threw tons of scripts just to get to this one. Pretty much the young girls on screen are eye candy and the acting is pretty bad plus the twists and thrills arent that great. This can go down with Basic Instinct 2....in the trash can or the skeet shoot, one of the two. Also starring Francois Giroday (Carpool Guy, Framed), Tracey McCall (Not Another Teen Movie, Second Degree), Rif Hutton (Osmosis Jones, Halfway Decent) and Kyme (School Daze, Geppetto).	0
B000I2J79U:heart_not_alive_on_my_xbox360:david_r._lopez	My HD-DVD also does not work on the 360 add on. I tried the press OK and everything else I could think of. This disk just freezes right after the production logo when it should be going to the menu. This is the only HD-DVD disk that I've had a problem with and I have about 10 of them. I didn't purchase the Chicago disk as I already have it and didn't think it was worth the HD purchase. I did purchase the Eagles HD-DVD and it is excellent. That one also has a trick to it. It defaults to a PCM stereo file so you have to triger it to the DTS ON mode and then it is amazing. I hope its true that microsoft is working on a patch for Heart. I saw them last year and they were fantastic. Not as good as the old days but neither am I. They still surprised me that they sounded sooo good.	0
B00005U1XU:one_step_above_truly_hideous.:michael_bruno_"m._bruno"	I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.	0

B0009OL7Z4:neither_romantic_nor_comedy:matt_fabian	The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater	0
B00005N90Y:nothing_wrong_with_movie,_but_dvd_fails.:sylvia_j._clay_"lightsrms"	This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.	0
B00005EBSF:i_still_hate_bergman!:the_jester	I have tried for years & years to get it. I still don't! This being the one Bergman film I seem never to get around to seeing, I made sure I saw it this time @ a Bergman retrospective @ my local art house theatre. Well @ least I sat thru it. During the show, no less than 5 people got up & just walked out. So I guess it's not just me! I personally found it to be mediocre at best. I don't get why folks think this is such an incredible film? The storyline is just so banal, as are the continuous close-ups of faces centered mid-screen. DATED TO SAY THE LEAST! I don't think it holds up-period! I have said it before & I still believe that if you want to see what Bergman was attempting thru-out his career, GO SEE "INTERIORS" BY WOODY ALLEN! He does Bergman BETTER THAN Bergman! And don't even get me started on Liv Ulman---ugh!!!!!	0
B00008RV0B:rent_it_first!!:jsranchmn_"susan"	A dismal disappointment. I think you should rent it and find out for yourself before you actually own a copy. When I see the high ratings, I wonder if people have some investment in the selling of this product. The original Lonesome Dove mini series was unbelievably well done. A complete multifaceted joy. I was so excited when I saw there was a sequel and the joy of Lonesome Dove would continue. Well it didn't and you can read why in more depth in other low ratings	0

B000BU0BB2:glad_i_only_paid_$4.86_for_this_dvd:tina_h_"tina"	The first time I put this workout DVD on, I expected to see exercises designed for abs, buns and thighs.  What I actually saw was an easier version of the kickboxing DVD.  I kept going, thinking it would get to the abs, buns and thighs, but it never did!  The other huge problem with this video is that half of it is filmed from the waist up, or headshots only, so when you are being introduced to a new step in the routine, you can't even learn it, because you cannot see the instructors legs or feet.  Also very irritating how there are interruptions in filming, picking up on a different beat to where it left off.  All in all an awful purchase and not even worth the $4.86 paid.  I turned it off halfway through the second workout and put Billy Blanks TaeBo on instead.  MUCH BETTER!!!	0

B000BNX4MW:a_waste_of_talent:kardius	With a good script and a director better suited to the material (I've read Pedro Almodovar expressed interest in adapting the novel and Jonathan Demme was originally attached to direct), Asylum could have been a superb exploration of romantic obsession and a great showcase for star Natasha Richardson.  Unfortunately, the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms... a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession.	0

B000M06KJ8:terrible!:aj	If you've read the book this movies is EXTREMELY loosely based on, you will understand why the movie is so horrid. It's beautiful to look at, but that is all. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a Queen of France. This movie completely ignores the Revolution, Marie Antoinette's arrest, and murder. In short, the movie ignores anything that is not pretty, girlish, and light.	0
B000067G10:don't_bother_buying_this_dvd:w._male	I purchased Dick Cavett's John Lennon and Yoko Ono interview and it was great. It was about an hour and a half of interview and performance material. I gained new insight about John and Yoko. So I bought Cavett's interview of Jimi Hendrix expecting something similar. The 15 minutes of glib questions by Cavett produced nothing new about Hendrix. Included in the DVD are a few minutes of Jimi playing at Woodstock. The rest of the DVD is mediocre at best.	0
B000H5U68Y:terrible_beyond_imagination:martin_a_hogan_"marty_from_sf"	With the phenomenal success of "The Poseidon Adventure", the first disaster movie of its kind, the sequel was sure to be a hit.  Not so.  A plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great.  Having a leading lady (Sally Fields) fresh from an Oscar win and a few veteran actors (Michael Caine, Karl Malden), might also sound promising.  Unfortunately, the magic of the set production of the original is not even close.  Instead of upside ballrooms, barber shops, kitchens and bathrooms, the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes.  The rest of the cast is comprised of television actors, who are as wooden as the script.  There's no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous, you won't even laugh in disbelief.  Irwin Allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel.  Considering the original, that's a terrible shame	0
B00007ELEZ:inconsistent_and_politically_correct:	The first half of this movie starts out promising; the 2nd half is not so good.	0
B0009MAOBO:more_like_boring-broly:	I am a fan of DBZ, I am a fan of Goten, I think Hercule is funny and I think #18 is hot. Yet this movie sucked! It was missing what makes DBZ so great: lots of action and a great plot. Broly is overused and this completely ruins him. Like most DBZ movies, it doesn't fit into the timeline. If we worked it in, then Goten and Trunks would only be a matter of hours away from using the Fusion technique. Had this movie taken place after then, the fight would be a lot more interesting.	0
B0002J5004:not_one_of_the_best,_like_the_last_reviewer_said...:brandy_wortham	I like almost all of Lifetime's movies and love tuning in to watch but this was certainly not one of the best. The name bring "obsessed" was not what it should have been called, the lady was dreaming and had an illness. This movie had a horrible twist which made the ending bad and hard to follow and understand the whole way through, this movie was not what I had expected. As I said I like almost all of Lifetime Original Movies but I definitely wan't be watching this one again.	0
B000A1OFYQ:awful!:bob_wren_"rob9901"	I resent the comment of the reviewer who said this is the worst film in 100 years.  I make it 200.  The other reviewers have noted the idiotic factual mistakes that makes this such a howler.  I just loved the U.S Air Force personnel with Scottish and English accents.  They must have overrun the $500 budget at that point.	0

B000K2UGXO:weak_story,_an_all_star_cast,_a_real_waste_of_time.:ranjan_chari_"ranjan_chari"	With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it	0
B000JF5TXO:confused_by_this_'classic':megzi	I am convinced you have to be one of three things to enjoy this film: male, born before 1935, or a huge Monroe fan smitten with anything she ever put out. Marilyn is so annoying in this I wanted to smack her, and Tom Ewell's character is equally a jerk. I am not sure why this movie was supposed to be funny. Is adultery funny? Not really. I don't mean to sound so conservative, in fact I'm quite the opposite, I'm pretty liberal, which may be why this movie bothered me so much. It is very sexist and dated and Monroe's usual portray of the harmless, stupid, breathy blonde bimbo so eager to please isn't very empowering to young women. The character she portrays has no name, is simply titled 'The Girl' a female puppet manufactured for pleasure. The jokes are dated and fall flat, no longer funny to modern society. I think 'The Seven Year Itch' is one of the most overrated 'classics' ever but what can I say, my 84 year-old grandmother enjoyed it. Maybe she was just nostalgic for the '50s. A much better Monroe comedy is 'Some Like It Hot' where she is less annoying and the humor still resonates to this day	0
B00004YA6T:the_end_of_a_great_show_begins.:kenneth_j._devine	THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.	0
B000KX0IMM:bad_screenplay,_bad_acting,_directing,_editing,_nothing_but_bad:none_whatsoever_"don't_waste_your_time_to_comment"	ridiculous plot, one dimensional cardboard-like acting (especially leon lai's rigid dead-like-fish-out-of-water performance), incoherent dialogs, horrible editing and directing, every thing is so bad if compares it to the first one. the second one has already turned bad but not as bad as this 3rd increment. the screen writers were obsessed with abnormal twists of the plots and tried to twist every section of the scenario to the extreme but unfortunately almost messed up the logic flow of a storyline. nothing deep but shallow all the way. just like a magician overplayed his black magic and suddenly found himself exposed completed without white gloves, long sleeves, and black cloak, even the white pigeons turned out to be dead. nothing could be hidden up in his sleeves or the tall hat. nothing at all. curtain call, drop it sooner than later.	0
B000EHSV96:should_be_on_the_list_of_worst_movies_of_all_time:stefan_riddle_"dutch"	I would give this -5 stars.  After sitting through about 20 minutes, I gave up on seeing anything remotely entertaining	0
6305120382:your_basic_waste_of_time:david_levine	This might be the perfect flick for a fourteen year-old who aspires to be a mass murderer. There is little to recommend it apart from the technical perfection of some of the cinematography and the staging of the scenes of mass destruction of people and property. Even these scenes have none of the balletic grace of Tarantino's "Kill Bill" films, his salute to the genre, or "Reservoir Dogs," which has a mystery at its core and some fine acting and dialogue that temper the violence.	0
B00005OW0D:read_the_book_instead:dana_cain_"dana"	20 minutes into this movie I was disgusted by the terrible acting and the complete disregard for the book on which is it supposedly based. The actress playing Cleopatra protrays her as petulent, spoiled and immature, whereas in the book one saw Cleopatra as highly astute, regal, and concerned first about her country and its people. In the movie she handed Egypt to Ceasar eagerly, whereas in the book she refused to surrender anything to Rome. Likewise, Dalton portrays Ceasar as a complete ****.	0

B0000AE7CE:hands_down_the_worst_of_the_series_(that_has_to_do_with_michael).:squash_'n'_squeak_"the_silencing_machine"	Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3	0
B0000CNY6Y:confused:j._effinger	I like Japanese films, and really wanted to like this one. However I must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot. Now I have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day. If that is true I might give it a higher rating. As of now however, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense	0
B000BYRCEW:not_funny:zach_everson	The no-name comedians at the beginning were funny, Bea Arthur killed, and the dumpy lady at the end who kept talking about how African-Americans used to dig her backside but don't any longer was funny. Courtney Love's antics were amusing but grew tiresome. The rest of the roast was horrible. Telling Tommy Lee that his genitals are the envy of barnyard animals is not an insult. And, after it's repeated ad nauseum, it's not funny either.	0
B00000INVJ:great_movie_-_worst_dvd_transfer_ever:	Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases.....	0
B00083FZEU:steven_seagal_is_to_martial_arts_what_millie_vanillie_was_to_music:james_bond_007_"movie_collector"	The only reason I gave this movie a star was because there is no Zero star option. Where does Seagal continue to get backing for his movies - the last 8 (or 10?) have all been awful. His last good release was Under Seige. I only wish my 401K grew as fast as his waistline. Submeged is bad - no suprise there, it will be the last movie of his I watch, I just can't take it any more. Submerged? Must be a reference to his movie career which went under about a decade ago	0

B0006Z2NE0:i'll_watch_it_again.:coronet_blue	I agree that this is technically an excellent film.  But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind.  Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character.  His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism.  But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.	0

B0001Z37J0:niteinco:nite_in_co	Every Lakers fan I've ever met lives in the past sadly now.  To them, the clock stopped when Kareem and Magic hung up the shoes [and we know why Magic had to leave].

0767026128:money_and_time_wasted:dickcissel	This version, bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story, but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story.

B00005O5AZ:substitute_3_review:crazy_jim	Second straight-to-video sequel to 1995's &quot;The Substitute&quot; has part-time mercenary, part-time substitute teacher Treat Williams taking over for a college professor who was brutally beaten by her juiced-up jock students. Williams and his new team of operatives are out to uncover a steroid scandal linking the university's football team to a local Mafia goon. Pretty good in a dumb Saturday afternoon movie type of way but the third act is more cheesy and full of holes then... well, Swiss cheese, I guess	0
B00023TG6O:not_impressed:scott_l._markworth_"grounder"	By the title I would be led to believe that there is more than one George story. There is one George and a few others, one of which scares my 2 1/2 year old. I thought the stories would be animated. However, some (including George) are pictures from a story book. We love to read books, but videos should be more than photos of a story book. Would not recommend this	0
B00022XE4A:a_huge_disappointment:scodapfre_"scodapfre"	This one was really boring.  Only buy this if you are trying to collect all the Scooby DVDs or if you have a very young child.  Very young children might find this mildly entertaining.  This is not a movie for older kids/teenagers/adults who are fans of Scooby Doo.  I loved Scooby Doo: Zombie Island, Witch's Ghost, Alien Invaders, Cyberchase, and Legend of the Vampire.  If you want to get a good Scooby Doo DVD get those instead.  Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was a huge disappointment too, but this was actually even worse.	0
B00004RYCP:not_my_batman:adam_soviak_"kal-el"	Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:-	0
B000EAT232:cuby_gets_dirty:michael_butts	The strange and baffling career of Cuba Gooding takes another dive in this attempt to mirror the success of Denzel's TRAINING DAY.  Unfortunately, Cuba's not Denzel and this movie is way below the quality of DAY.  Filled with enough foul language to fill the Pacific Ocean, the movie attempts to be artsy but is merely another bad cop movie, filled with bad cops---where's the good ones?  Clifton Collins Jr., so good in CAPOTE, is wasted in the role of the apparently honest partner of Cuba who is going to testify in Internal Affairs regarding the killing of an innocent bystander during a drug bust.  All though this Cuba swaggers like a rap star and Collins has to try and act tough with him.  There's an unusual twist in the end and a very long russian roulette sequence that do nothing to redeem this disappointing film	0
B000BYY0UQ:one_word:_sad:d._mcilwain	Having just read the book (most highly recommended) I decided to treat myself to the movie. I could have cried. While I did not expect the movie to contain everything from the book, I was sadly dissapointed to see that it totally changed the plot around.	0
1558908846:dreddful_review:joseph_v._certeza_"vulcan8630"	One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately "Judge Dredd"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for "Future Shock" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  "Dredd" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much!	0

B000060MUD:effective...but_boring!:kelly_nixon	I've owned this workout for about three years.  I do it on occasion if I feel like I need to slap my legs in to shape.  It does a great job of increasing muscle stamina in the lower body.  However, I have to force myself to do this video.  The 35 minute warm-up is mundane and uninspired.  By the time I finish doing the same repetitions on the same leg for 15 minutes I hardly feel like doing the whole process again for the other leg.  I also find the way the instructions are given and the background music to be extremely irritating.  In order for me to get through the video I have to put on some different music and turn the TV down until I can just barely hear the instructor's voice to know I'm keeping up with the video. In my opinion this video is more of a test of patience than a real yoga workout experience.	0
B000HRLWWQ:awful_comedic_western:cory_d._slipman	What an incredible waste of acting talent "There Was a Crooked Man" turned out to be.  Director Joseph Mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as "All About Eve" and "The Barefoot Contessa" should be embarrassed by this bomb.	0
B000063URH:attack_of_the_killer_rats!:a._santona_"indie_filmmaker"	This movie has the feel of a late-night monster fest hosted by Svengoolie or Elvira. I had no idea what this was about when I started watching it, but by the end, I wished I would have skipped it entirely. The story starts off well, with murders happening in an old factory by some mysterious monster (that you don't see at first). From there it goes downhill, it felt like a low-rent 'Pet Sematary'. I have never read the short story that this was based off of, but I'm sure that King made his scarier than this movie could ever be. The best acting in the movie comes from Brad Dourif, best known for his performance as Billy Bibbit in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' and the voice of Chucky the killer doll from 'Child's Play', as an exterminator	0
B0000897EG:poor_casting,_predictable_story:a._vegan	Firstly I must say how much I dislike Jennifer Lopez so attempting to watch this movie has been a struggle since it was first released however I decided to brave it out for the sake of Ralph Fiennes.  Lopez plays a maid who falls for a guy who has loads of money (Fiennes, who is miscast, really) He thinks she is a guest in the hotel, she plays along. So she lies about herself for the rest of the movie and when all is revealed, it comes to a ridiculous ending.  There's not much else to say to this cinderella movie, except maybe that it's not funny. Lopez isn't a great actress, she and Fienness have about as much chemistry as a toothbrush in a toiletbowl	0
B0000B3B95:one_of_the_worst_movies_i've_ever_seen.:angel	Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!	0
B0009Y272Q:i_agree...it's_disappointing.:joel_s._peters	This DVD is nothing more than a recycling of 3 previous episodes of the show.  For a "best of" volume, I expected much shorter segments from many more episodes that actually did contain what the DVD case advertises, namely "the best of" and the "scariest moments."  In my opinion, this volume fails to deliver what it promises.  I am definitely a fan of the series, and I know there are much better moments it has to offer.  About the only thing you can really expect to enjoy on this DVD are some fairly decent examples of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon).  Even though the DVD is fairly inexpensive, I don't think it's worth the cost	0

0790749858:sickening:l._sonnenberg	My daughter was shown this movie in her public school classroom several times while she was in grade school. It wasn't until years later that I saw it, and I was HORRIFIED!!! This was a movie aimed at children??? What does a children's movie need a sexy bunny for? The lead female character was a very sexy bunny wearing skimpy clothing and "strutting her stuff" on the basketball court in a very provocative manner, until the male characters were panting, drooling, and clawing their way after her like a bunch of  sick, depraved perverts. This scene was highly innapropriate for children, and is NOT the idea of womanhood that should be shown to boys or girls. Not only that, the idea was put forward that only a fortune teller with a crystal ball was able to discern the truth about what happened to the players abilities. This movie should be kept far, far away from children, and was truly deserving of zero stars	0
B0000E6XIZ:1_star_for_anna's_&quot;talents&quot;:brian_e._holloway_"b"	Dare I need tell you how greatly this softcore, action thriller sucks?  Ok.  You might think there are two reasons (besides those two) to rent this: Nudity and Hilariously bad acting.  Well, there is nudity, but not as much as you think.  If you're getting it for Anna's naked flesh, be prepared to be more acquainted with your fast forward button.  She's nude, don't get me wrong, in the shower, in the bed, etc., but after that first scene, she is clothed and trying to act for a loooong time before the next scene.  Her &quot;acting&quot; is probably good if you compare to how she acts on her TV show.  she at least doesn't seem stoned. There is a plot that involves...just kidding, I have no idea!  There are some actual actors and a Travolta sibling playing your typical mobsters found in these movies.  The movie only still exists because of Anna being naked in it and there is nowhere near enough of it to make &quot;To the Limit&quot; more than a free rental, if that. I should mention that this is a review for the R rated version.  I don't know if there is an unrated version, but it would have to be better than this.  For more nudity, bad acting, and a less coherent Anna, go rent &quot;Skyscraper&quot;	0

6305371571:don't_be_fooled:"mr_dont_play"	I have watched this movie along with many other Jet Li films. To be very honest with you this movie is one that you can keep out of your collection. I was so caught up in the title that I really was expecting much more from the film. But I was very disappointed to say the least. The movie takes place in the early eighties. When Gangs dressed in leather with chains, carrying spray paint and break danced occasionally. This was not the type of movie that I was expecting Jet Li to be in. If you want some real action packed Jet Li pick up the Contract Killer which will give you alot more for your money TRUST ME you want be disappointed	0
B000228SIM:koch_strikes_again._this_dvd_is_the_r_rated_version.:david	Once again, Koch, for reasons that I cannot possibly fathom, assumed that people would enjoy this movie more if the brilliant story and dialog weren't being constantly interrupted by those annoying sex scenes.

B000AM67AU:great_band,_terrible_dvd:steven_thomson	First of all, who was the spastic genius who decided that concert films had to change camera angles every five seconds?

B000050HEP:pretty_forgettable:harry_truman_yves	I bought this for the Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacy documentaries, like I imagine you might. I'm not disappointed really, I don't regret buying it in any sense, it's just that this DVD isn't very good at all. It doesn't attempt to make any insight, which isn't something I particularly care for anyway. What each documentary offers is a limited and quite dated view of the serial killers. I can't imagine anyone learning something they didn't already know from them. It's mostly told through pictures when it seems there's option to use video. The Dahmer documentary, made in 1993, doesn't feature anything of interest. There's no interview with his father or anything, just a voice telling a story over pictures we've all seen before, with occassional clips of victims' families in court. The Gacy one, made in '96, is the same. There's also a program, made in 1997,on criminal profiling. This look at three farely well known killers whose capture supports profiling. It's told often with video rather then photos, which is good, but still they're somewhat boring subjects. The Criminal Profiler, Dahmer, and Gacy are all episodes from the A&amp;E series Investigative Reports, if you didn't realise. The last program is on Charles Manson. It's quite different from the others on the disc. Made in 1997, it originally aired on television as Biography: Charles Manson: Journey Into Evil. I don't with have any interest in Manson, but I guess it's ok. It features significant interviews with Manson and main female members of the Family. All programs run for about one hour or more. I wouldn't reccomend any of them, none are good at all. I might even describe them as terrible, considering what else is out there	0
B00009OWJT:a_'difficult'_movie;_unfortunately,_it_ain't_very_good_either:dave_"missing_person"	It's always a shame to see a really talented actor/ actress star in a dud of a movie, but that's exactly what happened to Jodie Foster with 1979's "Foxes".  Directed by Adrian Lyne, who would later go on to direct the notorious "Fatal Attraction", "Foxes" is a cheap, lame-brained attempt at a gritty look into the dark side of teenage life.  The movie suffers from a painful lack of character development and goes in a seemingly incoherent fashion from one scene to another, making it hard to stay focused.  The movie isn't a TOTAL waste--a few dramatic scenes do at least catch your attention; and Jodie Foster, still under 18 when this was filmed, has a real charisma about her despite the fact that she isn't given much to work with.  Plus, that piano melody of Donna Summer's "On The Radio" which crops up throughout adds a nice melancholy feel.  Overall though, "Foxes" really is pretty lousy and can't be given much of a recommendation	0
B000ARFPPI:i_want_my_2_hours_back:j._kern_"jkern35"	Well, i just got done watching this movie and actually went out of my way to write this review.  Truthfully, i didn't catch the last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around the house and could  care less about what happend.	0
B000F5IA7A:bluh:d._moore_"dave657657"	Very short game, took about 2 hours to finish it (took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it, because as always their "system is unavailable, please try again later" - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable, and definately it will be the last steaming product I buy).	0
B00000K3TK:let's_be_honest_...:sci-fi_guy	This is not a good film.  I wanted to like it because I love South Park and I think that Trey Parker and Matt Stone are comedic geniuses.  While it shows brief glimpses of some of their future brilliance, overall it's just not very funny.  I think I laughed twice during the whole film.  Watch it to see the South Park guys "before they were stars", but don't expect much	0
6911	I covered a similar theme in my international relations MA - whilst any programme made for TV has to be reasonable breif on the subject, I found this to be a very well argued and produced programme.	1

24910	"Ils se marirent et eurent beaucoup d'enfants" ("Happily Ever After") is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love, lust, marriage, infidelity, and the single life.  Writer/Director/Actor Yvan Attal has come up with a winner, an entertaining, funny, and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering.	1
35680	We purchased this DVD because we really need to work with our son on his reading and it's a great supplement to reading books.  He loves this DVD and we love the variety in it's approach.  We didn't realize until we watched it with our kids that so much of what we viewed as children really stuck with us through the years	1
37396	Back in the 1980s, back before every television show was "CSI: City Of Your Choice" and "Law & Order: Crime Division of Your Choice," there was a veritable plethora of well-written, clever, hour-long mystery programmes - "Magnum P.I.," "Murder, She Wrote," "Moonlighting," "Hart to Hart," "The A-Team," to name just a few.  And this was when most people still only had three commercial networks to choose from (not counting PBS).  But far and away, the best of these mystery shows (and perhaps the most under-rated) was "Remington Steele," in which Pierce Brosnan (with second billing!) and Stephanie Zimbalist fought crime with style, dash, wit, comedy, and a bit of romance.  The series, with its rat-a-tat dialogue, vaguely Deco feel (a slight Deco revival was the only good thing about `80s dcor), and occasional zaniness, at times harkens back to the wonderful Preston Sturges-esque screwball comedies of the 1930s and `40s.  Indeed, it's clear from the moment that Brosnan appears on the screen in episode one of season one that not only did he have the star power of Classic Hollywood, but he was a Cary Grant for our times; devastatingly handsome in dapper Saville Row suits with an accent as charming and distinctive as Grant's.  (As an aside, it's also clear that Brosnan was born to play James Bond - truly, who was surprised that he was bestowed with the honor, albeit belatedly?  We won't get into the infamous Season Five vs. Bond debacle.)	1
51650	My son was over 2 before we introduced BE videos.  There are definitely those which cater to the younger baby with lots of random images, but this one is great in that it has puppet shows with a little plot, as well as discrete integrated units for each of the seasons.  Unlike some of the other BE's with random visuals, here the visuals truly support the learning objective desired.  Concur with other reviewers as well that this is the most robust BE video in Bonus Features. It has both puppet shows and another short learning video of all the seasons.	1
59566	2 Fast 2 Furious is one of those sequels that comes around every so often that doesn't require you to have seen the original. I saw this movie for the first time not too long after it came out, and having never seen the original, I thought I would be lost and wouldn't enjoy myself as much as other people, but on the contrary - I left the experience much happier than when I came in.	1
64551	saw the trailer online and knew I'd love it on dvd	1
66205	I really liked this film.  Before Michael Moore became a liberal celebrity, he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker.  This film was a major underground hit at the time, and it still is excellent today.  You really feel for the people who lose their jobs, and you're infuriated by the callous indifference of Roger Smith and the management of General Motors.  I really liked the segment where Flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the Midwest.  It consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a Hilton in downtown Flint, and opening up a theme park called Auto World.  It justs smacks of desperation and stupidity; it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time.  Instead of giving these people really good jobs again, they come up with this idiotic scheme, which ended up in disaster (both the Hilton and Auto World closed within a year).  Moore in recent years has become a "political celebrity", in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in America.  It's not just Moore doing it; right wingers like Hannity and Coulter have been doing it too.  They all got books; some of them got films; some of them have radio shows.  A lot of them aren't really interested in changing anything, as it might interfere with their livelihoods.  I don't know if Moore is like that or not.  But this is still a potent, darkly funny film about real class warfare, and the dismantling of the working class in America.	1
70713	This is a great movie that everyone should see. I'm a Conservative and so are all of my friends and they love this movie. We don't see this movies as a "Republicans are Bad movie" thats dumb. This movie is just what a movie should be, funny and entertaining. We all LOVE the songs because they are not only great, but true too	1
76839	I recently had a baby boy, and felt a &quot;little&quot; out of shape after having him(HA!)I did a search on amazon and found this video. I got it in 3 days, and began right away. My son works out with me every day, and I couldn't be happier! We both have fun doing the exercises which work my whole body, and I use him for the weights!I am also learning about my baby's development from the video. It's educational and rewarding. Thanks MBBB	1
80647	I really enjoyed this DVD-and all of the combos were doable with great breakdowns.	1
91273	This is my favorite movie. I like it all: screenplay, director, actors, etc. Believe it brilliant	1
98925	I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT!	1
104931	This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done.	1
108714	Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth..	1
119611	It's as good if not better than Volume 1 of Cartoons That Time Forgot. The episodes are a bit more wierd in this volume. Hope there will be a Volume 3 coming out soon	1
125027	THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS is Wes Anderson's third major motion picture.  The movie revolves around a rich, but extremely eccentric man name Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman).  Royal and his wife Etheline (Angelica Huston) had three children:  Chas (Ben Stiller), Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Richie (Luke Wilson).  In the 1970s the Tenenbaums were one of America's premier families:  Margot was a famous playwright, Richie was a junior tennis champion who later won three consecutive U.S. Nationals, and Chas started his first real estate business at an early age earning himself his first million dollars before he was thirteen.  That was almost thirty years ago and the Tenenbaums have largely been forgotten.  Betrayal, failure, and disaster have haunted the family and the laurels of their youthful days have withered and died.  What's worse is that Royal's children and wife blame him for all their failures.  Royal senses that his time is Earth is waning and he wishes to set things right.  With the assistance of his faithful servant and lifelong friend, Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), Royal sets into motion a plan to redeem himself in his family's eyes.	1
130578	This film is one of my all time favorites. I think it's because these kids remind me of my friends and I as kids - riding our  bikes, going on little adventures, etc. The cast is absolutely perfect. Wil Wheaton was the best crying kid of all time - with the exception of Ricky Schroeder in The Champ. LOL. River Phoenix was excellent in this film, which is an adaptation of a Stephen King short story. Part road film, part coming of age tale, all the elements are here to tug at your heart strings.	1
135207	The folks at PBS deserve the gratitude of photography teachers and students everywhere. Taking on subject matter as impossibly broad as photography in 20th Century America? This documentary covers-- sometimes comprehensively, sometimes briefly-- virtually every important topic germane to the field of study, from Pictorialism to Straight Photography, from fashion to the scientific. Along the way, we are introduced (or reintroduced) to what has been the medium's most important uses: journalism and documentary. "A Century of Images" is as instructive for the novice as it may be reaffirming to those already familiar with much of the material. Underlying a wealth of historical examples and anecdotes are the two twin themes that raise this effort above the mundane: concern over the ethical issues photographs present, and the effects of mechanically produced images in the post-industrial age on the psyche of our nation. These themes manifest themselves in ways that are often revelatory and moving. One memorable example: the way Edward Curtis's images of Native Americans are placed into context by a woman who appreciates them, yet yearns for more images that show her people the way they "really were." Sections on war photography cover WWI, WWII, Vietnam and the Gulf War with compassion, and work as excellent visual aids to discussions on todays situation in Iraq. Another bonus: the section on the transition to a digital age has not yet outlived its usefulness.	1
140668	Very good film, hard hitting, emotional and I'm sure some aspects really do happen (although I have yet to witness much of it since I've been in LA	1
145643	One of the movies I like to watch over and over.  Jessica Tandy played a great character in this movie.  My order came real quick	1
151594	(4.5/5 stars)  Exceptional envisioning of the Batman comic book by Tim Burton. Michael Keaton brings an understated disaffection in the role of the billionaire with a disturbed soul and dual personality. Contrast this with the unbridled mania of the character in "Batman Begins;" both are equally effective, though one style over the other will likely appeal to you. Is there any topping Jack Nicholson in his role as Jack Napier / The Joker? Only he can pull off such an exaggerated performance and have it be so fun without ruining a movie. Even though his role is suitably funny, there is a little too much humor overall in the movie. Robert Wuhl's character is especially unnecessarily comical. Also, while Danny Elfman's score is duly heroic and compelling, the music by Prince just doesn't mesh well and is probably not the best choice. Nonetheless, the visuals are stunning, the action is taut and the film vastly entertaining. It is a testament to the film's influence that numerous comic book movies have subsequently used Danny Elman scores (including rival Marvel's "Spider-Man") and molded black rubber suits, though this film also owes much to 1978's "Superman" with its realistic approach and A-list villains. Great stuff.	1
155434	The funny thing about this movie is that I read negative reviews here, and rather agree with what they assert: that the plots and some of the characters are not very "evolved" due to time. If you disect the movie, yes this is *true.*	1
160489	this comedy, like Click has a funny side to it and then switches to a darker side half way through. the characters in this film can be hated at points, especially Michael Douglas' and Matt Dillon's but there is a lighter side! Owen Wilson is very likeable as Dupree, an unemployed party guy who is in need of love and a good paying job. the cast is fine and one of the strength's in this film! however, I think it gets too serious at points. this is supposed to be a comedy after all. I wouldn't buy it but it is certainly worth renting	1
168785	The military courtroom drama,"A Few Good Men" is one of those films, that through endless cable showings seems to have taken a life of it's own. But even with countless viewings it retains it's emotional power and speaks to us about issues, that have become more important than ever. In the film we meet Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) a young successful, military lawyer, who is considered so slick at plea bargaining out cases, that supposably he's "never even seen the inside of a courtroom". He is assigned the cases of PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Cpl. Harold Dawson (Wolgang Bodison). They are accused of murder and a host of other charges, when at the Guantanamo Bay military base they performed a "Code Red" (an illegal form of discipline within a military unit) on Pvt. William Sandiago, which unintentionally resulted in his death. While the two accused Marines admit they did the "Code Red", both claim they were under orders to do so by their superiors, which includes Base Commander, Col. Nathan Jessup (a brillaint Jack Nicholson) a powerful, highly decorated officer, who is being groomed for one of the top slots in the military command. With both time running out and a lack of legal evidence, Kaffee must get to the bottom of a conspiracy and present his case, even if it means putting his own career in jeopardy. Through a brilliant script (based on the play by Aaron Sorkin), Rob Reiner's steady direction and the cast's dynamic performances this film looks at the meaning of highly held military principles such as "code, honor & discipline". Should a soldier always follow orders no matter what? Whats' more important our ethics & principles (on which this country was founded) or our need for security? Is Col. Jessup right? Can we not "handle the truth"? It's hard to believe, that this film was made way back in 1992. In this post 9/11, post Abu Grebbe world, where our country is on a war footing the questions, that the film seeks to address have become more profound and important than ever. The film is filled with great performances. While I am not normally a huge Tom Cruise fan, I have to admit, that Cruise does a wonderful job as the young conflicted lawyer. The same goes for the great supporting cast which includes good acting turns from Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland. But what really propels and turns this film into a classic is the brilliant, dynamic performance, that comes from Jack  Nicholson. When Cruise puts Nicholson on the courtroom stand and starts pointly egging him on, you just watch in awe as Nicholson just continually builds the character's palpable anger, until he just boils over and explodes in the now infamous "You Can't Handle the Truth" speech. Even though the speech and Nicholson's performance has been endlessly quoated & parodied, when you put it in the context of this movie it still has so much power and resonance. If you are interested in seeing a well made, movie courtroom drama, that is both thought provoking and entertaining then I highly recommend "A Few Good Men"	1
176749	Despite the chintzy, unconvincing facial hair (Jeff Daniels' being the exception); Martin Sheen's too-gentlemanly interpretation of Gen. Lee's accent (and his beard); obvious & saccharine soliloquies about the higher purpose for fighting the war; generalized (and largely inaccurate) interpretations of the underlying history of the war; and hopelessly, ridiculously, wildly off-the-mark attempts atNew England accents, the film still works.	1
180265	I was sooooooooo excited to see that this movie had been released, and I was not disappointed.  The dancing was magnificent, and it was amazing to see Patrick & Lisa together.	1
184933	I loved the first one and I think, with the logic and plot of the first one, this follows through. We knew they changed the world, and in this sequel we see that. The actors do a good, since the lead characters are suppose to be, let's say less intelligent, but nice. I think this movie and the 1st one are classics. I like the grim reaper, his atitude during the movie, and the fact the he is the comic relief (okay so most of the movie is comic relief) Even if they are fun to watch to laugh at, it is worth it to watch	1
196736	If you liked "Raise the Red Lantern" or "The Last Emperor",this is a perfect movie.Gong Li,who played a concubine fighting with others for her husband's affection now plays a woman who realizes another man loves her husband.	1

219022	Eric Stoltz give's a kick ass performance here!!	1
232801	Amazon.com made sure I received my items in time.  Above receiving the movie in excellent condition, the movie is entertaining and reminds you what real acting is.	1
243972	This box set is worth every penny!	1
249204	Really does not get the film noir credit it deserves (probably from its title with the uninformed film watcher expecting this to be a feature starring Dinah Shore or other 1940's musical starlet.) Some very satisfying twists of the old plot make this memorable and high on the repeat viewings scale.  Gene Tierney is wonderfully mercurial - sometimes hot-hot-hot and other times just plain icy cold. This was her only Oscar nominated film and you can see why she was picked here.  See Gene in this and in "Laura" and you will see two of the best 1944 leading actress film perfomances	1
262688	I was so pleased to find this movie on Amazon.com. I had watched it as a child and pinned over it when I could not find it in stores over the years. This is such a pure love story, with the main characters completely selfless and yet charmingly real. There are too few unpretentious, untampered romantic movies around these days. Most reveal too much- literally. But this one leaves you truly satisfied while lending pleasant modesty to a normally scandalous genre	1
271015	Fraser's film is truly a winner in production quality.   His attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil.  Despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film; eye-candy performers, lighting, fantastic musical score, and riske scenes, this film has visually appealing sequences.  If anyone is interested in film and theatrical production, I would highly recommend the director's commentary-you really get an insight to an artist in process.  From the commentary, it seems that Fraser will never be finished with this film: a mentale that I admire in an artist.  Art is a process and is never perfect.	1
279513	Have watched it three times already.....thanks for being so speedy with the delivery	1
288923	THE AIDS SITUATION IS FAR GREATER THAN WE ARE TOLD /THE CORRUPTION IN AFRICA IS HORRIFIC / THE SITUATION IS BEYOND ANY HORROR FILM'S SCARE ANYTIME / THIS FILM OF LECARRE'S NOVEL BEARS GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR FUTURE ,OUR DESTINY . ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FILMS EVER MADE! ACTORS LIKE RALPH FIENNES & RACHEL WEITZ NEED MORE COMMENDATION FOR IT AND DIRECTOR FERNANDO MERELLES IS A GENIUS. AGRIPPING THRILLER FOR THE SERIOUS MOVIEGOVER.BRAVO 50 STARS	1
295466	This dvd does not claim to contain a debate about the origins of Christianity; it discusses an alternate viewpoint (as Dan Brown reminds us "the winners write the history books")This dvd is a nice antidote to all the oppressive ideas we have been raised with; esp. the idea of God as male, and the idea of women being unworthy of church leadership. This dvd includes interviews with Dan Burstein, Henry Lincoln, Martin Lunn, Lynn Picknett, Clive Prince, Dr. Karen Ralls, Dr. James Robinson, and Margaret Starbird. I particularly liked Margaret Starbird's interviews - she describes how when she first read "Holy Blood, Holy Grail", she found it blasphemous because she had been raised a loyal Catholic. But afterward, she had religious experiences regarding the content of that book which lead her to research Mary Magdalene and write "The Woman with the Alabaster Jar". She comes across as very rational, sensible and even heroic. It takes courage to contradict the dearly held beliefs of the majority. I thought Dan Burstein also made some very good points with his discussions about the lives and customs of Jewish people during the time Jesus lived. I think this dvd is an important reminder that just because you have been taught something all your life - that doesn't mean it is necessarily the truth. To be truly alive is to continue to search for the truth as long as you live	1
305989	Since "ER" debuted on NBC in 1994, it's taken the nation by storm.  It's wonderfully produced by author Michael Chricton,  a former surgeon before his writing career.  For numerous years, it was the #1 drama series on television.  The show starts with the cast of Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis), Noah Wyle (John Carter), Julianna Margulies (Carol Hathaway), and Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton).  It has since won and been nominated for several awards including Emmys.  Its hospital action combined with personal drama always draws audiences deeply into every scene for every episode.  Its emergency scenes grown in intensity and drama through the episodes.	1
314688	We started with "There Goes a Dump Truck" which actually features a different "Dave."  This first Dave was in the Dumptruck, Tractor and Farm Truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is. The newer Dave (Dave Hood) is in all the rest (along with his sidekick, Becky, in some) and is much less goofy than the other Dave.  I don't think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both.	1
319908	I remember watching this in high school. I thought it was great fun then and my kids think it still is now. Okay, we're not talking Academy award material here (Emmy?).	1
327568	Barbershop is a rare event in African-American filmmaking. It's one of the few that actually tells a fairly accurate story of what life is like for African-Americans. I love the fact that the movie showed how diverse the African-American community is; we see black people from different walks of life and different lifestyles shown onscreen. I really liked this movie. We definitely need more films like this	1
337758	Audrey, without Givenchy, and only a portion of her face visible, few lines and much conflict gives one of the great performances.  The depth of the movie, the richness, amount to a great piece of art.  Certainly, the movie is not "fun," but it attests to a time when a movie about the struggle with faith could be a blockbuster	1
344711	My kids (age 5, 7 and 10) love this movie.  I actually bought the VHS version many years ago when the movie first came out but wanted the DVD so we could watch it in the car when while traveling.  My husband and I originally bought this movie for my little nephew to watch so it's nice that we can share it with our own kids now.  If you love animals, this movie is for you.  The DVD jacket says this movie took a few years to make and I believe it.  It's absolutely amazing how the animals relate to each other.  This has got to be one of the best animal films out there.	1
350465	I really like this DVD - you can get some really good exercise in only 10 minutes.  Lara does not waste time on lengthy explanations between exercises, and she moves quickly from one exercise to another.  I like the variety of exercises - there are not too many rep's on any one exercise, which keeps the workout from being monotonous.	1
360363	I saw this show on Logo. Boy I loved it. I wish I was there	1
368733	This DVD contains all of the original Ben Stiller Show episodes, plus an extra un-aired episode. The show was not only far ahead of its time, but also timeless as is evidenced by Stiller's subsequent successful movie roles that drew from many of the characters from the TV series. For anyone who was a fan of the TV series or Stiller's movies, this DVD is a must	1
377495	From the first time our leading characters' eyes meet, you can feel the temperature rise in the room.  Not your average, sappy "love conquers all" type of love story; this film shows the courage it takes to help love conquer	1
382442	It is nice to see Sarah Michelle Geller in a not-so-nice, anti-heroine role here. I'm so used to seeing her as "Buffy"	1
389927	This is a highly entertaining film with an incredibly minimalist screenplay that succeeds beyond all expectations. This film's strengths are its characters and the actors that portray them. Sean Connery plays Captain Marko Ramius with great bravado and charisma relying greatly on his mesmerizing screen presence to maneuver the entire direction of this film. Tim Curry is amusing as the dutiful Dr. Petrov in a role well suited for him. The rest of the cast balances out the histrionics of Sean Connery and Tim Curry with realistic and convincing performances to bring authenticity and realism to the drama of this film. Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan, James Earl Jones as Admiral James Greer, Sam Neill as Captain Vasily Borodin, Scott Glenn as Commander Bart Mancuso, Richard Jordan as Dr. Jeffrey Pelt and an impressive Peter Firth as Political Officer Ivan Putin bring a needed sense of pragmatism to their collective roles to bolster the dramatics and emotion of the story. This was probably one of Alec Baldwin's best performances and he truly conducts himself in the manner that the character of Jack Ryan should have been portrayed. Baldwin perfectly conveyed the analytical mind that the character of Jack Ryan embodied. Sam Neill is also brilliant as the dedicated officer who also possesses a very human side that perhaps puts him in conflict with carrying out his duties to the full extent of his country's political dictates and ambitions. Sam Neill has a wonderful role in this regard and he plays it flawlessly. I liked Scott Glenn's character immensely as the US Commander who truly has to rely on his instincts and his logical interpretation of facts and events to face what is put before him. The list of performances goes on but the point is that portrayal of these characters and how they think and conduct themselves is at the heart of this film. Their efforts make this film a great political, action-adventure and emotional drama.	1
393274	Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as IMF agent Ethan Hunt,who is framed for murder after the death of his IMF team.Together with the help of two other IMF agents,Hunt sets out to find the real murderer.Cornered most of the movie and set to his limits,Hunt and team are hard put to catch the assailants.It all leads to a final showdown on a speeding bullet train with an unlikely foe.Hard core action and awesome intellegence meet in this exhillirating action drama by filmmaker Brian DePalma	1
397821	China: The Panda Adventure is an IMAX film that tells a story..	1
404649	I guess I understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it's year of release, 1986.  Prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of "Purple Rain," both the film and the soundtrack.  And critics love to knock someone off a pedestal, which is what they did to Prince in those days.  Many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip.  They couldn't believe Prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself.  It was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn't trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy.	1
416451	The direction was A grade acting top class and to top it you had Eric and Clint eastwood .Eric fleming was mindblowing .One has yet to come across  an actor with his confidence class and authority .Yes I agree we always tend to focus on Clint forgetting that it was Eric who was mile ahead of him.Todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western.Yes the fact is without Rawhide there would be no Clint Eastwood	1
422331	Bob Crane shot to television stardom in the 1960s as the star of the television series Hogan's Heroes. However, while he was enjoying the life of a TV star, he was simultaneously delving into dark territory in his personal life - sexual promiscuity and deviance. Auto Focus tells the story of Bob Crane as a tragic cautionary tale of the dangers of excess.	1
430229	I love this seasion but the packaging could be better, I got cut with my copy of it	1
436627	It embarrases me that I, a music man, have let this many years go by without reviewing this splendid movie. My wife rented it from a Hasting's video store back when DVDs were not widely distributed. I was in awe of the movie as it ended because I had no clue what to expect, and I wasn't expecting much anyway.	1
445035	This is my first review for Amazon. I've always felt that the reviews that I read were adequate to represent the movies and anime that I liked. Not this time.	1
456997	"Animal House" raised the bar, and set a standard for all comedies that followed. Many have tried to duplicate the originality of this movie, and all have failed to come close.	1
470600	This exercise video was very easy to get started on and you could do all the exercises in very limited space.  This is great for people who do not have alot of room.  After exercising to the video, I felt really good, energized.  I would definitely recommend it to someone who is just starting out exercising. It is low impact and easy to follow	1
477995	"Dave" is a lot of fun, as a look-alike gets to pretend to be president, gradually gets a big head and tries to use the power, and makes high-stakes enemies. I am a big fan of Sigourney Weaver, and she is very good here. Kevin Kline does well, as well. The forces of good beat back the dark side of politics for awhile, and an ordinary guy finds extraordinary adventure and true love. Definitely worth a rental, if romantic and comic politics with a bit of danger is your bag	1
485225	Season one of Nelwlyweds is hilarious....you will enjoy watching Nick & Jessica and all the funny moments that took place the first year of their marriage! The extra footage on the dvd's gives you even more insight from the "lovebirds" themselves! I recommond "Newlyweds" to all the Nick & Jessica fans out there	1
488791	I was fourteen years old when I attended the New York Premier of this movie at the Rivoli Theater. I have the original Premier Book from the theater; which is NOT for sale. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful Ingrid Bergman. So did millions of other young men. This movie did not win the award of the year; it was overshadowed by "Casablanca"; which in my estimation, was of inferior quality, compared to For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Bob Richard	1

508731	The movie is about two men who fake fairytales for money. They are employed to stop these children from disapearing into a forest in a town. Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm take on the job or be forced to die and go into the forest. This is a really good movie and is an action packed fairytale	1
514016	This re-telling of the so-called "zoot suit riots" that rocked the Los Angeles homefront during World War II gets the facts right, but tells them rather poorly.  Part of it is the super-stagey presentation, which basically is a filming of the play this was based on (right down to the shaking props and backdrops) and which takes little advantage of the possibilities of the film medium. Plus, Edward James Olmos is absolutely insufferable as the uber-symbolic Voice of The Barrio, although Daniel Valdez and Tyne Daly (!) are okay in their respective roles as a young man railroaded by the white establishment for a crime he did not commit, and as the commie agitator who comes to his defense.  Anyone interested in the time period and in Chicano politics may benefit from watching this -- I rented it while doing some reseach on the "pachucho" R&B music scene -- but in dramatic and filmic terms, this is not a first-rate production.  It's hammy and ham-fisted.  Latter-day star spotting:  El Teatro Campesion veteran Robert Beltran (of future "Star Trek Voyager" notoriety) has a bit role as a modern-day audience member..	1
524767	This one of those movies that I can watch over and over again.  The story is great, acting is good, and seeing the jerks get it in the end is the best.   The force of nature is just amazing to me and given the opportunity I would love to go on a Tornado hunt.  The special effects in the movie are very well done and realistic and the ending is perfect for this movie.  I would of given this one 5 stars but it has to be one heck of a movie for 5 stars.  The loss of a star is for some of the actors average job at there parts.  Rent it, buy it, watch it!  It is well worth your time and money.	1
537106	Not very familiar with Noam Chomsky's work but I have listened to many people say that he has very strong arguments. This film is proof of those arguments. Noam Chomsky has facts, refers to original sources, provides context and analysis and leaves  you feeling that you have heard a very solid and well-research argument. This film is a collection of such arguments on issues and events affecting many of us in the world. America's invasion of Iraq, the war on terror and what is behind it other than 9-11, and other topics are rich and insightful. This film provides a nice balance on Chomsky by giving us some insight into HIM which is interesting. I find him more fascinating now than I did as a skeptic who was challenged to actually read his material. This film gives those new to Noam Chomsky's books an excellent overview of the issues and events that he has written about in the last five years or so. After watching this film I went out and read 9-11 and his latest book. While good, the film gives us the same information but in a more direct and candid manner.	1
552045	I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed.	1
558540	A true love-it-or-hate-it movie: my reaction fits closer with the first group.  This gritty look at the dark side of the drug culture plays like an open wound. The parallel stories chronicle a widow who descends into an addiction to diet pills, while her son tries to make a living dealing, although he, his partner, and his girlfriend smoke and snort a lot of the profits.  The director's jarring style fits the subject matter well, and Ellen Burstyn's performance as the diet pill addict is nothing short of amazing.  Julia Roberts beat her for Best Actress in 2000 with Erin Brockovich, which was a fine role and performance, but Burstyn was in another world.  Those who hate the film will complain about the style and whether the events at the end make any sense.  I can understand the second objection, hence four stars rather than five.	1
561210	Maybe it helps to be unfamiliar with Chekov's work and therefore have no preconceived notions, but I found this British made drama to be absorbing and quietly powerful in depicting the sadness and futility of pre-revolution Russia. The story of a once wealthy family slowly accepting their loss of prestige and slendor blooms like a beautiful but lonely rose, and thankfully the depths of the drama never get very sloppy, sentimental, or even tragic	1

It's a great way to appreciate life and the parade scene is one of the best.  It's easy to tell from this film that Matthew Broderick was destined to be a star	1
592511	Haven't we all been there? Wishing we could be better than someone else? Wishing that we had our turn in the spotlight? This is exactly how the movie "Cheaters" affected me. I found it truly amazing that this movie was made on a true story like this. The plot is really incredible and actually makes you ponder the question "What would I do in this situation?" Jeff Daniels and Jena Malone give such incredible performances in this movie. I believe that they are very convincing. If you are in the mood to be emotionally touched by a movie, "Cheaters" is the true direction for you to head in	1

You also get to find out who Dirty is or whatever. Pete says things about him in a couple of places (online) and all i could think is "who is that?" so thats also very exciting. I would say as long as you have a good sense of humor your pretty much safe buying this.	1

B000BG08MS:jean_cocteau's_unearthly_masterpiece:h._bala_"me_too_can_read"	In an attempt to meet more girls, I took French many, many years ago when I was still in junior high school (middle school to you young 'uns). In class, my French teacher treated us to a film screening of Jean Cocteau's LA BELLE ET LA BETE (BEAUTY AND THE BEAST). Truthfully, back then, I didn't think much of it other than being something too "arty." But, over the past two decades, I've seen this film a number of times and now have a decidedly higher opinion of it. LA BELLE ET LA BETE is a seriously important movie and a groundbreaking entry into the world of cinema. It's certainly Cocteau's masterpiece. Without a doubt, it provided the direct inspiration for Disney's Oscar-nominated version, as well as greatly influencing CBS's 1987 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST television series.	1
B00008YLUX:ziggy_played_guitar...:i_love_ziggy	While this DVD was obviously filmed in the early 1970s with the picture quality to match at times, the genius of David Bowie shines  through. As adults too young to remember or have seen Ziggy Stardust, it was an amazing look at the time period. The sound quality is suprisingly good, although some camera angles are distracting at times. It was also neat to hear Bowie's pronouncement of "This is our last tour ever." Little did he know... This DVD is worth every penny. Rock on	1

B00004TZS3:"strictly_u.s.a":charlotte_kendall_"blondee1234"	This is an awesome movie! I think its better than Anchors Aweigh. Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra are two baseball players named Eddie O'Brien and Dennis Ryan who play for the Wolves. During the off-season Eddie and Dennis are vaudeville stars. When they return for the baseball season the whole team is horrifed to hear that the new owner K.C. Higgins wants to take an active part in coaching. As it turns out the K in K.C. Higgins happens to stand for Katherine (Esther Williams) so the new owner is a woman. Katherine dosn't fall for womanizer Eddie so the two don't get along at all!! Dennis does fall for her though, but Katherine isn't in love with him. Shirley Delwyn (Betty Garrett) has her eyes on Dennis and she won't give up on him! Also in the cast is Jules Munshin who plays Nat Goldberg, Dennis and Eddie's baseball pal.	1

B00004U2EH:outstanding_classroom_intructional_tool:scott_r._harding	It's my first semester teaching a general-student Jazz History course, and I wanted something beyond the textbook to get the students involved.  I bought this video as a &quot;best-of-all-options&quot; choice, and was  bowled over by it's thoroughness and attention to detail.  Everything we'd  discussed about Armstrong during class was there on the tape, reinforcing  my lectures and giving the kids a nice opportunity to both hear AND see the  legendary Louis.  For pure entertainment alone it was worthwhile, but for  instructional purposes I'd consider it a necessity for any future jazz  classes I'd teach.  I paid $16 bucks for it, but having seen it I think  I'd've paid fifty!  (Shh!  Don't tell Amazon!	1

B000C3L2B6:teddy_ruxpin_-_come_dream_with_me_tonight!:llumynia	There can't be a better storyteller than Teddy Ruxpin. As I child I was enthralled with this animated story and would impatiently play with my toy Teddy Ruxpin as I waited for Saturday morning to come again so I could see another episode of the TV series. This show has a clear progression of plot development that starts right from episode one. So many cartoons are just one-shots, an individual small plot for each episode. Teddy Ruxpin was an epic adventure that caught you up and carried you along for a fantastic adventure! Along the way, kids learn important morals, values, and a lot about their own world. This is a fantastic cartoon to share with children of any age. And what a great price! Well worth it!	1
B00000F0VW:one_of_the_best:devin_mcnally_"mcdevster"	Jean Renoir's masterpiece, 'the grand illusion', is truly a film about humanity - it is a universal theme, something we can all understand and relate to. The triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times, is kind of an ironic theme considering Hitler's imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history. Nevertheless, Jean Renoir's poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films.	1

B0002G2B2M:kaufman_lends_surprising_humanism_to_an_exceptional_mind-bending_story_of_loss_and_regret:ed_uyeshima	Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's reality-bending work has become such a Hollywood staple that he is becoming more distinctive than the directors who give life to his wildly imaginative and solipsistic scripts. He dares to give dramatic form to nebulous psychological states that border on horror stories. Directed by Michel Gondry, this 2004 study in love and loss is no exception, as Kaufman takes the notion of a struggling relationship and inverts it into a manic piece of science fiction involving a medical procedure to scrub one's memory. At the same time, Gondry and Kaufman have injected a strong dose of humanism into this film by grounding it with characters that are relatable as much as they are quirky.	1

B00005BJX9:ten_bad_guys_with_automathic_weapons?_they_always_miss!!!:viskaya	This movie is all about entertaining.The combination between "Die Hard" and typical martial arts flick works in many levels, but the production values are Hong Kong`s, don`t miss that point.Fans of Jet Li are welcome, but action fans be careful. Here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames, exploding building models, chopped off dummies, you name it. The characters are extreme in their own context: Jet Li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor, loyal, gentleman, honorable, deadly, you know, a portrait of the typical good guy. The bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking. He doesn't fight or kick much in this film, but he shoots a lot, dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all, his revolver shoots 30 bullets without reloading, he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator, that happens to be be the right size...	1
6305756430:a_good_movie:	This is an O.K movie. I give it a 3.5. It starts out with the origin of Mewtwo, as using DNA from the legendary Pokemon Mew's eyebrow fossil to create a clone, Mewtwo. Soon, Team Rocket leader Giovanni tries to control Mewtwo after he destroys the lab from which he was born in, but Mewtwo has other plans, thinking his purpose is not to serve humans. So he invites the most powerful Pokemon trainers to the New Island to see who can stand up to him. But things get outta control when Mewtwo steals all the Pokemon in black Pokeballs and creates artificial "Super-Clones" to prove that clones are the strongest in the universe. But he didn't count on Ash, a young Pokemon Trainer. Ash destroys the cloning machine, thus bringing Mew to the scene and saving the captured Pokemon. Who'll win? The superclones or the originals? Mew or Mewtwo? You've got to see it to beleive it	1
B000056WR3:golden_oldie:that_review_guy_"vampire_fanatic!"	In the days of the Arcades there was a good movie that came out (and funny enough had a great Arcade game) called Krull. Now mind you, I really had no idea what this movie was all about before i saw it (when i was a whole bunch younger) just saw the 5 bladed "glaive" and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie (including those terrible scifi D&D movies ugh) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the Slayers and from then on its a totally different experience. with such ultimate favorites as the Emerald Seer, The Widow of the Web and the Cyclops and of course the shapeshifting (a bit daft too) wizard with some very strange habits (i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come.	1

B00064AFGE:romantic_no-budget_movie.:wing_lee_"filmfan"	200 American is actually quite pleasantly romantic gay comedy. Even though it looks like a no-budget episode of Queer As Folk or intended to be a gay version of Pretty Woman, it's got a pretty good story. It doesn't rely on fancy production and lighting or cinematography. Most of the actors are straight playing gay roles. I was surprised to learn from the special features material that the entire cast and crew volunteer for this show, something that I can certainly relate to. The acting is acceptable but not great, because most of the actors are not that experienced. I was surprised that there was no production and wardrobe designer! The movie has some kind of charm about it, perhaps it's because it's so sincere and gimmick free, and even the love scenes are very low-key. I was very touched by the romantic plotline between the hustler and his new boss. There is something about a straight guy doing love scene with another male actor, it's very captivating. Sean Matic did a good job with his light Austrilian accent by the way. It's worth rental fee for sure.	1

Not only is it superior, photogrqphically speaking -- not only does it have beautiful & inspiring music -- it is factual and should open our eyes to what we have to lose in the name of oil!

I was born, raised and educated in one of the most beautiful places in the U.S. in Boulder, CO -- at the foot of the flatirons -- BUT I truly feel this Alaska wilderness is "God's Country."

0792160932:return_of_great_science_fiction:adam_paul_bailey	Although Tomorrow is Yesterday is an okay episode, it is not one to rave about.It is certainly not one of the original series' best. However, Return of the Archons is one of the best and one of my favourites.Kirk, Spock and McCoy investigate a planet where the inhabitants appear to be in a drug-induced state then rapidly change from walking peacefully and amiably along the streets into violent and looting maniacs that seem to lose all inhibitions. A mob attacks Kirk and crew and they are forced to defend themselves with their phasers. It seems the planet is run by a man named Landru, who advocates peace and tranquility to the extent that you get "absorbed".A kind of brainwash conditioning into thinking only of harmony and serenity.Later it is discovered that Landru is a computor projection;the edict of Landru who died 5,000 years ago has been continued by a computer I just read a review saying the solution to the Landru mystery won't surprise anyone, it sure surprised me. I didn't see that one coming	1
B000085EF9:a_charming,_clever_british_comedy:joe_sixpack_--__slipcue.com	Charles Laughton is typically wonderful in his broadly-played role as England's King, Henry the Eigth, who infamously married six different queens, divorcing or executing them as circumstances warranted.  The script to this magnificent Alexander Korda production is a witty jab at English history buffs, touching only briefly on the supposed treachery of Ann Boleyn,  concentrating instead on the preposterous emotional life of the lusty, capacious King. Laughton, as ever, is a marvel, skillfully presenting Henry at first as a thinly-cariacatured lout, and gracefully embuing him with gradual shades of pathos and humanity.  Viewers who look to this film as historical drama are clearly missing the point: this is all about the cleverly-rendered script, which turns British schoolboy lessons on their heads, and on the classy ensemble acting, which admittedly may be hard to focus on with the lamentable quality of the current print (I'm writing in the year 2003; perhaps Criterion or some other class-act movie restoration company can correct this problem soon).  Still, fans of early British cinema will enjoy this film a lot	1
B000051YMR:great_cast,_but_writing_sometimes_falls_through_the_cracks:	The casting here was excellent - Ben Stiller, Elle Macpherson, Sarah Jessica Parker were all great. In fact, I am convinced that Elle Macpherson can act because of the 3 movies I have now seen her in, she plays decidedly different people in each one. She is perfectly cast as Joe's dream woman. I found Eric Schaeffer's character the least appealing of the whole cast. Some of the jokes here are wildly funny.  The audience is never given a clue that the Jane Lindquist character is only getting involved with Joe to indulge the fantasy world he had created of her. I thought it was odd that she enjoyed his voyeurism and then seemed honestly interested in him sexually, but was not interested in a relationship with him. Earlier her character makes a statement that the world makes too much of the sexually charged days in the beginning of relationships, people move on after that part is over and that a lasting relationship is what she wants. That part did not make sense. This could have been improved by some better writing and better character development. The humor here is what makes this worth watching	1
B0007OY2P8:loved_it_from_beginning_to_end:angie_uk	VHS - I have watched this over and over and LOVED every minute of it so much so I have now ordered the DVD I only wished the film could have lasted longer.

B00068NVG6:rogers_and_hammersteins_cinderella:angela_burton_"catholicgirly"	I loved this movie...it was a little hard to follow because of the commercial break timings in it.

0783227329:what_a_guy:larry_vandesande	Daniel Day-Lewis must be the most versatile film actor in the world. He looks like a different person in almost every film he makes. I assume that's the real Day-Lewis in this flick about the rebellion in Northern Ireland, revenge and absolution. His romantic interest, Emily Watson, puts in a good performance too. Day-Lewis looks a lot different than he did in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but he is just as compelling in his performance. I thought this movie degraded a bit at the end with its somewhat Hollywood finale, but otherwise I enjoyed it. If you like substantial filmmaking, good acting, great drama, unfamiliar vistas and a good story, you'll enjoy it too	1
B00000I69D:can't_you_hear_the_wind_howl?_a_vision_of_robert_johnson:charles_salt	I would reccomend this film to any Robert Johnson fan as well as to anyone just getting into the blues who wants to know where its really at. It includes some great interviews with Johnny Shines, Robert jr Lockwood and others who knew Robert. Its worth it just to hear Lockwood play an unrecorded song of R.J.'s! The parts where Keb' Mo' re-enacts segments from R.J.'s life are well done and effectively illustrate what life would have been like back then for a traveling bluesman. My only criticism would be that there are few extra DVD features,however, that doesn't stop me watching this film again and again! A very informative insight into the life of one of the greatest Delta bluesmen	1
B000053GYA:an_interesting_movie:h._grim	This was a very interesting movie.  A friend told me to watch this movie after I told him that I really liked the movie The Skeleton Key.  I think I liked The Skeleton Key better... but this was still a really good movie.  There are a few scenes with nudity in it.  Not a movie for the youngsters. We had to stop the movie a couple times to talk about it and at the end my husband was the only one who guessed how it was going to end.  A good movie if you want a movie that keeps you guessing	1
B00005ATQD:not_to_be_discounted:jennifer_atwood_"jennie"	Don't discount this film because you are dismayed by Tom Cruise. This film is excellent and a must see. The symbolism in this film alone makes it worth a look. Attempt to ignore good old Tom and rekindle your love for him pre-insanity. Kubrick rarely gets enough accolades for this movie, as he should	1
B000065U36:watch_it_for_jack_black:h._s._anand	Orange County as a movie tries to play it safe. The Director tries to be in tow with what he believes is a good film. I must say for around 50% of the film I was laughing. Jack Black is truly my favourite character in the film. Colin Hanks,the lead actor, is a boring sophisticated person.He also plays Black's brother in the film.	1
6305531293:the_other_sister,:adele_thompson_"tinkie"	I did not think, that the women Juliet Lewis, plays in this movie was mentally retatrted, i think she just has a disablity.\	1
B00006BT6D:a_dysfunctional_woody_allen_prior_to_therapy:randy_keehn	I think Woody Allen is the best director currently in the business and I believe his serious-themed movies are the reason.  He excells at making us look at ourselves.  If I'm not mistaken, "Interiors" was his first venture into dramatic movies.  For having led the way, this movie is noteworthy.  However, it is also exemplary in helping define the genre of the Woody Allen movie.  It defines the Woody Allen film by showing us what it is not.	1
B00076YPFI:fine_show,_great_band:juke_jar	This is a wonderful show and very true to the band's recent live performances, albeit with a condensed songlist. I give it only 4 stars because I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Winwood and band live and the Sound Stage gig seems just a tad below that experience--which is admittedly an unfair comparison. Nothing to knock about this tidy show by a true virtuoso (actually a band of virtuosos). Consider it 4.5.	1
B0002DKCMQ:good_(if_not_always_clean)_fun...:daniela_enkelmann_"movie_buff"	I ordered this movie for my husband. He LOVES it! It's a funny entertaining movie and something you can watch over and over. No big plot - but it's got it's moments. I'm quite sure there is something for every European to be offended by... So keep a sense of humor and enjoy	1
B00005JLEM:outstanding_concert:jason_chamberlain	The Concert in Central Park is not only the best of Simon & Garfunkel's concerts, it is one of the best of anyone's concerts, in my estimation. The crowd was really in to it, and Simon and Garfunkle responded to them and delivered a top notch experience which captured the essence of the best of their music, and the era it was written in.	1
B000AM6MM8:the_movie_and_the_dvd:j._donie_"quill_and_lens"	One could review Kingdom of Heaven on a lot of levels ... as an action packed medieval adventure/romance ... as a vehicle for some of your favorite actors ... or as a statement about humanity's less than perfect attempts to find spiritual meaning in life in a way that doesn't lead to warfare with people of differing points of view.  I was expecting mostly the first two ... and was pleasantly surprised to find a reasonable amount of the third.   My favorite quote from the movie summed up a powerful feeling I've had about spirituality for some time now:	1
B000065Q9A:spectrum_is_green!!!:julio_castro_karg	Wow!!! I bought this set a couple of months ago and I've been watching each episode little by little, and enjoying each one of them a lot!!! It's interesting to watch Captain Scarlet again, thirty-something years after the last time I watched it back in the late 60s (when I was 7 or 8 years old)!	1
B000NOIX7K:hogan's_last_laugh_:timm_breyel	This is the final season of Hogan's Heroes. Sgt. Kinchloe (Ivan Dixon) left the series in Season 5 and was replaced by Sgt. Richard Baker (Kenneth Washington). The other original cast members are still up to their wacky antics of outsmarting the Nazis. And, it's still hilarious.	1
B0001UZRN4:ichi_returns_home:tubby_"tubby"	With the flip of a coin , it's home I go. Ichi returns to the town he was raised as a child only to find that much has changed since he last left. A good film in the series I gave it five stars because I am bias and think that they all deserve five. This one was a strong introduction into Ichi's personal life along with the background of villians and lost ruffians with little or no way to reedeem their karma. Of course the cane sword is revealed yet again which leads to some good gore. I thought this was an all around good story with lots of underlying plays on greed and deception, and above all ,love ,shame and guilt from Ichi whom never seems to want to be bothered after it all goes down. Much is lost to our friend Ichi and he seems to just lose more.	1
B0007LPDLS:cheeborger!_cheeborger!:david_felter	One of the warmest, most pleasantly lip-smacking film's ever!	1
B0007GADYK:a_great_journey!:olivier_garnier	I really loved this dvd. There is some information for everybody, beginners as well as advanced. There is also a nice presence from Paul himself who does not hestitate to retrace the painful and private premices of this album. I was not necessarily a huge fan of his music and knew absolutely nothing of his personnal life and of his method in composing. This dvd, without being too personnal, made me discover the craftmanship of the composer and the depth of the man.	1
B000067FY1:the_vampire_lestat_&_the_ancient_queen_akasha_:cedar_bay_press_llc_"lady_donna_roberts"	After many years of sleeping in his coffin, the vampire Lestat awakens only to find that the world has changed and he wants to be a part of it. He gathers a following and becomes a rock star only to find that his music awakens the ancient Queen Akasha and she wants him to become her king. Worth at least a rental!	1
B00005NOO7:if_you_are_a_kinison_fan,_buy_this!:sean_logsdon	Any Sam Kinison fan needs to own this DVD or video.  You get 2 of Sam's HBO specials plus many special stand up features and Sam's home movies.  The only reason I did not give this box set a 5 star rating is the fact that in the first special feature called: rare stand up(I love the special features on DVDs), Sam told many jokes that were already on the HBO special.  Other than that, Sam's comedy is unlike anything you will see today.  He will really be thought of as a comedy legend.  These DVD's will crack you up.  I would recomend buying the Sam Kinison CDs, Live From Hell, and Have you seen me lately?  The Cd's(just listen to them in your car or at home) will give you the complementary material you need(plus the HBO specials) to truely love Sam Kinison.  He is one of the best, and you will be satisfied with with any purchase.  Just buy 1 CD or DVD and you will be hooked	1
B00004CZEW:west_side_story:michelle_faison_"chelle"	Timeless classic movie. 2 of the songs are frequently re-done by various artist	1
B0002EXFNI:unexpected:emily_"emily_louise1989"	You might think from the title and the commercials this movie is about a super sexy porn star slut...but it's actually the opposite. I really liked how the movie was done to portray the struggles some girls really have to go through in their carrers and mixed it with the toughness of high school.	1
0792843568:they_don't_make_'em_like_woody_very_often...:grigory's_girl_"grigory's_girl"	This is one of the great biopic films ever made.  More often than not, film biopics are too rushed.  They try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives, and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives.  This is not one of those films.  It just covers Woody Guthrie's adult life, from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer, and his passionate defense of the working man.  The look of the film is deliberate, in that it's washed out.  The hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film.  They're really lively, where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves.  The film has a real genuine feel to it, like you're actually watching real people.  David Carradine is amazing as Woody Guthrie.  He makes you think you're actually watching Woody himself.  He did his own singing and stuntwork on the film.  Ronny Cox is excellent as well, and he does his own singing too (remember, Cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in Deliverance).  Randy Quaid and Melinda Dillon offer great supporting roles as well.  This is a fabulous film, and it feels short at 2 1/2 hours.	1
B0001CCY0G:yngwie_spoils_the_whole_thing:br_rk	This is one of the best G3s.  Maybe even the best.  I would have said that it was definitely the best if not for Mr.Malmsteen - the nicest thing one can say about the latter is that he knows his minor and major scales.	1

B000HXDWOG:heartless_under_blade:matthew_k._merkel_"chenzen"	This film i have to say is beautiful looking, from the characters to the landscape. Although lacking in numerous and long fight scenes, it does keep things interesting with matrix like effects. The only problem is the love between the two main characters . The movie never lets you feel the love between them , and the girl seems always distant about the love anyway  i mean it is called heart under blade right?  The main ninja character has the coolest power and he always seems troubled to use them it. This film is more of a drama sprinkled with ninja action and beautiful visuals!	1
B000BDGW7G:enjoyed_it_and_learned:sally_c._gearhart_"old_movie_buff"	Really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of Budd Boetticher.  The collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special	1
B00004Y2QD:great_dvd,_but_keep_in_mind:mezawa	Tihs DVD truly has incredible camerawork, and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins, but some things people don't realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told.  PLEASE take the time to read this.	1

B00005JN0Q:classic_hayley_mills_film:m._hayden_"paranormal_artist"	This DVD version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable.  Hayley Mills is her usual irrepressible self, and the supporting cast is top notch. The feline actor in particular!  ;)	1

B000LXGXX4:heart_of_the_girls:h._lenderking	There are two story lines here, one an unqualified celebration of the state of girls' prep sports after a generation of Title IX's beneficial impact, and another the very qualified consideration of the state of some individual girls' athletic lives after a generation of Title IX's less beneficial side-effects.  Heartbreak, fury, exultation are the viewer's rewards.  Only quibble is that the climactic game was documented in too abbreviated a manner	1
B000JLTRA4:desparate_housewives:peter_r._berry_"goprocks.com"	It's just like the Hit TV Show!  In fact they probably got the idea for the TV show from this movie. Actually I thought it was more of a comedy than anything. I saw it on the "WE" network.	1
B000A0Y7NQ:i_felt_like_i_was_there_at_the_concert.:brett_e._hegr_"codewraith"	Well, almost. The seats were good and I drank straight out of the bottle. The DVD wasn't what I thought I had purchased but I'm not at all unhappy about getting it. Very, very, very good quality audio/video and I don't mind watching it often	1
B000E5KUKG:the_third_movie_is_horrible.......................:mogillon	The third movie has nothing to do with book 3. If you loved the books, you will find this movie completely unbelievable. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed of himself for being in this piece of garbage.	1
B0002OXRU4:the_wiggles_-_wiggle_time:lou_a._allen	This DVD of the Wiggles is my 21/2 year old grandsons favorite.  He watches it every day and never tires of it.  I enjoy watching it with him.  The Wiggles are great entertainment for people of all ages.  I don't think you can go wrong with The Wiggles	1
B00073K7JY:zatoichi_-_the_blind_swordsman_box_set:goddess_anjanee	OK, this definately looks very promising.  I saw a version of this on the Flix channel about three nights ago.  It was good.  If that is any indication on how good the show is then this Collector's Edition Box Set of the older series should be better.  I am going to purchase this soon.  Once I purchase it, I will let you know how good it really is. I'll give another review once I purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes .	1

0792160347:american_nightmare:vagabond77	"American Gigolo" stars Richard Gere of a high priced male prostitute.  He is coasting along with his rich southern Cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered.  When he is considered the main suspect, he goes on the run, with his only friend being the wife of a politician.  At the begining he tells people that he is a moral man,  for example, he dosn't service gays, more on that in a moment.  It is interseting to note that Gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in "Pretty Woman" and it made a star out of Julia Roberts.  But that is where the similarities end.  This is a much darker story about hypocracy.  When he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him.  In the end, he finds himself a hypocrit, because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job; gays, S and M, anything to avoid jail.  The only love story here is about him and the politician's wife (Lauren Hutten).  It is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him, even for his own protection.  For all it's darkness there is one funny scene.  Richard Gere is called in for a line up at the police department.  He tells the other men in the line up that he got paid, and the others get angry and cause a scene, averting the attention off of Gere.  This is a really good movie as an examination of society's attitude toward sex.  This film was written and directed by Paul Schrader, if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to "Taxi Driver".  Richard Gere is wooden, but his character is cold and icy, so that approach is right.  Lauren Hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man; she seems sincere in wanting to help Gere.  But I thought the standout performance was Bill Duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing (as oppose to Gere's 'Madam'), but also provides the warning to Gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out.  And another future "Pretty Woman" player is present; Hector Elanzo.   He plays the detective on Gere's trail; but he is slimy and rather unlikable here.  Well worth your time, but for adults only	1

B00066KWNS:rockabilly_revival!:spring_heeled_matt	This disc is pure gold! Featuring a FULL live performance from their 2004 European tour and tons of classic and backstage footage this is the ultimate Stray Cats fan collectible! The concert documented on this disc is so satisfying you would think it was still the early 80's. They show almost no signs of age and you can tell they pour their heart out into the show. They go through all their classics and then some. Whether it's "Stray Cat Strut" "Gene And Eddie" or "Rumble In Brighton" what you see and hear on this disc is flawless. Must buy for ALL music fans, not just fans of the Cats	1

B00009MECE:a_must_for_dancehall_fans:"fifthvenom"	if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing...	1
B00005JKTI:excellent_movie:maria_i._neely	This is a fantastic movie! The acting is superb, and it keeps you guessing until the end. Nicole Kidman deserved her Oscar	1
1572526653:good:"lorenzojim"	If you're looking to hear Robert Johnson's songs, you should probably buy one of the awesome collections availible.  As this legend and musical genius has now been dead for 65 years, I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for besides other people covering his songs, and talk about his life... that's all we have now.  And of course the covers do not outdo him; that would be impossible.  But there is some very thoughtful discussion on the life of Robert Johnson and the world he lived in.  The discussion with a former classmate is touching, and the covers of his songs by those who knew him (Robert Lockwood Jr., Honeyboy Edwards)and by some of the new delta-blues talent such as Guy Davis, Roy Rogers and especially Alvin Youngblood Heart blew me away.  Gov't Mule and Sonny Landreth do some awesome electric renditions of his work.  The major let downs are the cuts into interviews and pointless displays of the rock n' roll hall of fame gathering, and also Bob Weir's performance, which is just plain bad.  All in all, it is a good film, and it's nice to actually be able to watch people play his music, as we will never be able to see the real thing	1
B0006ZM8M2:not_as_bad_as_i_remembered.:kithi_prem-on	I remember putting Season 9 as the worst season of Friends in my book, but it's not as bad as I remembered. Some episodes are actually incredibly funny. The faux pas was when they started to have Aisha Tyler guess star as Charlie, and have her come between Joey and Ross. Also, the whole story line with Rachel's infatuation for Joey could've been better executed, or shouldn't have been there at all. It got bad towards the end, but I'm not disappointed. The stuff leadings towards it was classic Friends	1
B00077BOTW:a_cozy_classic:l._anne	This movie is such a breath of fresh air. Finally there's a movie that's profound, amusing, and relatable. It's nice to watch something that really hits home without begin cheesy or overdone and you can never go wrong with Jean Louisa Kelly or Amanda Peet	1
B000BB1MDC:buy_it:john_jeter	These are excellent performances for a very reasonable price.  The look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is "dated" but the performances easily shine through.  Not quite as well played, recorded or filmed as Bernstein's many later Unitel films but still well worth the investment.   I won't spend time on details but rest assured it's all great stuff!	1
B000EU1Q5E:the_best_place_by_the_fire_was_kept_for...the_storyteller.,_:h._bala_"me_too_can_read"	In 1987 and 1988, JIM HENSON'S THE STORYTELLER aired and became an instant showpiece for television, a truimphant (but short-lived) series breathing fresh life into nine lesser-known northern European fairy tales and, later, into four timeless stories drawn from Greek mythology. These old folk and fairy tales, mined from countries such as Germany and Russia and compiled in 2 discs here, along with the Greek tales, are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers: John Hurt for the European fables and Michael Gambon for the Greek re-tellings. But, with much respect to Mr. Gambon, who himself does a fine job, it is John Hurt who decidedly draws my attention. Hurt, with the more eye-catching portrayal, is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.	1
B00000JWWG:breathtaking_antonioni_agoraphobia!:miko	5 stars to the film itself! Here's a painful study of a woman's descent to lunacy amidst a desolate, uncaring and eventually foreboding backdrop of  industrial waste. The character study is not unlike claustrophobic  Polanski's Repulsion but dwells on Vitti's being consumed by her external  surroundings as opposed to Deneuve's intensive plunge to schizophrenia. The  pace and landscape is virtual Antonioni so it may not appeal to viewers who  are not familiar with the director's works. One of his greatest works  (L'Avventura remains his best to me). The only problem is the DVD transfer.  I've seen the VHS and it has a consistent hue of orange. The DVD, although  sharper and clearer, fluctuates in hues from blues in medium shots to reds  and oranges in long shots. For a film that essentially deals with color (it  was Antonioni's first color feature), the transfer was rather clumsy and  careless. The sound is average but leaves a lot of room for improvement.  Why didn't Criterion handle the transfer of this gorgeous film	1
B000062XG2:this_movie_is_for_people_who_love_books:m._fisher	This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?	1
B000F3TAOE:fantastic!__mind_blowing!:p._vonmende_"opera_lover"	This is the best "La Traviata."  I was so moved that I had to take a break.  It really touched me deeply!	1
B00062IVOY:stroke_of_genius:mary_w._mcdowell_"movie_lover"	I'm not a golfing buff, but found the story and golf very good.	1
B0000560Y4:how_much_is_enough?:paulo_andre	It seems to me there's a certain type of photographic quality in most of the 80s movies that sets them apart from any other era. I'm not arguing it's either better or worse than others, it just feels different and very distinctive. In this light, "Wall Street" reminded me vividly of "No Way Out" for instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several De Palma films. Don't ask me why. It just does.	1
B00003CXXY:delicate_and_dazzling:mark_a._rosenbaum_"mrosenbaum75"	This movie is intimate and special. Some reviews say it is the story of obsession, of fetishism, of trivial things. However, this movie is the story of something special in a young teenage boy's life: his fantasy woman.	1
B000059HAP:the_animal_kingdom:ms._aj_"right"	The Truth About Cats and Dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable, refreshing movie. Janeane Garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical, depressed, miserable, pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want.	1
6305079803:excellent_presentation:flazatty_"flazatty"	Excellent presentation and goes into detail, much of which may be unknown to the viewer.  One minor criticism:  the participants let Stanley Lord of the Californian off much too easily	1

I thought Kat Williams Live was great, but this one was better!  His tell it like it is and living life approach is great. If you can't go to see him in a live performance this is the next best thing. Be prepared to laugh so hard your sides ache.  Keep an open mind and go for the ride!	1

B0009OUBC4:a_week_in_the_life_of_a_serial_killer:cicada_"brodadaktylos_eos!"	Just today I randomly selected a movie, that movie was "Henry".  I had never heard of it before, and I figured that I was in for your average, run-of-the-mill low budget slasher flick.  Though it is low budget, it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie.  In fact, the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study.	1
B000244EOW:back_to_life:michael_mueller	This is a thuroughly enjoyable movie; a pleasure to watch. THe acting, characters, and story are entirely plausible, and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors, nor is there any of Hollywood's usual political preachiness (especially unusual considering Robert Redford's backing).	1
B0002DB59A:very_sweet:thenorthworld	I loved the artistic topics of Art & Music in this particular Little People DVD.  And I have to say, this is one of our favorites.  But I do agree with the other reviewer about the duplicate episodes showing up in each DVD.  If you have other LP movies, then you will feel slightly dissapointed to see the episodes repeating themselves here and there.  I also agree that the menu setup could be better, with all 10 episodes playing back-to-back, rather than split into 5 at a time the way they currently are.  Otherwise, this is still a great DVD - much better than the LP Storytime Collection	1
B000K7UHF6:impressive:axeslinger0u812_"axeslinger0u812"	AFI finally release a live DVD, and as a portrayal of the band as it stands now, it is very impressive. It does lack older, more hardcore punk tracks, but that is to be expected as the band grows and matures into the  band it is now. Each album progresses towards more epic scales, and songs balance beauty with power. "I Heard a Voice" captures this on film, and the fan gets to witness AFI at their most grandiose. Watching vocalist Davey Havok sing "God Called in Sick Today" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime. The masterful command of theatrics from each member, especially Havok, creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate. The setlist itself is perfectly put together, with the only gripe being the exclusion of "Kiss and Control." The rest of the songs display all facets of AFI, from the fast paced "Dancing Through Sunday",(which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist Jade Puget) "Kill Caustic", "Death of Seasons", "Totalimmortal" and "A Single Second", (the last of which features a guest appearance by Nick 13 of Tiger Army) to the slower paced "This Time Imperfect" and "Endlessly, She Said" as well as all of their recent singles, and a few more cuts from their latest releases "Decemberunderground" and "Sing the Sorrow". Extras are geared towards the fans, with Despair Faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the Decemberunderground release, as well as a poster.	1

B0007XBMSO:brilliant_-_elvis_keeps_getting_better!:s._rundell	Firstly, don't let the DVD Region 1 status put you off - I am in Australia and this disc played perfectly on my PC, DVD Player and even the PS2! It's wonderful to finally see an intimate performance by Elvis Costello on DVD! It brought so many memories of his tour in 2004 back to me. Elvis Fans will love this DVD featuring his latest music, along with many oldies, it is very rare to get up close and personal with this man! Elvis gives 100% of himself on stage! A must for your music DVD collection	1
B000OVLC0W:the_lesbian_classic_that_raised_the_bar!:iryshkidd	This is the definitive lesbian love story that launched the genre in a new direction.  Out of the dirty bars and masculine flannel shirts, away from the creepy angst of punks.  This wonderful love story brings lesbian love into the light of day with beautiful women, looking and acting sexy, and leading productive, respectable lives.  WHY NOT portray lesbians as beautiful, educated, clean, classy, talented, sober, drug-free, non-violent, non-"self-destructive", straight forward, honest...oh, and truly SEXY??  The Reno landscape in the 50's is a great backdrop for the conflicts that lesbians encountered.  The filming is top notch, the sets and period clothing are spot on.  The musical scores are superb!	1
B0000WN0WS:excellent_live_worship_dvd!:rnorton828_"rnorton828"	This live DVD was released as a companion to Randy Travis' "Worship & Faith" CD.  The concert was recorded on July 15, 2003 at Calvary Assmebly God Church in Orlando, Florida.  Here, Travis delivers many of the songs from the W&F album, plus "Pray for the Fish" and his country radio hit "Three Wooden Crosses."  Comments from Travis and from several fans are added in between songs.  Like its audio companion, this DVD contains a great mix of classic hymns, camp meeting songs and contemporary worship songs.  Some of the highlights include "You Are Worthy of My Praise," "Just a Closer Walk with Thee," "We Fall Down" and "Open the Eyes of My Heart."  Other noteworthy tracks include "Shall We Gather at the River," "Peace in the Valley," "Above All" and "Love Lifted Me."  Travis closes the show with "Three Wooden Crosses," the first song recorded on a Christian music label to ever top the country music charts.  "Worship & Faith" is a great DVD for lovers of worship music, lovers of country music, as well as for any and every Randy Travis fan.  This is an excellent DVD	1

B0002J4X1Q:fun_to_watch_over_and_over_again:gamerarocks_"captpicardfan"	Like many that have seen this movie, I have been a fan of the video game series for years, and this movie never disappoints me. It has everything that makes RE great; strong characters, interesting story and scenes that make me jump. At first, it is sad that no video game characters make it on to this movie, but Milla Jovovich is great as the heroine Alice.	1
B00011RPB0:a_very_memorable_film_:devin_mcnally_"mcdevster"	We all feel alone at times... this is something 'lost in translation' brilliantly shows its audience.. Indeed loneliness often, paradoxically, occurs in highly populated areas.. It is as if the more people we are surrounded by the more alienated we feel - the more our differences stand out... Bill Murray is superbly cast as the outsider celebrity guy, who dosen't seem to quite know why he is where he is, and why he is treated the way he is - in a culture and a pace of life so distant from his way of seeing and experiencing reality.. This is a very promosing feature from sofia coppola.. It captures hotel life in a way that only direct experiene could top.. This also sort of represents the zenith of Bill murray's career and perhaps his best performance to date.	1
B0007X9TK2:scooby_sports!!!!:	This DVD is way cool with a buch of sport themed episodes. First Scooby and the gang help a baseball hero break a home run record, but the ghost of Cab Crag isn't too happy about having his record broken.  Then they compete in a off road race with a giant worm as a competitor - and what's with the worm worshipers -I mean they go like whoo "a giant worm is our god, whoo we hate cars".   Then they go to the Bocephus wrestling facility.  Could they come up with a better name than Bocephus?  There's a really freaky creature which may scare your little sister.  The last episode is, by far, the best.  A hockey ghost is terrorizing the World Cup Hockey event. He's one of the toughest ghosts ever, either that, or the Russian Police are the biggest whimps ever!  I think this DVD is a good buy if you are a Scooby fan, just be prepared, it can get a little goofy.	1

29607	I used a 25 pack of these doing DVD backups, and the last 5 or so failed. I thought it was my software, so I got new software. Guess what? My first disc out of the new package of 25 that I bought failed, too.  It's not my burner (as another reviewer suggested, implying that people should learn to read), as it's brand new and doesn't require the firmware upgrade they mention. They just suck and have a high failure rate.  So the consensus seems to be that TDK or Sony are best. I'm buying some now and save myself the frustration	0

78004	You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous	0
91851	This is the worst thing I have ever owned!!!! It broke (said there were no cd's inside) after about a week! Do yourself a favor don't get this product, don't buy this brand and don't buy from sears they sucked about the whole thing too	0
120341	The card worked fine for my son's graduation and a family holiday but became corrupted during my brother's wedding and I lost all the photos from that event.  I still can't believe it happened.  If you have an iPod, or other, remember to back-up your photos as soon as you can to try and avoid this	0
141452	i've given it 2 stars instead of 0 because after i used this CD, the sound from my system did seem to be a little better (the CD's were not skipping as much).  but the bottom line is it didn't fix the problem as the CDs are still skipping noticeably, although not as bad as before.  ... not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a 6-disk CD changer	0
149657	The LCD is easier to use than the earlier version that relied on audio clips to switch frequency. You may have to experiment a good deal to find a position where the signal reaches the car radio adequately, like the 1960s rabbit ears tv antennas. Even then, if you are in an are with good FM radio coverage it's going to be hard to find a frequency where this will work. Mostly you can't use this with a cover on and you'll need a car charger if you want to use it for long. The all-in-one modulator and charger that clips to the docking connector is a better solution	0
183797	I bought this stereo because of its relatively small size and stylish appearance and because it had aux inputs for me to hook up my mp3 player to it.	0
191238	This was a great mouse for about the first year I owned. After one year is when all of the problems started.  The mouse now loses connection sproadically and sometimes it doesn't want to connect at all.  I have changed the battery quite a few times and that doesn't seem to help.  It is very tempremental, and I have now given up and am shopping for a replacement.	0

245085	I have had this printer for more than a year.  At first, it was a great printer. Not anymore!!  It uses up ink like no other, yes, it is great to have the individual tanks(which is why I bought the thing) but now the print head isn't working right.  Do several deep cleanings and use up nearly all the full tanks up, and the problem is still there.  The pages have splotchy black marks and the texts are only partially printed.  Went to the canon website, they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed.	0
264296	Very unreliable .......... I have used DVD RW and CD RW Memorex disks on multiple computers and DVD recorders.  I find that they.....1) don't last....get about 50 re-recordings NOT 1500  2) may crap out on any occasion.......multiple CD RW's with critical material would NOT read on multiple computers.	0
271498	I bought this mouse eight months ago and was quite satisfied - until last week when it stopped functioning altogether.  I really expected a better product and durability from Microsoft.  I've since bought a Logitech VX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks and love it.	0
285980	I had no problems burning to these discs, its when I went back a few months later to these discs and found out that none of them work anymore. After further research I found out that Memorex uses the cheapest dye available and thus the DVDs have absolutelly no life to them, my discs started dying after a few months.	0
289749	As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better	0
298312	When this adapter first arrived, I thought it was great. The sound quality was excellent, and free of all the distortion and interference I get from using an FM transmitter-style adapter (there are few open frequencies in the SF Bay Area). The first day, I used it for about 20 minutes total (didn't have far to drive), and it worked great. The second day I had a bit farther to drive. After about 30 minutes, it quit. Hasn't worked again since.	0
334104	In theory an excellent product -- room for lots of disks, relatively compact and attractive HOWEVER I purchased three of these (2 for me 1 for a friend) I can't say how his is doing but both of mine have faulty zippers, making  it impossible to close the binders and therefore losing much of their attractiveness and compactness. (...). All in all, a disappointment	0
350586	I bought this item not to cool my laptop, but to provide some insulation from the heat when it's on my lap sitting in a chair. I'm very satisfied with it's being able to accomplish that. HOWEVER, the cord ended up breaking after a few months. Targus replaced it at no charge which is good, but still a hassle. Now one of the two fans has started making a racket when I first turn it on. After a bit it settles down but very noisy at first.	0
382805	What a crock as it looks like everyone else got good product and good service!  I got a shuffle and something happened the second time I tried to load music to make it not even play.  I took it to the Apple Store in Mall of America (Minneapolis, MN) and they claimed to know there was an issue and claimed to have fixxed it.  I go back home (OK) and it still does not work.  Apple said for $113 they'll fix.  Gee thanks!  I'll be looking at another brand!  Apple stinks	0

495754	This thing was slipping and sliding all over the place and I constantly had to readjust in so the functions were in place.  The slot on the top that is supposed to allow you to use the "hold" feature is completely off so you end up having to stretch the thing over to turn it on and off.  The little plastic protector that covers the screen would not stay in place over the screen and I was constantly losing it between the silicon cover and the ipod.  I finally just gave up on it and returned it.  I bought it because it is one of the only ipod accessories that has a fair price tag.  I think I'll just get it over with and buy one of the more expensive options.  Was this thing even meant for the Gen 2 nano	0
512534	Wasted my money for this SLOW hub...	0
520407	I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice	0

Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else	0

601201	The player stopped working after only a few months - it would accept DVDs but not play them and refuse to eject them.  That behavior started out as intermittent, but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a DVD and never let go.  We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash.  Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.  This one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether - what a waste.  Save your time and money and buy another machine	0
B000HHOD5O:junk,_junk,_junk-stay_away:p._c._schaefer	I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed.	0

It has been nothing but a lemon since I got it. Often when I turn it on it has lines going across the screen and has to be turned off and then on again to get rid of them. The graffiti is terrible and rarely works. I have to reset it all the time. Customer support is terrible and did nothing to rectify the problems. I even sent it to them at one point and they sent it back in exactly the same condition I sent it to them. I don't think they even looked at it. After my experience with this Palm, I will never buy Palm again	0
B00001W0DT:does_this_work_with_desktop_pcs?:seshadri_g	I purchased this and shipped to US and finally had it delivered to India in gurgaon. Iam a musician and I desperately wanted a good microphone. I record my violin pieces on my laptop and used an ordinary computer mike for this. But I wanted a more sensitive recording and couldnt believe the dismal output of this mike. The gain was lower than the ordinary mike, it doesnt work at all without the battery, but the sound is tiny and totally unsatisfactory. Unfortunately sony doesnt have good service centres who'll entertain me in delhi and I consider 70 bucks down the drain. :&lt;..	0

B0001JXAUW:be_very_careful:joltar	I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work	0

Also, the only content I can play on this set-top box is content that comes through iTunes? That's right. if it isn't in your iTunes library, you can play it on the Apple TV. This means you caqn play your DVD's, you cant't play saved DVD, iMovie, or other movie files, you can't play anything unless it has been successfully;y added to your iTunes library. Also, make sure you see the fine print about having to have a widescreen TV. they aren't joking about this. If you don't have one, you can still use this item but it will show up as a frame about half the size of your screen (it won't go to the edges and be borderless) so you have a tiny window to view inside a large black box.	0

B000BM946S:what_a_let_down_._._._:c._burnside_"jabba_jaw"	I purchased this MP3 player thinking it was a good purchase.  Boy was I wrong.  Creative Labs tend to have glitches whether it be computer hardware, software, or other products like this one.  Now having problems with the product is one thing, but customer service is lousy and they could give a rats [...].  Also when I ordered seperate batteries from their online store they mentioned AFTER I purchased their product that it was going to be delayed for an extra month.  My MP3 player stopped working after 3 months, I did get it to work again.  Two months later the screen told me I had hardware problems.  OK, so I download the drivers that is supposed to fix the problem, no go.  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I am working in Eastern Europe at the time so it makes matters even better trying to get ahold of them via phone.	0
B0001OY2VS:it's_crap:c._sanders	These are some of the worst ear buds I have heard since the very first ones came out. Voices are muted, highs are muddy, and lows are non-existant.

B000100EG4:unbelievably_bad:keith_s._thomas_"keefie3"	Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.	0
B000EINRA8:misleading_prior_eton_e-5_review:harry_n._joe	Just received radio yesterday, and am returning radio today! Pluses.... adequate LCD display and good illumination while on AC adapter. Good thumbwheel tuning in 1 Khz increments. Adequate speaker fidelity for small radio. However, the volume slew buttons have set "numbered" volume levels, and between settings of 5-6, there is a BIG noticeable increase in volume(not good), and while tuning shortwave bands, every approx 100Khz increment, there appears to be a "null" area, where signal meter reads a signal received, but quiet speaker. Also, on FM, if hands are near the radio, the signal breaks up(for weaker signals, not strong ones), and compared to my Grundig 400-PE, which I feel the sensitivity is not good and the hiss is bothersome, the Eton E-5 seems worse still!!! I am returning this today, and obtaining the Sony 7600GR instead. Eton E-5, not bad, but certainly not worth 3 stars or above, especially, if comparing it to another similar size radio, and then comparing it to my Sony 2010.	0
B000ALGKEO:warning!!!:g._wallace	After owning a P-touch labeler for years,I found the need for a more duable label than my "M" tape was providing. I opted for this "TZ" tape labeler. Good price,looks good. What a mistake!!! The only thing well designed about this unit is it's abilty to waste more tape than it uses!! If you print a label of any size,count on it costing you two full inches of tape to do it!!! At $20.00 a roll,prepare to be screwed each time you push the print button.Then go find the scissors and cut the excess off,so the label does not look as stupid as the person who designed this pile of junk!!! But cheer up you can push six buttons,every time,to reduce the margin to "narrow". This will reduce the waste to a half inch on ONE side of the label,and print two small dots on the other side,this will show you where to cut it with your scissors,to match the "narrow" side. Also you must do ALL settings for EVERY label EVERY time!!Another "great feature,it will use the same amount of tape regaurdless of print size,so you will only print large print.What a joke!!! What a hassle!! Now the good news. I used to make lots of labels,and now I only make labels for VERY important items. And only when I am up to getting mad for doing so. I really wish amazon would allow us to give items a negative five stars! You have been warned	0

B0002YGLDY:terrible_product:rebecca_j._dimatteo	I bought this product to replace a previous HP all-in-one printer I had.  This is by far the worst printer I have ever owned.

B0009PD3KU:expensive,_doesn't_work_with_plain_paper_and_ink_is_painful_to_find.:dwayne_d._russell	The Epson R2400 is a purely Photo Printer. Be sure to understand this before you buy. So if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it  . . . think again. The K3 inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted. It took three calls to Epson and replacing the ICC profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the K3 ink compatibility with the plain paper. All the magazines raved about the Black and White printing quality. NOT. At least not on Premium Quality Photo Paper. Perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers. I saw very little improvement over my Epson R320. Now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer. The biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as Staples. The in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore. This is Hint #1. Hint #2 if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for Monday you are SOL. The only option you have is to order the ink online. Trust Amazon as they can find and deliver. However if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges. Cartridges certainly dont last very long and at $12-$15 each with eight of them your burning $100-$125 a set. Bulk ink tanks are coming out but I doubt the K3 Inks will be imitated. IF you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you. However at $850 I fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper. I haven't been happy with this printer and I plan to replace it soon. Amazon's being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here.	0

B00005T3NH:don't_be_fooled:jh	I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth	0

How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!

B000B63RJE:run_away!:kurt_j._daghita_"code_over_load"	This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.

B000KURO9K:really_disappointed_with_viamichelin_x-930_gps:mark_l._bradford_"drmbradford"	I really tried to like the Via Michelin, bought it with every intention of loving it in March 2007.  But I feel compelled to tell most of you to "keep shopping."  I bought it due to the excellent price, small thin size(compared to Garmin). I thought "how bad can it be?"  I ordered it and had it shipped to my door, then took off on a 3400 mile trip with it.  This is because my other GPS units were in other cars, with other family members already on other trips. I bought this one as a budget GPS, optimistic that it was new and had the Sirf-III chip.  But before long, I hated this unit, all the criticms of other reviews came back to haunt me, and I will tell you about it below.	0
B000AZ2BAW:very_dissapointed:dds_"honest_user"	I have never written a review like this before but felt compelled to do so in this case. Those considering purchase of this printer should be aware that the claim that it will work with pict bridge connections is NOT true. I purchased this for my wife thinking that it would be a nice compact simple printer to operate where we could easily print pictures of the grandkids. She and I both have newer Nikon digitals and the pictbridge connection will not work with mine at all. With hers, we can make a connection and, following drections carefully, we can get it to 'energize' the printer but the printer will only print intermittent photos and not of good quality. The printer will not pull the paper though properly. (We have even changed batteries in the camera to no avail and had a tech savvy son-in-law look at it.) I read reviews by others, but feel this printer is simply not reliable. I wanted to share our bad experience with those of you evauating a purchase.	0

B000E0IW1A:product_didnt_work_right_and_company_wouldnt_back_it_up:jake_a_hicks_"jk"	Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too	0

I really did enjoy the ease of Tivo from Pre-HD days and wanted to go back from my Comcast HD DVR.  I then saw the pricetag and, unlike the other people... I can NOT justify spending that much money for a DVR!  It is definitely not worth it for something I get for $8 extra a month attached to my cable service.  Yes... i do love the Tivo interface and searching, but I will not pay that much for it.  It feels like business suicide for Tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price.  Knock $700 dollars off that retail price and I might change my mind	0
B000HC0BJG:mine_was_faulty_and_some_other_notes:e._weatherbee	Most annoying thing is that I hooked up through HDMI for 2 of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the HDMI (I used optical). What the hell is the deal with that? At first I thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your TV or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well. HDMI is supposed to make it more convenient, 1 cable etc... why is this necessary???????	0

When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage.  The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted.

However, I was able to Jury-rig an acceptable if less than pretty compromise.  I ordered the Friction mount, removed the screws on the bottom, detaching the mounts that would not fit my Nuvii, and stapled velcro strips purchased at Walmart across the base of the suction cup into the friction mount.  I have been cross country using this system and it works.  the Garmin Portable Friction Mount for GPS 010-10306-00 combined with the suction cup is a much better solution than the cup by itself	0
B000GDLMNK:no_ipod_controls!!_bulky!:j._samuel	This device is much bulkier than it needs to be. But an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod. The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod.

I have both the the DL-150 Pentax Battery that came with the camera and the Impact IMDL150. I can't tell any difference between them other than the price.

B000FH375I:not_worth_the_trouble_or_money!!!:c._cavanaugh_"nav_photog"	This product is not worth the money or trouble.  I also had problem with bubbles forming and also the sides curing up as my notebook warmed up.  It was too much bother to keep trying to smooth out the bubbles and press down the sides after curling back up.  Save your money and don't buy this. This would actually qualify for a zero star rating	0
B000ELSZBQ:pain_in_the_a**!:r._mertz_"stokes_bites"	Awesome concept, however I live in an apartment that doesn't have any south facing windows, so I was unable to get a signal.  I strongly advise against calling the XM radio help # from a phone that won't use up your cell phone minutes.  Had to call them four different times, and all they did was read me the instruction manual, and tell me that if I don't have signal my radio won't work (I had clearly established that fact already).  I recieved the radio for free because of a rebate, and didn't even intend on getting XM radio, but figured since the unit was free, and an MP3 player, to give it a try.   I was going to break down and buy the $70 car kit but then I ran across the AGT sportscaster for $20, which came with a car kit.  Since I can't use it in my house, I hook up the home base to the car kit, and at least I can use it that way.  This ended up being a lot of work for something I wasn't sure I wanted in the first place.  Haven't used the MP3 player yet, but napster does not seem the most user friendly.

B000HS2TYA:less_than_honest_representation:w._eisele	I bought this to work with my eMac/700.  It met all of the system requirements given.  What wasn't said was that it wasn't supported by the Mac's 10.3.9 operating system and would only work while running the Toast 6 lite.  In other words I couldn't read or write disks from any other application on the Mac.  In fact it would immediately eject the disk when I quit Toast.	0
B000FCA0K8:very_poor_handset_volume:tim	If you want to talk to some that is soft spoken you better not be using the ATT5995 or Handset590-3. Turn the handset volume up all the way and you will still be looking for more, not even close. I do not have a hearing problem, but this phone had me thinking I did. The speakerphone volume is loud enough but very poor quality.	0
B0007RPW2C:dont'_buy_this_junk:joisey	I purchased my 500 in September, it's now January and it has never worked correctly at all. It would say that I am in Russia, then lock up (I live in NJ USA). The first time that I sent it it, my expense, Magellan support sent it back to me within 24 hours; and it was not fixed. It still said that I was in Russia and would lock up. The second time that I sent it to them, they sent me a shipping label via email. They had it in their paws for about 2 weeks. It came back said that I was in Peru and then lock up. I have an old Lowrance and never had a problem receiving a signal, it always locked on to my location (albeit a little slow), and it worked.	0
B000088NO4:do_not_buy_the_dvc-1100!:d._schmidt_"--_tech_geek_&_gadget_shopaholic"	I have to admit, the main reason I purchased (2) of these DVC-1100's was because of the stellar reviews posted here on Amazon.  I bought one for my in-laws and on for my wife and I so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance.  Great idea, bad solution.  The main problem I had was that the camera lens is fixed, and does NOT focus.  I waited 1 hour on the line with D-LINK tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately 6 - 8 feet away from the camera.  Unfortunately, the ones I got did not focus at all, and the video quality was absolutely terrible (washed out color and bad contrast).  Please listen to me, save your money and do not buy the DVC-1100.  This device is cheaply made, and just not there yet..	0
B00006HO35:seems_a_good_idea,_but_poorly_put_togeter:edward_h._pitts_"sculptor-tinkerer"	I purchased 16 of the Allsop 26625 DVD/VHS Organizers. After I had 4 or 5 of them on the floor, loaded with DVDs, I was going to move them to load the next batch. But, when I picked them up off the floor, two of them came apart, dropping the DVDs on the floor. Knowing they were weak, I tried to hold the next one together, but pressed a little too hard on opposite corners; the other two corners gave way, and my hands came together, scattering DVDs all over the floor.	0

B0000CO2UT:same_problems_as_all_of_the_above_users:blue_eyes_"music_lover"	My CD player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above. I called the Harman Kardon customer service line, and they kept me on hold for ten minutes. Then I went to their website, which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics. The website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to Harman. I had to do that three times to get a response. Finally I got a return authorization after two days and several emails. Poor quality, poor customer support. Guess what H-K, I won't be buying any of your products in the future. This is a replacement for a Sony changer that worked flawlessly for 18 years. And, I may take HK to small claims court if the replacement doesn't work.	0
B000AY8DDW:not_a_terrific_value:mark_stieglitz	I thought I was getting a terrific deal on 6 ink tanks, they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually.  But when I later bought a one-off replacement -- not "custom" -- tank I noticed the ink level bar on the printer LCD was not only full but also longer than the other bars!  If the "custom" tanks hold only about half the ink, this isn't the bargin it appears	0
B0007Y6ACQ:serious_drop_in_quality:kt	I have always been a fan of Sony because they make quality products that are "user-friendly".

B000CR3HEW:awful_sound_-_stay_away:john_t._powers	I have always bought and liked Uniden phones.  Tried this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation and because I wanted caller ID.  AWFUL reception - too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line.  Turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice.  Good range (which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call!).  Stay clear!!!!!!	0
B000EMDOD4:annoying;_bad_quality:rebalboa_"fanatique_de_la_musique"	This transmitter requires me to remove the case from my iPod 5G.  Even with the case removed the device doesn't fit snugly and works it way loose as I am driving.  The sound is fair even though the area where I live has many unused stations.  I would think it would sound much better than it does.  Poor quality product; has too many flaws to justify the high price.  I'm very disappointed and I'm returning it	0
B0009X0CSI:mac_owners...._run:carmen_nicholls	It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru	0
B000F2KRGK:needs_to_go_to_rehab_for_its_ink_drinking_problem:kyla_williams	This printer sucks! It started out working wonderfully. Then all of a sudden (after the third month in use) it started printing very slowly. Then it decided it wouldn't print at all unless I completely shut down my computer everytime. Something is wrong when you can only get 200 sheets of paper out of text only documents from the black ink cartridge. It also uses the color ink when it's not requested. I only needed the color ink a couple of times (not for pictures) and it went just as fast as the black. I used to love hp. They are now making garbage. I'm thinking of looking at the OKI brand. Don't waste your money on this one	0
B000KX28CA:would_be_great_if_it_was_usable:r._lawson	I was excited to receive the product however it did not fit my laptop.  Everytime I opened the lid a POPPING sound would occur.

B0007RPW22:for_wilderness_use:israel_holby	I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness.	0

If ANY of them is out of ink, you can't print at all.  If you're out of yellow ink, you still cannot print a purely black/white document!!

B000H12IAC:works_as_good_as_their_software!:james_allen_"moogy"	I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment.  I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM).  In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision.  On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector.  This is with Vista x64.  I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund.  Rumor has it MS is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard.	0

However, Amazon.com was very quick and gracious in the return.	0
B0009FUAQ0:poorly_made:drmike	I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony.....	0
B000JKHXRO:cord_design_terrible_but_the_sound_is_good:s._heckel	The cord design of these is terrible.  You'll have about 6 inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about 20 inches from  your right ear to your attachment point.  This is especially agravating for RIGHT HANDED individual (pshh hardly any of those).  Why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your mp3 player (or whatever) in your left hand as the normal cord is too short.  I always use the extra extended cable, which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use.	0

B0002X85PC:low_on_features,_mediocre_performance.:joseph_m._wilson	This little scanner is not worth the price. It's got a very limited user interface making it very slow and aggravating to use. There is no possible way to directly input a specific frequency, large gaps in between the frequency ranges it's programmed to receive, and very limited memory capabilities. The small display is hard to read unless you are directly in front of the device, looking from any angle and the backlit LCD display is unreadable.	0

B000E5BKP0:painful_set-up,_poor_range:j._w_wendt	Having had very good luck with two Belkin G routers, I thought that the G+ would be a no-brainer. NOT. First of all, the router would not install at all from Windows 2000. I called customer support, and after interminable waits and two tech support people (who were very polite), we finally decided to install from another computer with Windows XP. All seemed to be going along fine--the router installed--but did not allow me to set a security password for the wireless in the regular set-up process like their G-router setups did. Only when I logged on wirelessly, it let me set a password----meaning had any of my bandwidth-thieving neighbors tried to log on before me, it would have been THEM setting MY password (which would have effectively locked me out of the wireless!). It also came without a user's guide (though that is listed on the box contents) and the CD-ROM also was supposed to have a user's manual, but when I clicked on the "user manual" tab, nothing came up! After all was said and done, I did manage to get my XP system connected, but the Windows 2000 would not connect even with a cable (it was working fine on a Linksys direct cable before). Overall--a very painfully long installation that was not Windows 2000-compatible (or perhaps a firewall problem), items left out of the package, and a big step down in ease of installation from their G router. And if that isn't bad enough--the signal strength was no improvement over the Linksys G router I was replacing. Belkin, sorry--this product was below your previous standard. This one's going back to Best Buy	0
B0001V2MY0:interlink_remotepoint_is_poorly_designed:joachim_isaac	I've owned three of Interlink's units, but that was before  competitors came to market with well-designed units. The Interlink pointer plastic casing is flimsy and cracks easily;  there is no OFF switch to prevent the laser from accidentally coming on when the unit is packed or placed in one's pocket; the advance and go-back buttons function most of the time, but on average miss and have to be pushed a second or third time at least 2-3 times per 30 minute presentation.  Although I agree with many of the points made by other reviewers who score this Interlink product better than I do, it seems these other reviewers have not compared the Interlink pointer with competing pointers that have identical features. For example, the Kensington pointer is half the price; the case is sturdy, has a no-slip outer coating, has a comfortable feel in the hand, and even includes a trench that serves as a holder for the receiver when not in use.  Placing the receiver in this trench automatically disconnects the laser so that batteries do not have to be removed when packing the unit for a trip.  And the advance and go-back buttons function all of the time, not just most of the time!	0
B00069FEVA:terrible_product:ashley_person_"k._xandria"	This tv only worked for three weeks.  Then, for no apparant reason, it suddenly would not turn on.  I sent it back to Coby for servicing and they sent it back still broken and with a new crack on it.  No one should by from Coby	0
B000J13TEE:big_disapointment:marvin_volz	Along with reception of new HD stations I expected high quality FM & AM to go with my complete top line stereo system. Instead, the HDT-1 gives me very poor quality, even less than a table-top clock radio. Very high output - can only turn amp up to lowest level - and painful to listen to. No response to inquiries from Sangean.	0
B000H11RUY:hdtv_on_pc:david_c._jones	The card works and produces a reasonable image, but the "Catalyst" software used to drive the card is lacking/buggy.  To make work, I had to disable the SCSI CD burner in the system (or the software would hang for several minutes before working).  The sofware is slow to open/respond, beyond that the ability to size the TV window is very limited.  This card replaced a standard TV card in my system that I bought for $25.  I used the old card more because it would open quickly and I could resize the window to be small (non intrusive) while I was working on other things.  On the plus size, I can expand the HDTV card to larger windows while retaining a good image	0
B00061ZM2Y:frustrating_for_this_vocalist:m._galvin_"meathena2"	I'm not the most gadget inclined person, and this was given to me as a gift because it was easy to install and use.  But I have to say I've had a lot of frustration with this device because the gain for the mic input is tweaked out - it's either OFF or ON, but there's not much gradation between the two.  In fact I get almost no gain at all until I reach almost the "3:00" position on the dial.  And then it's a LOT, and my vocals tend to clip out with the slightest volume variation.  It basically keeps me locked into soft, close singing, and a girl can't do that all the time!  Other than that I haven't had any problems, but that one almost renders it useless.  I don't know if there's something more reliable (and sane) out there, but if there is, go for that instead.  Even if it costs more.  Why spend money on something that doesn't work	0

B000FCN9TM:how_to_trash_$200_in_90_days:seung_jun_yoo	For the first few weeks it worked fine, however, it started skipping and stopping DVDs after two months. I called customer service on 85th days after original purchase date and been told to send the unit for replacement since it was still under warranty, no case number was given at the time. The unit was shipped via UPS and received on 92nd days from the purchase date, and they charged $50 for warranty service since it was received two days after warranty expired. I called customer service again and the representative declined waiving charges because I don't have case number issued within warranty period. In addition, please keep in mind that their service fee includes returning handling and shipping fees as well. Next place for my DVD player? Trashcan *sigh*	0

B0001OHH06:poor_radio,_small_buttons:cal	I purchased the Rino 130 specifically because it also had the  radio and NOAA features.  Fortunately I read the other reviews on this model as well as the 120 and 110 versions that complained about poor radio performance. I tested the unit and sure enough the radio performance is absolutely terrible, and I was able to return the unit to Amazon in time for a full refund.  Be sure to test this yourself.  Also the buttons are very small, and the zoom function is impractical as you constantly have to activate the zoom and then slide the zoom level up and down.  I returned the Rino 130 and purchased a Garmin Etrex Legend C (color display) for about the same price.  I will miss the NOAA feature of the 130 but not the radio.  This is an overpriced GPS.  Spend the money on a color display unit instead and you will not be disappointed	0
B000AYWP18:defective_design:m._shaw	This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless. The carrying case does not comply with the measurements of the device itself. The ONLY way to insert the device into the limited size and shape of this carrying case would be to cut the case wide open with scissors. Even if one could somehow manage to squeeze an iAudio into the tiny case, the designers forgot to install an opening for the charger. I returned mine immediately. If you order this item you will be frustrated with a poorly designed, ill-fitting, unacceptable piece of worthless junk	0

118161	I installed this unit on my HP AMD 64 X2 with a 19-inch LCD monitor.  Installation was very straightforward, with no problems experienced.  The unit has two rows of power outlets - eight outlets total.  All are surge protected, but only one row has battery backup.  Each row includes an outlet that is offset to allow transformer power supplies to be connected and still accommodate use of the other outlets.  The unit also surge protects the incoming telephone line, and interacts well transparently my DSL service.	1
137988	I got this card last month and I've been using it heavily. Its been great. Its sturdy and can has great range. There are a few problems though.	1
147639	I, like many other people that have written reviews here, researched the purchase of an MP3 player in great detail.  Other members of my family own iPods, and that is the direction that I was heading until I did a massive amount of research.  If you want to rip the thousands of songs that you already own on CD, this is the unit that you want.  iPod will not let you download your own songs, I did not know that until after I purchased this player (thankfully).  This unit was the highest rated unit by far that I was able to scour the internet for.  If this is your first purchase of an MP3 player (like mine) buy this one, no questions asked.  Do not worry about trying to buy $80 ear buds the sound from the ear buds that come with the player is unreal.  Crisp, clear, awsome base and I have only turned up the player to 23 on the volume it goes up to 40.  I cannot hear the home stereo that my wife is listening to or my kids that are running around the house playing.  I received this player in the mail today at 5:30 when I got home from work and by 6:35 I have transfered the 114 artists folders (about 4,000+ songs) that I had ripped on my computer last week (about 35 to 40 minutes to transfer the music to the staging folder and then to the player).	1

187575	Excellent value -- these batteries are just as good as name brands for about half the price.  If you use a lot of AA's, this is the way to go -- made especially nice if you use them as a filler to get your shipping free on your entire order if it is hovering in the $18 range	1
208163	This appears to be a good piece of equipment. I hav'nt had any major outages as of yet but a minor fluctuation was handled very well.	1
232963	I bought this 2 years back and still it is in great shape. Recently i forgot compact flash in my shirt pocket and went for washing and then followed by Drying. My wife found compact flash in dryer and i thought it would not work. Surprisingly it is working fine and i could see my past snapshots with out any problem.	1
246675	I,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you "must" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice	1
257136	IT's a USB hub. All I ask is that it works. It does.	1
277934	I've never had any problems with Memorex DVD's or CD's. When I was ordering and read some of the reviews here, I had to go back and look at what I was using to make sure. I've always taken it for granted and only posted this review to counteract some of the negative ones. I don't know why some users are having problems, but these DVD's always worked great for me, and I record on average over one a day	1
291145	I've had this card for about 1 1/2 years now and it has performed flawlessly. It has seen thousands of photos (no exaggeration!) on my digital camera and now holds data/mp3s for my palm too. Did you know you can pop your SD card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos? I just learned this. Anyway it's a nice product and I'm about to get another SimpleTech with 512 megs or higher if they have one. If you are new to SD memory, always get more storage than you need because eventually you'll buy something that will use one (camera, handhelds, cell phones, etc. -- note that many cell phones use a smaller "MiniSD")	1
308563	Must say that the item was better than I expected. Thanks to the seller and will buy again!!!	1
339376	I read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn't so sure about it.  However, after buying and trying it out, I have no regrets.  Don't know why I waited soo long to get one (dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one).  Although made of plastic, it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding.  The clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold.  Unlike other models, this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books.  I have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem	1
349554	This is a good compact flash card.  This is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive.	1
360409	The initial flash card that came with my camera was far too short to save pictures.  When I went surfing for another flash card with some depth, Amazon really came through for me and the price was excellent.	1
369286	easiest remote to program. has tremendous ability to tweek. will keep recommending to all my customers	1

391083	I love my 2 GB SD memory card. I use it all the time and have had no problems with it	1
425248	I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office.  the reception on this unit is great.  Bieng in a steel building she is able to get all the local radio stations. The sound quality on it is perfect for a small room considering the price range it is in.  If you are looking for a booming sound this is not for you but it will provide a solid quality sound.	1
459359	I've been using these earbuds for several months now, and they're far better than the ones that come with the iPod. They're more comfortable, and there's so much more bass, although as everyone else pointed out you have to push them way into your ears to get the bass.	1
476793	Not quite as powerful as I was hoping for, but the sound is alright and in a small room it'll do fine.	1
501687	I am very pleased with this item. It is fits comfortably, holds my CD player snugly and has room for my ID, keys, extra batteries & CD's	1
512537	Cool! I can expand my-single-USB-port-laptop more flexible.	1
521300	The mouse is perfect for games. I use it to play ET and is great. The software provided by Logitech is configurable in all ways	1
545137	Just a note to those who've been having trouble opening these cases, without breaking them. If you use an emory board to slightly sand the top knob which is holding the case together, you'll be able to open and close it ok. Don't sand too much, and just do the top knob, or it won't hold together. I like the fact that these cases are clear and fairly inexpensive, so I wanted to make them work. Hope it works for you	1
557405	Just my two cents, I bought these from the sony store for $15 bucks two years ago, they've lasted me this long for light office use, so at $7/year, this seems to be a good budget earphones.  I'm not an audiophile, so I don't need expensive earphones.  However they did eventually die on me where the cable connects to the jack, the wires got loose and the sound just stopped.  Moral of the story: don't twist or touch the wires/cable.	1
570656	Sandisk, leader in this kind of technology products sure do not come short with this one. It works excellent on my phone Samsung t609.I would have bought a 1GB but the phone manufacturer do not recomend it, so bear that in mind. For pictures the resolution at close range and bright light is just excellent. For music as an MP3, lots of memory and room to fill as well as for video. Data and in general is terrific...just like I said Sandisk leads the competition and also seems to be the the standard card for just about any product that requires this kind of card. I will most definitely and undoubtely will not accept substitutions. Only Sandisk is extremely reliable. Personal experiences with these products proof it repeatledly.	1
591726	I was burned by another company with I bought their product and they didn't offer a replacement plan.  The item died and no one can repair it	1

B000FPLTRI:no_problems_here:marisa_nitsch_"theauctionstall"	Maybe beginning ones were a bad batch? Had mine months now and it works great. Everything it says, it does. No problems  keeping it in the system and did not cause any errors.	1
B00004TDN0:in_its_day...it_was_on_top.:s._horrocks	I have had my Handspring Visor Deluxe for 5...yes, FIVE years (actually longer).  While I take decent care of it, it has taken care of me.  My doctor has one too...exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced, but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to.  I finally ordered a new PDA with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it. (I'm not selling it...good karma)	1
B000G2BGFK:wd_mybook-the_answer_to_all_of_your_digital_storage_needs:kirk_j._blankenship_"www.academycurve.com"	I've been very pleased with this external drive-500GB. My only comments would be that at first the drive was a little 'hit or miss' with mounting on the desktop but a restart would always fix it. Now it seems to always mount. Its all automatic so no need to ever touch the drive. The other thing would be that it could use one more FireWire 400 port (there is only one). I don't use 800 yet so I need to daisy it off of my SmartDisk FireLite that happens to have 2. All in All-Get this drive	1
B000A2AGZC:quality_construction,_easy_installation:demanding_buyer	This is a high quality, precision made piece. I'm very particular about the construction of things that I buy and this Peerless arm more than met my expectations. It was easy to attach to the back of my 32" LCD television and equally easy to mount to the wall. I read a review of another arm where the buyer complained that there were many pieces to assemble. Not so here. Everything is assembled except for the mounting plates that attach to the back of the screen. All hardware is included along with clear, complete instructions. I'd be surprised if you could find something better	1

B0002A9RFM:gige_switch_that_is_both_fast_and_quiet:franticinfresno_"fresno14"	Like so many other small home office users, I have recently upgraded my network to 1000mpbs to help increase productivity.  Unfortunately, I originally purchased a GigE 8 port switch from another mfg. that used a fan on their switch, a VERY noisy fan.  After a month of listening to what sounded like an airplane engine, I tossed that unit and purchased this 8port Netgear GigE unit.  It is SILENT.  Basically a plug and play item due to its unmanaged nature, I have had good data thru put and no problem.  It comes with a small clip on stand for vertical storage if desired.  The unit is finished in an attractive gray and chrome exterior.  It is also small enough to live on a desktop with sucking up valuable real estate.	1
B00006YZ3Y:easy:bruce_c._erb	Within about 12 seconds of opening the box I was listening to my IPOD on my home stereo.  Wires are well made.	1
B0009H50OA:excellent_flashlight:obibo_"obibo"	Not quite as bright a conventional flashlight, but certainly bright enough. No battery feature can't be beat. Manufacturer claims it will stay on for a hour with a one minute wind. I've never left mine on that long, but I've only needed to wind it once in over a year. This is an excellent flashlight. I've bought several	1
B000EIW3E4:great_tv,_service_&_delivery:k._feltner	I have had my Samsung for about three weeks now; no problems.  I am extremely hapy with the picture quality and the number of inputs.  We also bought the 42" plasma for my parents; we've been extremely happy with it as well.  In addition to the television, I am extrmemly happy with Amazon and the delivery process.  Everythin was handled very professionally.  The tv arrived within the timeframe and undamaged.  I will buy next tv through Amazon as well	1
B0009ZAA4M:nifty_table_radio_sounds_great_-_works_great:mark_s._deneen_"juicymusic"	This is a surprisingly good radio at this price. It is small, compact and yet very robust and quite heavy. It is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store. Here are three things I really liked about this product: 1) The AM/FM reception is outstanding. I am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear. Listening to FM on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure. 2) The buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function. This is something Sangean seems to get very well. 3) The multi-level display lighting can be turned OFF, or up in 3 steps from dull to very bright.	1

B000ETYO7C:nice_brand-name_receiver_with_6.1:donald_j._larson_iii	This receiver puts out a lot of power. It also has a bit of weight to it. It comes with a microphone to automatically adjust it for optimal surround sound. The remote take some getting used to but it is great how you can hook up a DVD player, CD player, radio and many other devices. The display is nice. You really have to read the manual before you start plugging away. If you're a surround sound fan on a budget pick this up	1
B00004U8RE:good_quality_ink_for_an_inkjet_printer:"dargo2001"	The BCI-3eBk is good quality black ink for an inkjet printer.  I have used this ink for a couple of years now and don't recall it smudging on the pages I print.  The price on this product (compared to HP products) is fair, but I am able to print a 100 to 200 pages before running out of ink.  Of course, you will get more pages out of this cartridge if you print more color graphics than text	1
B00009AKLJ:just_what_the_doctor_ordered:r._dewitt_"cowboy"	Outstanding item. Plenty of room to carry dvds. Enough padding to protect the player, but not too bulky	1
B000EDI406:this_is_my_fourth_sony_dvd_player,_and_easily_the_best:sabalom_glitz	The very first DVD player I bought was Sony's very first 5 Disc DVD changer back in 1998. It was an excellent player, but as the technology improved, it could no longer keep up. I upgraded to a single disc Sony which could handle DTS, and later to another single disc player which could handle progressive video. But I always missed the convenience of a 5 disc changer after having been spoiled by one at the start. At about one-third the price of that original DVD changer, this player has all the features of those previous upgrades and more while retaining the familiar functionality of my first player. It produces an excellent picture, has lots of tweakable settings, has more outputs, and is also very stylish looking.	1
B000J2Q9HW:a_quality_product!!:tonio	After reading several reviews on portable speakers, I decided to purchase the Sonic Impact i-F2 for my iPod.  It has great sound quality, the case is durable, it packs away easily and you can take it anywhere.  You can listen to music while its charging and the sounds system is quite attractive.  This is by far the best accessory I've purchased for my iPod.  Did I mention that it has a remote control!!	1
B000BS4PZW:awesome_cycling_tool:steven_p._myers_"shocked_reader"	The Edge 305 provides a wealth of knowledge, is easy to install, as well as use. I would love to have given it 5 stars (it deserves them), but one thing that does not work correctly, and really bugs me is the calories expended. It couldn't be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way. The first day that I installed it, I took it for a quick 1 mile test ride. IT indicated that in that mile I burned 100+ calories. Wish it were true, but it is not. Unfortunetly the next day I was going to take it out on a 100 mile ride, but crashed as I started out and have not riden since (3 days). I wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further. After 2 hours it read 0 were burned. I just took it for a car ride of 7 miles. In those 7 miles DRIVEN IN A CAR, it indicates I burned nearly 600 calories, again I wish, but no way.	1
B000F9LRYO:digital_recorder_for_your_ipod:d._lange_"musician,_music_educator"	The Belkin TuneTalk is fabuous for using an iPod as a digital recorder. I have had very good results recording various music rehearsals (children's choir to big band) with and without an external powered microphone (Sony ECM-MS908C stereo mic) attached. Since I already had the mic, the total cost was very low compared to purchasing something like a Zoom digital recorder for this type of recording. I haven't plugged it into a mixing board yet. I suspect it would produce an even better recording with a decent pair of mics through a Mackie 1202 or better.	1

B000J421ZY:very_good_deal_for_a_reliable_product:roberto_renteria_navarro	I bought this card to be used with an IPAQ HW6945 it has enough capacity for GPS maps, programs and some music a 4 gb one would be great but it seems there is no 4gb card from Sandisk that is supported by the IPAQ. The reading / writing speed is ok too. Very good product for only 18 bucks	1
B00006BB7Y:the_most_comfortable_mouse_pad_in_the_world!:shazam_i_am	I have to say this mouse pad has far exceeded anything I hoped for. When I first opened the box it was shipped in I was very put off. There was a Very, Very strong chemical smell. I chalked it up to something in the packaging material. It turns out that was not where the smell was coming from. It was the mouse pad itself. Having worked in a shoe factory years ago I was able to identify the smell as an industrial glue. The smell hung around for a couple of days. Now, 1 week after having received my purchase if I put my nose close to the pad, it still carries the faint smell of industrial glue. I would caution those with allergies and/or asthma to consider this prior to purchase. As an asthmatic I can say it did affect my breathing some what. That seems to have gotten better as the smelled has lessened. I have finished with my public health warning. On to the mouse pad.	1

B000GOUE7Y:awesome_product.:k._tucker_"jalopy"	I really enjoyed this product and the fact that its simple to use!! It clips nicely onto my laptop or I can take it off, it comes with a little protective case, and the lens slides in to keep it unexposed when you're not using.  I really like it and all its features as well	1

B0009A1F6Y:16_gauge:a._chung	If you zoom in on the picture, you'll notice that it's actually 16 gauge wire.  I received it and can confirm that it's 16 gauge.  Wire works fine, although the spool that's held together by two bolts and nuts had one of the nuts missing.  It's not a big deal though, and my only disappointment was on my end when I realized 100' wasn't enough to hook up my 7 speakers	1
B00011KHVA:a_good_choice:j._mckenna	I received them OK none broken or cracked. This price beats Walmarts price and these cases are as good as any slim cases I have ever used. I like the translucent back better than the black ones at Staples	1
B000B88UF8:seriously_worth_the_money!!:jamie_c._anthonisen	I was a little worried about spending almost 70$ on this bag, but when I recieved it I was so impressed.  I really love this bag! Very well made!! The crocadile pattern is a lot more prominent than the picture shows, but I really like it. To be honest I shy away from croc patterns, but it really works with this bag! I have a 15.4 in. Gateway laptop and it fit perfectly in this bag	1
B000F9YN2M:a_traveller's_review:randall_g._neighbour	I travel overseas a lot for my job. This little power strip is compact and enables you to keep ONE adapter on the end of it to plug into the funky wall plug and then use your "normal" plugs for operating four devices. Most Monster products are terribly overpriced and not worth the money (wires, cables, etc.) but this gizmo rocks	1
B00024VTKO:great_notebook_case:carol_l._reed_"wise_shopper"	The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because I have only taken it on the road once, so as of yet I can't call it a worthy 'road warrior.' However, it is certainly a great case. Proportioned well and good design, with space for essentials. Would recommend for anyone looking for a good case for their 17" widescreen notebook	1

B000067V63:works_great_including_with_wireless_keyboard/mouse:"gewood"	Works just as expected.  Switches quickly among two desktop machines and a laptop (all running WinXP).  Each machine takes &lt; 1 min to recognize, same as when plugging in any new USB device.  Very durable cables.  Was concerned about using wireless keyboard/mouse, but works great with the Microsoft Wireless Desktop, including the multimedia function keys.  Version of the switch that I received is black, not white as pictured	1
B0006G0IHI:eton_hits_a_triple_!!!!:colin_t._stump	I've had my E-10 for around nine months and have been most impressed by it's performance. My interests in radio pretty much revolve around A.M.(or medium wave) DX'ing and shortwave listening. It's performance on A.M. is on a par with the highly regarded Kaito KA-1103 which I received for Christmas this year. Shortwave performance is very close, however, the Kaito is superior in this area (and features SSB tuning as well)F.M.? The E-10 is well above average but falls short of the Kaito KA-1103. I've yet to see a radio that can equal the Kaitos performance in this area, but the E-10 is closer than most.Build quality,ergonomics,and appearance are second to NONE and better than MOST. The slightly rubberized texture of this set just plain feels good when handling and adds to the to the overall impression that this is a "Top of the line" portable multi band receiver even though it's moderately priced.It's LCD digital display is one of the largest and nicest I've seen,very easy to see and well lit with a pleasant orange backlight. Other amenities such as 500 plus memories,12/24 hour clock,I.F. shift and antennae trim which are both useful in Shortwave reception,local/dx switch and the internal battery charger for NICAD or NIMH batteries all add up to make this a radio I'm glad I purchased and often recommend to those needing a radio of this type.Even the accessories included with this radio such as the carrying satchel,earbuds,and reel-up shortwave antennae are top notch! Now, if you're wondering why, after all this praise I only gave it a four star rating,and not a five it's because Eton did not provide SSB tuning capability on this receiver. And it's a shame because it's shortwave performance is good enough to utilize it. In my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio. Hence they only "hit a triple"(which is way more exciting nonetheless, I'm a baseball nut too) and not a home run	1
B0000AKUTS:cyberhome_abc-01_deluxe_portable_dvd:momof2	I love this item.  We bought 2 cases for our sons before we left for vacation.  It can hang from the seats but they just held them on their lap or layed it on the couch in the van.  The boys arranged everything in the case so the battery even fits in it.  I was glad about that.  I'd recommend this item.	1

B00008WMBS:can't_understand_the_problems_others_are_having:julie_a._thornberry_"julieforjesus"	This is my second one of this model, I burned up the first myself when we moved and I accidentially plugged the wrong transformer into it (too much voltage = smoke).  I found it easy to configure, set up WEP keys, MAC locked everything using the web-based interface.  It worked great with our LinkSys Media extender - we watch recorded tv from our Media Center pc on our plasma screen tv three rooms away using this device.  No problems whatsoever.  Hasn't slowed down my internet connection either.  I am buying another one today to serve the mobile computer lab at work.	1
B000ELSXYA:_beauty_in_a_sleazy_dress--the_good,_the_bad_and_the_ugly:b._martin_"altar_ego"	The GOOD: We plugged in our new LNS2651D on 3/7/7, about an hour northwest of Tampa Bay.  Right out of the box,with an old Rabbit Ear antenna, we received five HD broadcasts.  The picture is amazing in both color and clarity.  The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The "Piano Black" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.  I'm hoping after the R&D department who designed the case, is sent to Siberia, they redeem themselves by designing a Matte Finish slip- cover for this otherwise excellent TV	1
B0007PRAUQ:very_effective_and_a_bargain:marco_zunino	I made the mistake to buy the Kensington laser pointer before this one. The Kensington is a good one, very well made, but it is slightly more expensive and lacks the mouse control. I to not know any cheaper model with mouse function. I can maybe prefer a bit the ergonomy of the Kensington, together with the very practical possibility to store the USB receiver inside the unit, but this is probably just my taste and the hiro is quite comfortable either and lighter. My kensington has the embarrassing feature that the laser pointer is interpreted as RETURN on some applications (Exporer on Windows and Opera on Mac OS, for instance). I do not know it that is a bug or if there is some reason for that. However the Hiro does not have this behaviour and that is another reason for which I prefer it.	1

B0001A99ME:good_experience:kirk_hermsen	Item works perfectly fine.  A little slow on the shipping, so I suggest getting the faster shipping with the purchase of your item.  My experience could not have been better.  Excellent job thank you very much.  Great experience.	1
B000780866:wifi_seeker_exceeded_my_expectations:bart_beasley	When I first got a wireless network at home I purchased a Kensington WIFI Finder.  It worked fine.  But as time went on I saw these smaller versions come out from Chrysalis Development.  I heard they were more powerful and more versatile.  So I bought one.  I was NOT disappointed.  Since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car, it fit perfectly on my keychain.  Also it has a much longer range than the others.  But best of all, it is directional.  Meaning I can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the LEDs change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases.  What a great product. I Love it!	1

B000HNJ6U0:can't_live_without_it!:lee_givens,_jr._"mac_dude"	The EyeTV 2.x software is a bit rough around the edges (compared to Dish DVR and Tivo), but it's very usable and works great.  I bought this so I can watch the Maryland Terrapins at work (CBS MMOD blacks out local games) and it's great to be able to infinitely adjust the video window.  You can record the program and watch it at lunch or when you get a chance.	1
B000227PLS:everything_i_could_ask_for:j._prowe	I did a bit of internet research for this, and a site devoted to luggage was RAVING about this. What can I say? They were right, and it is just an unbelievable value. I love it.	1
B00062UW5A:great_with_print_works_cd/dvd_envelopes:corey_d._huebert_"computer_dude"	I use Print Works CD/DVD envelopes and was worried when I ordered this product that the envelopes wouldn't fit top-up which is important for me because I label the tops of my envelops to make looking through them easier. The envelopes are just a hair over 5" wide and they fit into these storage boxes perfectly. There is just enough room on either side to make flipping through the dvds easy. I ordered four of these and am glad I did. I keep them on a shelf side-by-seide and the make a perfect card-catalog-type filing systemfor all my dvds. I will most definately be ordering up more of these when I need more room; these boxes are great. If you use a 5" wide envelope, rest assured that these boxes are just the right size to fit all your dvds.	1
B00006FRUJ:ergonomic,_excellent_mouse_-_software_buggy:m._philips_"master_bluestar"	The mouse itself is very nicely designed and cool looking. I use it with my Apple Mac G5. The optical tracking is great, no moving parts. The scroll wheel is indispensable for browsing the web and scrolling through documents. I just wish the software that comes with it would be more stable, less buggy. I had to uninstall it and use another mouse driver with more options, functions and less bugs	1
B0001DHHHK:compatible_with_the_epson_r800_and_r1800_photo_printers:l._t._beasimer_"lb"	When it comes to ink for my R1800 photo printer, I am concerned with the quality of the images I print. The Epson matte black UltraChrome Hi-Gloss ink cartridge provides superior resistance to water, fading and smudging. It is important to me that my prints are of high quality, so I don't attempt to use the cheaper compatible ink cartridges. The color can be duplicated, but all inks are not created equal.  Third party options may produce a good print initially, but may not hold up or last as long.	1
B000234K8I:s-video_splitter:gary_torstenson	I needed to have an s-video feed from my classroom computer to a projector and to a TV/Monitor.   This proved to be the most cost-effective solution to the problem.  It works just as hoped	1
B000FGLYWM:excelent_delivery_and_value:ganj_ahmad	I received my package within three days via the Super Saver Shipping (cost me nothing). The printer is great, too. I used the Brother 1440 series before and now upgraded to HP and I'm impressed. The printer shoots out the first page immediately without having to warm up, and its very light weight and small size making it more portable. I love it	1
B000CQ73PW:good_price-value_relationship:rosebud	This card was easy to install and works well. I have very little experience even opening a compter box. Making a spot for the connection to come out of the computer case turned out to be the most difficult part.	1
B00006B7RJ:canon_ink_jet_photo_paper:fenwick_r._small	This is extremely high quality photo paper best used in Canon photo printers.  The 13" by 19" is used best with the Canon I9000 printer series, with a web of 13".  This paper resists moisture damage and has archival quality.	1
B00006EHKS:good_little_corded_phone:henry_chinaski	Since there is now relatively few choices for a good corded phone (esp. with caller ID), this phone is tops. This phone and all other AT&T phones corded or cordless, exhibit slight feedback when talking loud or when hanging up.  But no other phone out there seems to be nearly as durable.  Given the other choices, this is the one to get	1
B00019K87A:love_it:ronald_anderson	Makes plane flights so much more enjoyable and costs hundreds less than other brands.  Only  thing that could make it better is passive noise reduction but then it would be bulkier	1
B000EH8K9W:best_dvd_media_out_there.:james_l._duffy_"duffman"	These DVDs never fail...	1
B00065HMAU:perfect_for_my_needs:digital_dave	In spite of some of the poor reviews for this product, it met all of my expectations 100%. Thanks to the reviews, I understood that the unit doesn't have a builtin antenna or batteries, which was helpful to know in advance. But of course the specifications never claimed those features in the first place.	1
B000K5Y25E:great_product_:amazon_girl_"adele"	My daughter is very happy with the product. She not only got the MP3 player she wanted, she also got her favorite color "PINK". Thought we got a great deal and it has been working wonderfully. Infact, my son is now jealous that his younger sister has a better MP3 player than he has	1
B0002S079E:grandchild_loved_it!:patricia_vines_"trish"	I purchased the Casio keyboard for my Grand-daughter's 4th birthday.  She really enjoyed playing it.  As a matter of fact she was still interested in it the next day.  It is the perfect size for a small child.  She sits in her recliner and has the keyboard across the arms.  The only thing that wasn't perfect is that you can mute what the child is playing, but not the 10 songs that are prerecorded in it	1
B00006I58N:fellowes_powershred_lubricant_cutter_oil:walker_c._e._beddoes	What I ordered - on time delivery - good price	1
B00008CLZS:great_boom_box:kolleen_powers_"kolleenp"	This is an excellent boom box if you want to be able to take your SkyFi out of your car and put it in the house or take it anywhere. It works great	1
B000KDFDZE:exelente!!!!!!!:marcelino_mosquea	i already test a loot of mobo... asus, msi (my last was k8n diamond), and others... but this board looks like no other, and realy works!!! for gamers is the ultimate board... i really recomend it!	1
B0000524PF:worth_the_money_for_hdtv_performance!:c._brewer	As the PS2 does not have HDMI outputs for High-Definition TV's, the Monster Cable GameLink 400 component cable is the next best thing and worth a few bucks more. You'd have to be retarded to not notice the difference between these component cables and standard (red, white, yellow) AV cables picture clarity. They are in two different worlds and Monster fully delivers. However, your TV must have component (red, blue, green) inputs for this cable to be useful.	1
B0009VE21S:work_well_for_their_purpose_(and_their_price):c._m._grisez_"go_bucks"	These buds are definitely a step up from the standard iPod buds.  They stay in your ears much more easily (without the foam black covers, which are easily lost), the sound is at least marginally better, and the overall construction seems to be better.  You can't do much better for the money.	1
B000ASIAHM:perfect:tom	This is the first DVD recorder I purchased. I used the quick set up guide and I was off to the races. The quality of my recordings are crisp and clear. The nero software is user friendly and makes recording dvds easy. I'm totally satisfied with my purchase plus I'm recieving a [...]rebate to top it off	1
B0001OHH60:pricey_-_but_worth_it:electronics_guy	This cable really cleaned up the display image. I had been running another Monster Cable - the 6 meter version. I needed the length before because of the way my system was configured. I have a review under that cable about how quality does matter.	1
B0009Q4UBK:ipod?___sucks_next_to_this.:sokudo_ningyou_"devious_lark"	Besides the fact that iPod is a skinny little waste of time, let's also mock the fact that it plays about two formats: whatever Mac plays, and MP3.  Woohoo.   What a selection.	1
B00006B83F:great_product,_lite_weight:s._a._kane	I love this product.  Unfortunately, I blew mine up in West Africa (my computer was not damaged), so when I returned I ordered another right away.  I wish that it were a little thinner, but I suppose you can't have everything....at least right now	1
B000F3XIMY:the_best_hard_drive__for_the_buck.:s._kartasasmita_"visual_junkie."	I have used These Seagate Drives for almost 2 years now. They work nicely for editing movies, and I like the combo Firewire and USB2.0 interface. I trust these cheaper Seagate than the expensive LACIE (we bought a box full of lacie D2, they ALL fail in 6 months) or store brand drives. Hard drives are prone to failure. But Seagate has served my company well.	1
B00007JQLV:fairly_good_yoke!__i_like_it!:c._logan_"loganonmission"	I got this yoke to use with Microsoft Flight Simulator.  Other people have said that the build quality is poor on this yoke, but what did you expect?  It's just a computer game controller, it's not meant to feel like an actual pilot's yoke.  If it were, it would probably be much, much more expensive!	1
B000BF0XEW:direct_comparison_between_linksys_and_trendnet:robert_salita_"software_developer"	This is a direct comparision between the Linksys WUSBF54G and TrendNet 509UB.	1
B000KURO9K:viamichelin_x-930_gps:turbo	If you're considering the ViaMichelin (under $200 GPS), you're probably trying to decide if a GPS that is more than $100 cheaper (much more than $100 in some cases) than its competitors is really any good. Honestly, I would have been skeptical too, however, a relative bought one of these units, and that gave me a chance to get their feedback before I decided to purchase one myself.	1
B0009KF2P4:you_get_what_you_pay_for.:jessica_kurtz	I originally bought this CD case for my car, because I listen to CDs the most while driving.  This was not a good case to bring back and forth at all.  It is very large and heavy (even without CDs!), and the long zipper-tail makes it hard to open with one hand.  I now use it to house computer software and playstation/gamecube games.  For what you pay, it is an excellent buy	1
B0007KI7AI:awesome_solution_to_ipod's_power_needs:firefly_digital_media_"proud_american"	I got the Griffin iTrip to enjoy my iPod in my car, and then I HAD to get a Belkin TuneBase for iPod mini! With the short battery life that is further aggravated when using the iTrip, the TuneBase keeps my iPod charged so that I don't have to plug it into my computer's USB port every night after work	1
B000KEGCC6:excelente_monitor:jose_anzola	Ya tengo una semana con el y lo recomiendo ampliamente La imagen y la nitidez de este monitor son sobresalientes Con una resolucion de 1680 x 1050 las fotos tomadas con mi camara digital se ven como una imagen real Tiene varios ajustes segun el uso que le quieras dar Viene en espaol	1
B000HBEKJE:just_what_it_says:gentle2	I love the Sling Media Slingbox Tuner!  The install was very easy just as they had said on the reviews.  The quality of picture is just as good as on my Cable TV.  I have a great processor with the highest internet speed I could get though my cable so that may contribute to the good quality picture and color I get with it and may also be the reason I have had no problems with doing computer work and watching the screen at the same time. Plue my shipment from Amazon was in 2 days!  You rock Amazon!	1
B00061U3Q4:transcend:keith_l._moore	So far this seems to be an extremely effective (and inexpensive) way to store pictures captured with a multi-mega pixel digital camera. The sevice provided by this company shipping-wise was very fast. All-in-all a great deal	1
B00006345I:skeptic_turned_fan:a._rahaw_"the_professor"	After reading several reviews of this product I was skeptical about buying this cable.  I wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my PS2 but I was not sure about paying the price for these when the Sony cables are about half the cost of the Monster Cables.  The reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the PS2 properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the TV almost discouraged me from even buying this product.  I decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my PS2.  I am very happy that I decided to buy these cables.  The cable connector fits perfectly into my PS2, better than the connector on my original Sony cables even.  The connectors fit nicely onto my TV, they are snug but not too tight.  I believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my TV because of the 8-cut turbine connector, which fits better than a standard RCA plug.  The video and audio from my PS2 is unbelievable.  My PS2 pushes the video signal to my 32" LCD HD TV at 480i with these cables.  With my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear and I only wish I would have bought these sooner.  The display from my PS2 and games fits nicely onto my TV in widescreen now too, before the picture was not centered on my TV and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen.  I would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their PS2 over the stock Sony cables.  There are other Monster Cable versions for the PS2 available so choose the one that is right for you, but if you want something that is moderately priced, don't need digital audio via fiber, and the next best thing to HDMI than this is the cable for you.  I am going to get the Monster component cables for my PS3 next so I will be able to hook it up when I don't have HDMI available for it to use.	1
B0000TNZDK:idiot_proof_remote:smiling	First time I've ever written a review.  I'm not a high tech type, and sometimes it's nothing but frustration for me to deal with high tech stuff.  This remote was a breeze to program, and works fantastic.  My wife and daughter are even less high tech and love it.  Any problems with use, just press "help" and the remote with ask you questions and correct the problem.  Highly recommended	1
B000E59I2M:fine_for_charging:kam	Needed the adapter to charge my Shuffle, since the AC adapter I have is one of those older Apple ones with the Firewire connector. Suits my needs perfectly.	1
B000KLZ7VG:greatly_pleased:ben_bresky_"ben_bresky"	Just purchased earbuds at target.  Excellent sound quality, expected that much due to a previous of full headphones.  Even better once you find the right adjustable tip to fit your ear.  Well worth my 100 dollars, granted, I've only had them 5 to 10 minutes, but I won't be returning them any time soon	1
B000DINCIQ:performs_as_advertised:wireless_fan	Length of ownership: 8 weeks	1
B000BGTVDK:florida_to_s._carolina:f._petrilli_"fede"	I just made a long trip from Miami, Florida, all the way to S. Carolina, with a Explorist XL loaded with DirectRoute V3, everything worked just fine, I installed the software, unlock It, upload the maps, all with out any problems, the unit was very fast and accuracy didn't need to keep it over the dashboard, from inside the vehicle worked very well, never took more than a minute to track all satellites, the street route where very accurate, never  got lost, working with POI's was very simple, didn't have any problem handling very large maps I really recommend this unit	1
B000EU0UVA:sony_receiver:dessi_i._bravo	I also purchased this product because of the quality of the receiver made by Sony. This 7.1 channel Home Theater with HDMI passthrough is a great machine that money can buy. If you are looking for quality, surround sound in your livingroom, or your own Home Theater, this s the product you should invest in. This is a great investment for me. I am glad I found it in Amazon	1
B000EVM5DK:excellent!!:sandeep_narpala	the cam is good...it has a special feature to show the person/object by automatic adjustment...and a very good part abt it is, it has a built in mike and helps a lot..	1
B000B5S6WI:big_sound_out_of_a_small_package.:robert_dee	the Klipsch igroove can go toe to toe with the more expensive bose sound wave all day long. I researched dockable ipod / mp3 players for a few months before I decided on this one for my wife's office.	1
B0002WYJN0:zippy_scan:c._segovia	We love the card scanner, it's the best. Everyone who is a recruiter should have one it saves time and space	1
B0009ORXF2:great~!!!:in_soon_jang_"yujincatherine_jang"	I can't describe this MP3 with words "great"	1
B0002Z4536:good_so_far:ratyoke	I have had this item for about 6 weeks.  Haven't used to a lot, but so far I like it.  This power inverter is smaller and looks nicer than my old one, which was stolen out of my car along with a few other things.	1
B000JQV8LA:was_what_i_needed:nori_silverrage_"nori"	I bought this for my new Sony Ericson W300i phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone. It came with a MS pro adapter which is nice because I have a slot on my computer for that. It is fast and just what I wanted	1
B000H0UUV2:nice_bonus:robert_h._ells	It was great that the Nikon D8 purchase included a SanDisk MicroMate with USB connection	1
B000E9BYXE:best_hd_buy!:t._cosentino	I purchase this on Amazon for $499 no tax & free shipping. You can not match this quality at this price. The HD with HDMI cable using Comcast digital box is outstanding. The sound is also better with the HDMI vs componet cables. The jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode. The picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color. I looked at Samsung for $800 and I am glad I saved myself $300 with this LCD	1
B0000C109P:good_purchase:jose_seas	The item works as I expected. I received within the tiem offered by the seller. I'll buy again from this merchant	1
B000E6Z4E2:meets_my_home_office_needs:m.s._"tech_guy"	I purchased the LJ3390 to replace an existing LJ3320.  The $350 rebate available until the end of Oct was the deciding factor as it made the unit a very reasonable purchase.	1
B000FPGP4U:presenter:robert_j._goodenberger	This product is simple to use and has all of the functionality I need while presenting	1
B000JEWIV6:altec_lansing_im510_speaker_system:thomas_a._nadolski_"tom_n"	I bought this for my daughters Sansa e230 mp3 player and could not be more satisfied. I was leary of the price, but this unit is worth every penny. Recharges your player and has awesome sound for the size, while plugged in or with batteries. No regrets about this purchase	1
B000HAR8UI:acer_22"_black_is_a_winner.:ronald_l._boring_"ronnie_bee"	Installation time was only about 20 min. Hook up the Digital and analog cables, and it configures itself. It took me a while to decide which resolution to use that was best for me, but once I found it, I was really pleased with the size and clarity. Music composition is much easier with the big screen. One small con was the stand is not adjustable, but it fit perfectly into my office space, so I didn't need the adjustment. The video quality on this LCD is amazing.	1
B000AQQDU0:garmin_streetpilot_c_series_a/c_charger:rita_t._gallagher	this is good for when you go on a trip you know it will keep your streetpilot going. and it isn't bulky. and it's made with quality just like the streetpilot itself	1
B00004U8RH:what_can_you_say?__:m._hurley	Use Canon ink with you Canon printer and you'll have no problems, just excellent pictures	1
B00004U8RG:exactly_what_i_wanted_quickly:s._moffat	I ordered this product and it arrived 2 days later. It is genuine Canon ink for a great price. I will definitely buy at amazon.com again	1
B000BFFXOW:armband_+_skin_=_good_value:inalaska	This armband provides good protection to the nano via a skin that the nano slides into and a rigid clear protector that fits over the screen (stays in place by pressure from the skin pressing down on rubberized edges of the protector).	1
B00004U8A1:easy_to_assemble,_classic_look:bradly_baxter	Very easy to assemble, has very classic lines, lets stereo equipment have plenty of ventilation, hard to find add-on shelf in maple. Holds a lot of equipment	1
B0001MKTZS:nothing_compares:soulfunky	The thing that seperates this DVD Case from the rest is it's center lock design. It's secures the disc nicely without damaging it... like I have had others do. Worth the extra dough to have a quality product. (Now if only their memorex's software was as good!	1
B000098YCP:great_buy_for_any_reason!:andrew_j._gray_"z3r0"	I used to buy those cheap $[...] red laser pointers at gun shows and flea markets, just to have some fun, but the batteries didn't last long enough and the beam wasn't bright at all, not to mention that it made more of an oval dot than round.  I bought this one thinking that it would be really cool because it was green.  I thought the high price tag was pushing it just for a little green dot, but it is much more than I thought it would be.  The beam is clearly visible in the dark and you can even see the dot on the blackest street in the middle of a sunny day.  The range is incredible and makes street signs reflect hreen shimmers!  I love it!  A much better buy than those crappy red ones, and the AAA batteries are easy to replace and last much longer	1
B000HS2N1O:the_best_drive_i_have_ever_owned:melvin_dudley_"loversrule"	Also at an awesome price. I am going to buy another one just to keep in case the one I have needs to be replaced	1
B0007TJ9SI:good_marine_radio:d._bent_"bamafan_01"	This is a great radio for sailboats and other boats that do not have a 12v power supply	1
B000BN7CRU:nice_sound:randy_lantz	For the price, these speakers are well worth the cost. Of course, in my opinion, anything that dosnt say "Creative" on it is usually worth the price. Not a lot of bass, but with the bass boost, these speakers sound real nice. Only bad thing I'll say is that M-Audio's tech department is really bad. Emailed them about a week ago inquiring about driver updates for Vista, still no answer. (my inquiry was about a different m-audio product)	1
B0002M7FCC:powerful,_tight_bass:shane_n._cotee	I just added this to my Onkyo HTIB system and it's made all the difference in the world. I'm a bit of an audiophile (on a reasonable budget), with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one 10" Polk in my truck. I'm most satisfied with the Polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess. I listen to a lot of music with double-bass drumming and thought that this PSW12 would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the 10" sub I like so much. Not the case. What I get is very quick bass with that ground-shaking impact that I always look for.	1
B00003CWFJ:the_best!:michael_r._roden	You can count on every Monster Cable made. It's worth the extra money over the cheap ones. The gauge of the wire is thicker and the ends are made of better material	1
B0002XZQAE:works_great!:tom	This product has worked great with my 2Wire Gateway modem from AT&T Yahoo.	1
B00066ISVQ:not_the_advertised_fan:imaginate	While the two fans I ordered for a new computer build are functioning properly, they are not as advertised on Amazon's website.  According to the specs on the site, they have a double ball-bearing design which last longer than normal fans. Be warned, these are NOT the Antec double ball-bearing fans, but the less expensive ones.  Have contacted Amazon and hope they update the specs to reflect these accurately	1
B000069JWX:sony_cdpcx455_400_disc_megastorage_cd_changer_:the_captain	I had great hope for this product.  It has, mostly, so far, lived up to my expectations.  Here are some caveats...	1
B0006ON0QQ:saved_my_hd!:jbdan12	I recently purchased the Pacific Breeze Laptop Cooler and so far am very impressed with it.  Now this review should be taken with a grain of salt, because I have only had the cooler for a few weeks, but I feel that the results were evident immediately and the build does seem adequate.  The reason that I was in search of a cooler was due to my dangerously hot hard drive temps.  I installed Notebook Hardware Control (free temperature and power control utility) after feeling how hot my new notebook was getting and saw temps as high as 55C at my hard drive!  Worried about how this would affect the hard drive's longevity, I started looking around at coolers.	1
B00008616E:converter_cable:barbara_mchugh	We received this item very quickly.  It was exactly what we ordere	1
B0002VAQR4:memory_works_like_it_should:eileen_d._copeland	No problem whatsoever with this product.  It was delivered in a timely manner and worked perfectly	1
B0009X6QH4:best_radio_for_those_looking_for_a_user-friendly_shortwave:mjq	This radio has excellent features for someone who is either new to shortwave radio or just wanting a simple, user-friendly set of controls.  Also perfect for those that like analogue-style controls that would be encountered on older radios.  I have the S-350, the model that the S-350DL replaces.  For general world band programme listening, this radio is fantastic.  Outstanding speaker.  Easy to read digital display includes backlight.  Includes attenuator.  Clock can be set to 24 hour time.  Easy to carry anywhere.  Robust antenna.  Does not support SSB tuning, which you would need to tune in Ham radio.  Same radio sold under Tescun name in other parts of the world	1
B0000AOWW9:works_well,_but_difficulty_hooking_up_to_computer:l._dipietro_"hookedonamazon"	Mouse is comfortable to use, and I haven't had any problems with it so far.  I did have some difficulty hooking it up to my computer, but once I figured out the problem it was all smooth sailing from there.  It is my first wireless mouse, so I have nothing else to compare it to, but i definitely like it a lot better than my old mouse.	1
B000FA7PUI:if_you_can_have_only_one_radio:m._jeffrey_mcmahon_"herculodge"	Every house should have a Grundig S350 Deluxe. Big, brawny, "grabbing" in all the hard-to-get stations with ease, championing a big antenna that says this radio means serious business, the Grundig S350 Deluxe version, is a bigger, better version of the old Grundig S350, eliminating some of the "drift" problems of the earlier model. The speaker on the Deluxe is bigger and brighter. Whereas your fancy digital preset radios often sound like tin, the Grundig S350 DL has depth. Is it a perfect radio? No. You don't have presets in spite of the digital read-out. You get a little AM overload. Here in Los Angeles I get overload on 1150 so that I'm listening to two shows at once. Also the cheaper (and cheaper built) GE Superradio boasts an internal AM ferrite antenna twice the size and as a result gets slightly better AM.	1
B00009W42Y:very_good_headphones_for_the_money:a._stover_"depressed"	I live in an apartment building and play ( well, practice is a better word ) the bass guitar and needed headphones so I wouldn't bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs TV about 6 feet from where I sit and play.	1
B000KI7140:"what_a_great_piece_of_furniture!":m._sardilli	"My husband and I bought this for our new home and we're both thrilled!  He loves that it holds our new TV and stereo system, and I love the way it looks. It's extremely sturdy and he was able to put it together in less than a couple of hours. We're so glad we found something we could both agree on!  What a great piece of furniture!	1
B000H0QDCC:my_zune_is_much_better_than_my_two_malfunctioning_ipods:klh_"internet_junkie"	I have two iPods that don't work.  I bought a shuffle first and that has an error that I can't fix and Apple can't fix.  So, I thought I'd buy 1GB iPod a year later and that broke down even with a new computer.  So, this time I made the right decision and bought the 30 GB Zune.  Wow!  The Zune is so much better!  It has such a better feel to it and the controls react nicely, instead of making you frustrated like the iPod.  The screen is perfect.  Sound quality is excellent.  5 Stars for the Zune.	1
B0009K3IGE:smooth_as_silk:daniel_l._mcclure_"mccphoto"	This compact mini was exactly what we needed to use as a server for our photography studio. All computers can pull from it with no noticible slow down. It was the smoothest install and network to our 6 computers. I will buy another very soon to use as a backup to the first	1
B00008VF3X:old_standby:christopher_ferry	This is about the only mouse I buy, have gone through a couple of them in the past few years.  I just can't see spending alot of money on something thats going to naturally wear out.  This model is one that I find comfortable for the hand and durable in the using.  If you want a good, reliable, comfortable mouse, this logitech is a good choice	1
B00013BNKW:solid!:j._libertor	I already have two of these for my heavy rear bose speakers. The speakers are about are about 10 lbs each and are easily handled.	1
B0009FUAR4:ge_75325_spacemaker_am/fm_radio_/_cd_player:b._zerkle	Works great out of the box. Some reviews mentioned problems with the CD but mine worked fine but took some time to start on the first try.  It mounted easly under the upper kitchen cabinet.  No problem with signal strength happy to say since the unit it replaced had problems.  The brightness of the digital clock is adjustiable and I use it as a night light in the kitchen.  The remote control is powerful enough to control the unit from accross the room and adheres to the refrigerater (magnet) with my wife useing it to hang things.  This is a Thomson Inc product (purchased the GE & RCA names several years ago) that makes TV's ect.	1
B0001A9C5I:great_for_what_i_use_it_for:k._litchholt	Im not a professional keyboard player. I bought this keyboard to have something to play around in with reason and Guitar Pro.  It suits those needs great.  Its detects right away and withing minutes you will be playing.	1
B00004RDL5:pioneer_pd-f1009_301:k._e._smith	Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a "juke box". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound	1
B0007IG20C:needs_help_:william_t._tucker_"tom"	This is a great card for a laptop, however they need to correct their problems with the installer for XP. Also to get thru to them for any help is a major challenge, took me 4 days to get thru on their 800 line. Once you do get to them they fix the problem right away, seems they know it will not install correctly. Then it works great	1
B000F34IBE:high_quality_and_excellent_value:robert_p._molina_"molingo"	These DVDs are probably the highest quality and most reliable that I have tried.  And given their low price, what is there not to like?  I would recommend these to just about anyone	1
B000BN9F84:best_sound_for_the_money_-_best_comfort:c_powell	I've been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years.  I've used these for 8 months now and wear them almost everyday.  I ride a motorcycle everyday and I never leave without these.  First, the comfort is exceptional.  Even with my helmet on, I never get uncomfortable with these in my ears.  I've ridden 400 miles at a time without any problems.  Even when I need a break from the music, I leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise.  I've used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable - tolerable at best, but most are painful with a helmet on.  The "bulb" you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear, so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep.  Second, the sound quality is fantastic.  Great bass, mids, and highs.  I've heard things in my music I never knew was there and I can't wait to listen more.  I can't recommend these enough.  I've bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine	1
B0006TIA1G:great_network_storage_and_backup:aaron_d._mishkin	I've been using this NAS for a month and it's great!  The box is quite speedy with a Maxtor ATA 133 drive with a 16mb cache.  I have it wired and it never disconnects and will transfer large files without hanging.  Got it up and working in around 40 minutes and have it set to incrementally back up my files.  Very slick!  I can't get the built in FTP server to work through my firewall but I think that's a ports issue.  All in all a great box	1
B00070Q1MY:my_coworkers_love_these!:cathy	I am an IT Director and bought these for exercisers for my users. The outside is like a balloon, only much stronger rubber, and the inside is gel. When you squeeze them, the part that squeezes through your fingers changes color - it's cool! The resistance is very good and my users love them! Good product - great value and excellent quality	1
B0000CE3CF:works_perfectly-pc_and_mac!!:e_pleb_neesta!	This card works exactly as stated by StarTech. I bought two - one for a PC and one for a Mac, popped 'em in and plugged in iPods, external hardrives, a scanner, and digital cameras and the cards worked perfectly. The PC needed a quick setup and the Mac worked instantly!	1
B000GDEZLG:no_regrets_whatsoever:brian_l._jones	I did a lot of research, not wanting to rush into anything and then regret it after seeing something else a week later. I was about to buy the newest 40" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.	1
B000ENQUDE:happy_with_my_purchase:rosemary_stafford	It was easy ordering, easy delivery and satisfying outcome. Love the TV	1
B00028B57C:easy,_stable,_and_fast:b._weldon	Works as advertised, I needed longer range and it provided, easy setup, stable connection	1
B00005AR4L:i_love_it:ohio_john_"large1269"	My Panasonic RV31K is five years old this month and after thousands of hours playing movies it works just as well today as when I first took it out of the box. Panasonic makes quality products and just like anything else mechanical you can get a lemon. If this player ever dies (cross my fingers) I will get another Panasonic. I choose mine after reading all of the reviews here and in epinions.co	1
B0001MMH9E:nice_tape_player...:f._jannarone	If you like to listen to audio tapes you will like this one. Replacing the provided headphones is a good idea. FM reception a little weak, but the tape play time on ONE AA battery is amazing. Lightweight and good quality for the price	1
B0006VCHWW:great_guitar!:c._e._della_"camydella"	I ordered this for my teenage daughter for Christmas and she loves it.  The sound is great and the amplifier works well.  For the price it plays like a much more expensive instrument.  I recommend this to any new player wanting to learn the guitar	1
B000HSEEY8:compact_flouresecent_bulbs_will_not_fit:gary_richardson_"ebay_entrepreneur"	Compact flouresecent bulbs will not fit this fixture unless you order special CF's with extended bases. Other than that, it can't be beat for the price and quality. Adorama Rocks	1
B000KFWFHG:smooth_graphics:enrique_pulpillo	This card is one of the best, the  graphics are very high! i play games at full specs, needs a big chassis because generates heat, i did bought a TT Armor and my system works better, easy installation.	1
B00008VF78:does_what_it_was_designed_to_do:philip_j._degrandis	I purchased this so my PC could share a monitor with my XBOX360.  Does the job at a cheap cost!  So easy to use that my 4 yr. old can use it	1
B00009L1WU:good_dvd-rw:helen_a._kinzel	These are the only reliable disks I have found.  I began a collection of Friends on my dvd-rws.  I have over 25 disks full so far and only had minimal problems with 1 or 2 disks.  I rewatch all my favorite episodes, of which I have over 100 and have no problems.  These are the best	1

B000A68UPQ:this_polish_is_the_best!!:peter_farms	I hva tried alll kinds of stuff on the iPod, and this is th eonly one that got rid of all the scratches. Thanks for a  fantastic product	1
B000COKR2K:loving_my_xmb-10:l._reed	The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking.	1
B000GUQ2XI:great_multifunction_printer_for_price:a._thornton_"gatsby"	I've had HP and Lexmark printers in the past.  This Canon outshines both of the other brands.  It is super easy to install WITHOUT any troubleshooting.  Works like a charm.  The prints looks great	1
B000ES75WE:great_bedroom_hdtv:b._levin	I would give a high recommendation for this TV.  It is the perfect size for a bedroom especially if you're not looking to overwhelm the room but you just want something to watch a late night movie, the morning or evening news, or the late shows in high def.  DVD player works great and really completes the package as it seems not to increase the size of the TV at all.  The picture is outstanding and isn't that what really matters in the end??!!  The only little annoying thing concerns what would have been a great feature but has a big limitation - the TV has an auto-on feature so that you can use it like an alarm clock but it requires that you select a channel on which to tune the TV once it goes on.  It you are use the HDMI as I am to get signal from your cable box, you must have the TV input mode set to HDMI but you can't set the auto-on to the HDMI input (it must be a channel number).  The engineers just didn't think that one through all the way.  Oh well, still a great TV	1
B0002EPWT8:terk_sir-mini_roof_antenna:nuclear_"nuclear"	Works great.	1
B000IZAN4K:creative_sound_blaster_x-fi_xtremegamer_fatal1ty_pro_series_sound_card_:s._kondas	Great soundcard!  I noticed in Battlefield 2142 that I can hear the sounds of footsteps behind me better.  I'm not getting knifed as often (which is a very good thing!)  I'm glad I got this card	1
B000F9YN2C:great_little_power_strip:matt_lafleur_"matt"	This is a great little power strip that allows me to maximize the contents of my briefcase. One of the most useful things I have ever bought for business travelling. Very well made. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little less expensive	1
B00000DM9W:great_radio:merchanimal_"david_in_iowa"	This is by far the best radio I've ever had for singing in the shower.  No more fumbling and messing with the dial while I've got soap in my eyes... 10 fm presets, 5 am presets and 5 tv presets + weather, I'm always able to find something good to listen to.  It works great for when I'm out in the yard doing some work as well.	1
B0001IVB1S:excellent_product:calvin_t._watlington_"calvincito"	I love the sound quality and the way I am able to exercise and not notice that I have headphones on.  The headphones don't slide but I have had some difficulty adjusting them for a more snug fit.  Overall, well worth the money	1
B000GIPHNG:recommended:m._atilla_can_"atillacan"	It is very small and looks very cool.you can charge it very fast.ts sound is very good too.t has radio function too	1
B000EI5QWA:i_completely_love_the_hd72_(hd6800):modrnknght	I had an Optoma H27 but felt it was lacking the brightness I liked on TV, and I heard that HD72 was much better.  So I returned my H27 to Costco and got the HD6800, which is Costco's version of the HD72.  Wow, "much better" hardly describes it!  The brightness is incredible, and the detail and colors are truly remarkable.  The other night, I was trying out different DVDs just to see what they looked like on the new system, and I was totally blown away.	1
B0000CFYM9:slim_jewel_cases:kathy_l._phillips_"sci_fi_seeker"	They are great for putting DVD's, CD's in.  They arrive in great condition	1
B00006JPD5:terrific_performance_-_an_essential_product_for_video_interviews:robert_trudeau	The Azden transmitter-receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews. As an aspiring video maker it was a product I should have bought a long time ago.	1

B000ALWWMI:sirius_radio_home_docking_kit:kenneth_c._oday	Having a bad view of the southern sky, I needed to get a outdoor antenna for my sirius radio.It maded all the difference. Great product and it came with 30 ft. of cable	1
B000F768IQ:hp_f1905e_19"_lcd_monitor:jimmy_r._sanger	Ordered directly from HP. Fast delivery,solid package. No dead pixel. Works perfec	1
B000FHFKGW:brother_lable_maker:will_berninger_whitewater_aviation_inc.	The lable maker was removed from the box and put into action with ease.  Product is easy to use and understand.  For the money a great purchase.	1
B0002ZHG14:great_cd_cdrw_cleaner:peter_j._peters	Outstanding cleaner for your CD or CDRW, MP3 player.  Takes you through many diagnostic tests.  Even has a Dolby test.  Well worth the money and you will be more than pleased with it.  I used it on both my PC CD and CDRW drives as well as my stereo CD player.  Fantastic product!!	1
B000FL3HHC:the_best_deck_ever:shari_finley	I bought this deck about 6 months ago. It has performed flawless in every aspect. As soon as I turned it on I could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck. I have taken all of my cd's out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface. The ipod function is flawless and easy to use. Just plug in your ipod and search by artist, album, song title or playlist. This can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so I would suggest using playlists. The output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing. Also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs, this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment. This deck is the best overall I have ever listened to	1
B00005N5WX:a_good_radio...:sean_farrell	I recently bought and installed this radio in my truck, and I have not had any problems yet!!!  A few minor details are the noise blanker seems really sesitive (sometimes when it is on I do not receive any traffic) but that is about it.  I enjoy Cobra products, this is my second radio (I just traded up from a 25NWXT), I have a Cobra HG2000 Antenna, and I am waiting on a Cobra Mic for my radio.  So far no problems with any of it and I hope to have none down the road!!!!	1
B000J1F1BI:well...it_worked_with_my_motherboard.:false_prophet	FANTASTIC sound for the money!  (seems to work well with Asus P5W DH, anyway)  Nice crisp highs, decent mid-range and unmuddied lows make this an excellent pick, IMO.  The only down-side I could find is some of the nonsense-software included is, well, nonsense.	1
97889	I was very disappointed. It has a definite after taste. I was surprised at the small container size. After tasting I was glad it was small. Would I order it again? Yuck!	0
248629	This was the most disgusting diet product I've tried.  I love marshmallow dip, and this wasn't even close to tasting like it.  It has a chemical taste, like you're eating spun plastic, and makes you actually scared to eat it.  Why even bother eating it.  I'll stick with fat free whipped topping -- at least it has flavor	0
277052	These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell.  They cook strangely and taste odd	0
487233	The actual cheese is GREAT, if you can get them to ship to you.  Ordered items as gifts - took over a week to ship.  For timely gifts you would be better off going around the corner.  Otherwise a great deal	0
566448	I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own	0

B000328PLQ:i_just_cannot_say_enough_bad_things_about_tomatoes:jason_jackson_"jason_lee_jackson"	So really, how important is this fruit, err vegetable, err fruit?  I mean, I like salsa, and a hamburger just would not be the same without catsup, err ketchup.  Come to think of it, spaghetti would not be the same either.  But eating these things plain is just silly.  The taste is not so bad, but the consistency is all messed up.	0
B00012182G:this_is_how_they_get_you:t._castle	These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies. Do you see how this scam works??? They sell "FRESH WHOLE RABBIT" but when I order it, there's no head or skin! Can you believe?!	0
B000JSO76Q:no_spices_???:ginger	Where does it say "does not include spices"?  I was under the impression that the "Traditional Spice Box" would come with the traditional spices.  Very disappointed.  Even thought the stainless steel container is nice.	0

B0005YLTJW:best_is_now_worst:mcrumi	These used to be the best sardines before Bumble Bee bought King Oscar. 16-24 delectable Brisling sardines in excellent Olive Oil. Couldn't find better. Now, instead of the advertised small 16-24 Brislings, you will find 8-11 large bony and un-appetizing sardines. Crap	0

B0007NCH56:do_not_use_in_senseo:jennifer_lynn_hull_"4_under_5"	We bought these for the Senseo- the ad says it is compatable but its not! Buyers beware- I almost broke my Senseo trying to use them- The Senseo got stuck closed and I had to wait for it to let go of the vacuum. I think its because there is more coffee in these.	0
B0000DZBLD:credit_card_charged_for_items_not_in_stock:mark_guzowski	Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered.  My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts.  Having a credit card charged for items not in stock is *not* cool.  Beware	0

I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said "FRESH" and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could said that this cab was rare, but I though "Nah, forget it. Yo home, to Bel Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I said to the cabbie "Yo home, smell ya later!" Looked at my kindom, I was finally there, I could sit on my throne as the prince of Bel Air.   Love me sum Tuscan	0
B0000DJ80B:eh....:steven_t._moore_"zerostar39"	These were good burgers...BUT I did not find anything special about them. I could go to the supermarket near my house and get some ground beef and make my own for  A LOT less money, and they would taste just as good. These are good, but not worth the extra money	0
B0000SWYS8:too_little_for_too_much_!:stephen_d._everman	I ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy.  There is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound.	0
B000KJMIFG:plastic_popcorn_bowl:michael_crowell	I just paid $15 dollars (after shipping) for this cheap looking plastic popcorn bowl that was supposed to be a gift for my sister. Bah Humbug!!! Did I mention it is plastic. IT'S PLASTIC!!!!	0
B0002TA77A:first_excited,_then_disappointed....:lb	I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.	0

B0000DJ7RP:not_good!:sammy_squirrel	These "steaks" are only distantly related to real Prime Rib.  They are tasteless (other than being overly salted), have a texture reminiscent of congealed soy protein, and look even worse.  Omaha Steaks are at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to mail order meats, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere	0
B0006ZN4XE:honeyville_whole_powdered_eggs_are_"tasteless"!:scott_l._sutherland_"scottls1"	I have an Indian (American) friend, that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program. She has often made me "yummy/flavorfull" egg sandwiches (i.e. scrambled eggs...)!	0

B0000DIWL9:discontinued_and_no_notice!:jonathan_a._harmon_"unhappy_customer"	I waited and waited for an order from JD foods to come for a Xmas gift.

B00025A7PQ:bad_experience:a._sadek_"ahs"	I was very disappointed at quality of this steak.  It lacked any flavor, taste or texture.  Omaha steak should review this item	0
B000EVOSH6:wrong_item:buttah	I ordered this to give as a gift. I rec'd the package, opened it up and it was completely the wrong thing. Haribo had mislabled the box and what I rec'd was 5 lbs. of sugar coated gummy apples instead. I was very diappointed although Amazon was very understanding and refunded me the total amount.	0
B00032B9CS:vile:see_about_me_"firin_mah_lazar"	I'll admit it. The first three or so Cheetos actually taste pretty good. However, each one seems to taste worse, for some reason. And then there's the despicable Cheeto dust... You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender	0
B000FWAWVA:figures_don't_lie,_but_liars_figure:jason_tovey_"java_boy"	Don't get me wrong -- I'm not some nut job who thinks this stuff will give you cancer due to lack of testing.  I'm just really miffed at the fact that Splenda has plenty of carbohydrates in it -- 24 grams per cup!!  They get away with this by setting their serving size to 1 tsp, which is 0.5g.  Would you believe that in 0.5g of product there is less than one gram of carbohydrate!?  No way!!	0
B0000DZFJ0:paella_stay_away!:b._duncan_"duncs5"	Regardless of the even heating advertisement.  This pan is a very thin carbon steel and produces very uneven heating even using low/medium heat.  It rusted even after seasoning before the first use.  Got one use out of it	0
B000JZ8V0W:overpriced:jeanbur	This product is overpriced.  I found 11 oz. bags of this at the local grocery store for $3.49, which is 31.7 cents/oz.  This gives $12.22 for the 38.5 oz. bag featured here.  And there ordinarily would be a further discount for buying it in a larger size bag.  The candy is good, but it seems better to look for it in your local store	0
B0000DJ86X:these_have_gone_way_downhill_in_quality:rko_"radiopictures"	Years ago, these really were ground steak burgers with a very special flavor.  The most recent shipment I had was tastless with an unusually chewy texture.  Not recommended	0

B0004M15MQ:not_real_cadbury:t._elston	When I purchased the candy bar I thought I was I was buying the real Cadbury from England but to my mistake it turned out to be the same candy I can buy in any store. Can you belive I had it shiped to my house	0
B0007WULVY:expensive_and_anemic_little_things:m._j._burak	I couldn't believe the price for these berries, and they're a third of the size they should be.  I'll stick to buying mine from the local Asian foods grocery at $3.25 a pound	0
13029	This has a wonderfully intense ginger flavor, without managing to be overwhelming.  I cannot speak about its effectiveness in combatting motion sickness, though it did do a good job settling an upset stomach.  That being said, whatever ends up getting you interested in this product, whether it be the flavor or the other properties of ginger, this is definitely a candy you will want in your candy dish, desk, etc.  My only suggestion is to buy more than one at a time, because the flavor is so good that you will go through these rather quickly	1

97892	I have to say, growing up my marshmallow Cream always came out of a jar, so half way through the jar you'd have to put your hand inside and get it all sticky.  Now with this tub with a wide mouth, my hands aren't sticky.  PLUS because it has no carbs or sugar, I can eat more straight then I ever could... without having to worry as much either	1
116232	Come on America! What ever happened to trendiness. Albiet I got my Pocky from a local Walmart, but geeze! It is so good and has very few sugars for how much chocolate is on each stick. Sure it is a tad pricy being at around 88 cents for about 14 Pocky sticks, but once you taste it you NEVER will want to go back to Oreos.	1
121219	When i got my gummi bears, they were kinda stuck together and kinda hard. but it's still good.	1
127296	I am a huge black licorice fan, however I don't think I'd really experienced black licorice until I had Panda black licorice. Great, intense licorice flavoring, extremely addictive.  If I open up a box, I find it very hard to stop munching until the box is empty!  Delicious	1
140382	I lived in Japan for many years & really enjoyed using these "noodles" in soups, stir-fry, Korean-style cooking, etc.  If you are looking for pasta, these may not exactly match your craving, but are nonetheless really versatile!  My advice for those who don't like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them, sprinkle liberally with salt & rub through with clean hands, then rinse in cold water.  This is how they prepare them in Japan - it removes any odor & they are ready to use	1
199756	I like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea.  It has a great taste and is not super sweet.  I find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate.  Unlike the other person I am not addicted, but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies.  If you like green tea I think you will like these.  I drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it.  Nice refreshing candy.  Individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time	1
260941	wow, i thought they stopped making these! when i was younger i used to run up my street to the store just to buy some. they were so sour, but so good	1
263183	my friend told me how she loves these YummyEarth lollipops, so I bought a bag to share at work.  everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days.  really packed with great flavor.  different than other candy.  very fruity and real tasting, not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy.  just awesome taste.  pretty cool, too, that it's organic	1
277047	It ain't spaghetti, folks, but used properly it can enhance your eating. It's great in a wet, soupy type dish. Eaten "as is" (after rinsing) the noodles are very soft and tender, too soft to pass for a dry Italian type pasta, unless you always cook dry pasta to death. Boiling them for a minute or two firms them up somewhat, but they never become as firm as a properly cooked dried pasta.	1
323579	these are so good, my mom buys them all the time. i went to school with them one time and got my ex- friend addicted to them	1

384568	My husband is a big fan of this instant tea and always claims that it got rid of his cold/sickness right away. I have always thought that he exaggerated it until I was so cold and feeling really sick after a 2 hr working outdoor in the cold. The first thing I did after I came home was making a cup of hot ginger instant tea (which take me about 5 sec) and drank it right way. I have to admit, it is like a miracle! My nose almost stopped running right away. My headache was also so much better. I could feel the warmth running down and really warmed up my whole body.	1

490449	The taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me.  Mens is the name perhaps because the 2 individual packs are so big.  When I first saw that I wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia.  Nope these are for everyone.  It is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate.  I cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time.  Share this with some friends.  Would be fun to have these for a party	1

545064	These lollipops are intense & delicious.  My kids love them, and so do my co-workers	1
566444	I bought a few bags of these noodles after reading a very favorable review of them on the Hungry Girl website, and I am glad that I did.  They work well in a number of different recipes, are filling, and add a "calcium boost" to the dishes I use them in, for very few calories.  These are not "pasta" type noodles, of course - the texture is different (softer and kind of "slippery"), and they have virtually no flavor of their own - they take on the flavor of whatever sauce or dressing you use with them.  I probably won't use these noodles with European-style or American-style sauces such as marinara or cheese sauce - those types of sauces were created for grain-based pastas, which these are not.  On the other hand, these noodles are fine in such Asian recipes as Pad Thai, Lo Mein and Dan-Dan Noodes (basically, noodles in a spicy peanut or sesame sauce).  There are a lot of Asian-style recipes in cookbooks and on the Internet which are fairly easy to make, taste terrific, and work beautifully with these noodles.  You can prepare yourself a real treat, if you use these noodles in the types of recipes that work well with their texture, and for a fraction of the calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice.  In short, if you attempt something like spaghetti with meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles, you're likely to be disappointed, but if you use them in Pad Thai, any type of curry, other Asian dishes, or most soups, you're likely to find yourself enjoying a delicious and wonderfully low-cal, low-carb meal.	1
566868	this curry assortment is a great way to sample different curries at a very affordable price and curry pastes are a very quick and easy way to spice up almost any dish	1

This is wonderful, aromatic tea that makes the whole house smell great when you brew it, and it's so delicious - falls in the category of "comfort food"	1
B0007XPS98:market_spice_tea_-_terrific:e._wexler	Tea, of course, is a matter of taste and this one fits my taste to a tee (p.i.). I'm generally not a tea drinker but was first given this product as a gift. That was five years ago and I'm hooked. We even moved to Europe and I get it sent over here	1
B00017LF24:really_tastes_better!:k._kondo	I've been trying to buy this off the shelf and just could not find it (for, like, 2 years).  I mainly wanted it for texture -- table salt is not fine enough.  This stuff is so fine it completely changes the flavors.  I wouldn't have believed it myself	1

All I can say is, UMMMMMMMMMMM!  With a lite coating of koshers salt and pepper, drizzeled a little bit of EVOO ontop and layed them on the grill on a nice high flame.  They were cooked to perfection in about 10 minutes!  I just went back and orderd 12 more since they are on sale right now	1
B00023PCN0:tasty,_sprightly_and_delicious!:snowbrocade	Earl Grey is supposedly the second most popular tea in the world. Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas, usually Chinese and Indian teas, sometimes with a smokey flavor, and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot. Earl Grey tea has an interesting history. Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey's men. Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea.	1

B000E3VA0W:simple_to_make...delightful_to_eat!__:s._warner	Very sophisticated, complex flavor not normally found in a mix. Great alone, or as a base for your own creative additions. It gets so thick, it could be reduced a bit further and used as a bean dip. I added more water at the end of cooking for a looser, soupier consistency. We finished each bowl with a sprinkling of chopped jalapeos, cilantro and scallions which added a hit of brightness to the smoky undertones.	1
B0004M0248:god_i_love_this_stuff...destroys_the_competition:hangar_18	Rings-Ding's are the best snacks out there for many a reasons. First off, they are the best after dinner snacks out there. It's really like a cake, just more condensed and not as fatty or filling. Also, these things are addicting. In my life, I cannot even count how much packs I have consumed, since I have been eating these things everyday since I was young, and let's just say now I am very old. If you cannot afford drugs, then go for the ring-ding's. The only negative about these things if there isn't enough cream, then you get a mouthful of chocolate. Most people I know like the chocolate, but I personally would not like a mouthful of it. Another bad thing is in the summer, they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated. They kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer, which makes this the perfect snack for the winter.	1
B0000DBN1L:india's_original_spiced_milk_tea.:themis-athena	In many languages around the world, "chai" simply means "tea." In India, however, the word denotes a specialty that to tea lovers even in the West is fast becoming what cappuccino already is to coffee lovers: spiced milk tea.	1

B0000DBN1O:earl_grey_kicked_up_a_notch:miami_review_"ryan"	First of all let me say that this is what Black Tea is suppose to TASTE like. As soon as I took a sip of this tea earlier today, I knew that this is one of Tazo's finest tea. I'm not going to say that I've tasted many Earl Grey teas, because the only other Earl Grey Tea I've tasted is Twinings. But this tea in my opinion added a twist that was needed for Earl Grey Tea. Don't get me wrong Earl Grey Tea is fine the way it is, but the scented citrus bergamot added by Tazo makes a difference.	1

B0000GH6WY:much_better_than_most_powdered_milk:cooleric1234	I had this stuff almost every day while living in Chile for 2 years. Let me tell you, there is almost no comparison with the non-fat milk we drink here in the states. This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it. If you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up	1

B000BVY02M:hot,_hot,_hot:greg_s._saunders	Hottest Sauce in the Universe: no brag, just fact. I find that a single drop of Dave's Ultimate Insanity is more than equivalent to TEN drops of Tabasco. Why not five stars? While this sauce gives new meaning to the term extreme heat, I find the taste of Tabasco more pleasant. Ultimate Insanity adds a hint of a smokey/burnt flavor, which I assume is due to the roasted peppers. Try it for yourself..this the most heat you can get without notifying the Fire Marshall	1

More of an end-of-the-night activity... unless you're just having a dessert party of course! My one complaint is the impractical (although oh-so-whimsical) tissue packaging. It is hazardously absorbent. Even the assertive flavors of these high-quality chocolates are not enough to ward of infringing odors from nearby pantry items. Note: do not store next to your curry sampler...	1

B0001CXS4W:best_bagged_green_tea:matthew_dana	You can get better tea if you're willing to deal with leaves, but that's not practical for most of us, especially for those who drink it at work like I do. Compare this to a budget-brand bagged green tea (like Salada, which I used to drink), and you'll be able to tell the difference right away. The Tazo isn't overbearingly flavorful (no green tea is), but its subtle "green" taste is addictive (as is the caffeine!)	1

B000F959NO:wonderful!:t._m._griffin	This tea is just like you will find at the Thai restaurant. I find it best to brew in the coffee maker, making it very strong and adding water to it later. I use about one cup of loose tea to 8 cups of water in the coffe machine. When it's all brewed and hot, I add the sugar, more water and keep it in the fridge. I add evaporated milk as needed, per each glass. It's a wonderful drink for a summer day	1

It's smooth and creamy, like drinking a dark chocolate bar.  And it's not fattening.  Only 100 calories dissolved in 1/3 c. milk; yet it seems to make about 1/2 cup.  That's all you need.  It's rich, filling, and very satisfying.  I just wish amazon had the complete list of products.  This is not for people that like hershey's chocolate!	1

B0003054IA:sad_to_see_them_go...:justin_cardinal	Having lived in what I consider the coffee capitol of the United States, Portland, I am confident in my personal assertion that Torrefazione Italia was the finest coffee shop out there. The environment was warm and exotic while the coffee was second to none, poured by authentic baristas. Now that these coffee shops have been closed by Starbucks I am thrilled to still be able to purchase the beans here on Amazon. Give them a try and I bet you won't go back to whatever it is that you are drinking now.	1
B000GB24SY:great_taste!_:r._coley_"pizicato5"	I use this powder to make the Jamba Juice equivalent of the Matcha Green Tea Blast. It does a great job in reproducing the taste. I'd recommend this supplier	1
B00020USMS:the_world's_best_cold_remedy.:j._hoelscher_"debater7"	The product description calls the Orangettes "Belgian Vitamin C."  Except for the luxury price, I'm sure Belgians must be pretty healthy with these around.  They're amazing!  The combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular, but Leonidas does it very well.  The dark chocolate is very rich, not bitter, and completely covers the orange peel (which retains a good flavor and isn't overly sweet).  Unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially, Leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion.  The result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the Orangettes aren't so sweet as to become cloying.	1
B00014VTNW:fast_shipping_&_good_service:media_marsha	The item arrived in a timely manner and was represented correctly.  I'll use this company again	1
B00014VTNW:secret_pleasure__&__nutritional_powerhouse:mtspace_"reader,_cook,_gardener,_critic"	My first culinary memory involves a surreptitious finger dip into the Marmite jar at the age of three; it is the first food I remember really loving. And ever since then I have had difficulty getting enough of it.  Not everyone reacts to it the same way.  Some imagine it looks too much like axle grease.  Others complain that it smells too much like beer left overnight  to go bad.  These facts suggest that one might only serve it to close friends and only when there are some alternatives. In any case, the Marmite claim "Love it or Hate it"  is quite apropos.  It rarely evokes a neutral reaction.	1

B0007ZSN9S:you_think_godiva_makes_good_chocolates!:affineur_"foodie"	When we traveled in Belgium some years ago, we were constantly tempted by chocolate.  There was a Godiva store on every corner with uniform overstuffed waxy tasting chocolates.  Someone suggested we try Leonidas, and it was a revelation!! Half the  price of Godiva's chocolates and lightyears more flavorful and more like the artisanal chocolates that are so popular now.  The flavors were more interesting, the finish more refined, and the dark chocolate more full of cocoa bitterness and depth.  Leonidas is IT as far as Belgian chocolates are concerned	1

I was getting married 2 months after him and needed a diet buddy.  Since we worked & lunched together it was perfect.  He was eating pasta one day and told me that I could have pasta too as long as it's Dreamfields.  He suggested that I buy the Victoria's Organic Tomato & Basil sauce it's lower in carbs (4 net carbs per cup).  I bought it and added a splash of red wine, a bit of garlic, some fresh frozen basil leaves crumbled up and a dash of salt and pepper.  I had a low carb spaghetti dish that my Italian fiance drooled over... haha!  Good stuff.  Just be sure to follow the directions so that it's not over cooked ;o)	1

I usually put a spoon full in a huge plastic cup (like McDonalds large) with bottled water and heat for 4 minutes in microwave, remove, stir, and strain into large coffee mug.

As a gift however, this is a great box (there is a similar all heart shaped box for Valentines - which is cool if you dig hearts).  It fits all the qualities I look for in a gift.  Its extravagant, its something the person I give it to will love, and its something they wouldn't get themselves.  I tried 2 of these, the mixed berry is ridiculously good.  The peanut butter and jelly was interesting.  Everything is superb quality wise.  I knock it down a bit on price, but honestly, its tough to find fault in this product.  It much much better than regular Godiva (which I find to be super sweet and overpriced)	1

B000BVNSFW:not_the_best_quality,_but_okay_for_the_price:cydd_tan	Teas vary greatly in quality and the price reflects that.  This is a moderately price matcha tea so don't except the best flavor.  It is nutritious so it may be better as a flavor additive to drinks, desserts, broth, etc.  Real matcha can also be bitter and an acquired taste.  Japanese often drink it with tiny sugar candies to offset the bitterness.  Matcha also contains a lot of antioxidants so it may be helpful to some to stat incorporating it into their diet.  If you don't like the taste an easy drink is to mix it with orange juice	1

If you can order ahead of time you won't go wrong with this basket.	1

B0007R9L5Q:very_tasty!:a._lee	This was the first Tasty Bite Entree product that I bought.  I though it was very good, and very authentic-tasting.  There is a lot of sauce, and you do need some rice or bread to sop up the sauce.  There was not a lot of paneer cheese in the first packet I tried, maybe three small pieces.  Still, it is an excellent product	1
B0002MS59E:superb_flavors:mary_g._walters_"merniewlt"	Unlike other oriental noodles you buy, this product has superb flavors and great noodle quality that does not break down.

B0000GHNT0:nice_kick,_great_flavor,_good_on_anything.:eric_gibson	I love hot sauce.  I have been a big fan of other "insane" hot sauces, but the problem with them is that for the most part, they cannot be put directly on food, instead, they need to be diluted before they're okay for consumption.	1
B0006ZN4Z2:orgasmic:s._goldberg_"gourmet_snob"	These are the best berries I've ever tasted!  I thought for sure they were sweetened, but they're not.  The berries they used must have been perfectly ripe and the flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them.  Additionally, the slices are whole, with very little breakage in the can.  The value you get is pretty great, considering that 8oz of berries is approximately equivalent to 5# of fresh strawberries.  At $3/lb (+ shipping) that's really not bad, and you can have these year-round, even when strawberries aren't in season	1

B000CINE8A:a_lot_of_marzipan!:r._pearson_"avid_reader"	I purchased this for an Oktoberfest party, there was a lot left over, mostly because people were slightly intimidated or mostly really drunk.  The sweet tasted nicely and were decorated in a very pretty way.  I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to make their own marzipan and needs to purchase a large quantity.  There are several little "flats" of the candies so you can package them seperately or give a flat away to a friend easily enough	1

Then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes.  I was obsessed with finding these bricks.  I went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail.  Finally, on Amazon, I found them!  Whew.  I didn't want to have to travel all the way back to France to get them!	1

B000K7644E:red_sea_salt:caitlin_warde	The Red Sea Salt has a earthy flavor; it is slower to dissolve on the tongue.

B000E5GJRE:a_great_dish_if_you_are_craving_quick_thai,_but_i_usually_add_a_bit_of_chicken!:gensparkie	This is a delicious basic Thai yellow curry, with some vegetables. It comes with a little pouch of cooked rice to soak up the sauce and balance the meal, but I still found that with this meal, I really crave some chicken or some heartier addition like paneer cheese cubes, nuts, or eggplant. I don't have any Thai places in my area, so I add some chicken and pine nuts to round it out and it really helps that Thai craving. The sauce is delicious and the veggies are crisp	1
B0003054XA:it_is_best_!!:polkadotty	My first and last beverage review.  I am gob smacked by this coffee.  What's that complex flavor?  I don't know but I've never had better and I've tried a lot of brands, gourmet and not so.  Smooth, nutty, winey, woodsy, whatever who cares I love it.  Maybe it's all that caffeine racing through my veins (I'm on my third cup) but I'm about ready to dance and break into song.  A polka would be nice.  Plus the fact that it's dedicated to a cat is extremely sweet.  And they practice social and environmental responsibility with their growers.  Way to go Seattle.	1

B0001NYC46:nice_product,_but_with__limitations:dustin_georgemiller_"folk/bluegrass_dj,"	I received the Fresh Roast Plus 8 as a 30th birthday present from my parents, which has allowed me to take my coffee snobbery to an entirely new level!  This model has worked admirably in the 2+ months I've had it, roasting one batch at least every two days.  It's not automatic (there isn't a good roaster that is) and you need to carefuly monitor color, aroma, and "cracks" to achieve a consistent roast, but the coffee it produces is balanced, consistent, and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store.	1
B000GHUD86:about_as_easy_and_effective_as_sprouting_can_be:f._webb	The Easy Sprouter is a great vertical sprouter. The seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes. The inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides. Maintaining your growing sprouts (for most seed types) means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds, allowing excess water to drain off, and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup. Doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling, moist enough not to dry out, but never remaining in standing water. Most seeds need to be pre-soaked initially, and this step can be managed directly in the Easy Sprouter. There are three lids: two lock into place - one with air holes, one without. The third is domed, but doesn't actually lock onto the cup.	1

The granules are the size of the salt on a hot pretzel--but that is where the similiarities end.  The salt dissolves instantly on the tongue; it has no bitter or cloying aftertaste.  The jar suggests it be used  on grilled fish and salads, but I would reccomend it in lieu of table salt also.	1

When do you see that in the age of computer print outs. I thought it was an extra touch as far as customer service. I will be returning to this company again.	1
B0002QEL98:could_use_it_all_day!:monid_"monica"	A friend brought me a large bottle back from his trip to Mexico.  I threw out all the other store bought vanilla bottles I had.  They do not compare to this one.  It has a strong, rich flavor.  I add to it everything I can.  My chocolate chip cookies and french toast could not be complete without Molina Vanilla	1
B0000CCZUW:excellent_quality,_super-fast_to_make_--_and_healthy!:esther_schindler	The only refined sugar in this brownie mix is in the chocolate chips; otherwise, it's naturally sweetened. And it's easier to put together than are the mundane supermarket brands: add one egg, butter or oil (or applesauce, if you're an oil-free person), and a little water. Throw it in a 350-degree oven for 20 minutes. That's it.	1
B000E5DKLW:excellent_midnight_snack.:john_thorne	This is one of my favorite Tasty Bite entres. It is spicy hot, but not at all too hot, with a noticeable "curry" flavor. The addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note (although I could do without the whole chile pod). I take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just-before-bed stomach warmer, but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick, easy, and tasty lunch, far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles. By the way, the combination of pured greens and green peas is a terrific idea. I'd give this five stars if the peas weren't a little too redolent of the can. And, with the free shipping, this is a terrific price.	1

B000BXKVJQ:a_great_product_to_take_on_vacation!:leanne_burroughs_"leanne_burroughs,_author_of_highland_wishes_and_her_highland_rogue"	As someone who absolutely hates water, Crystal Light was a life saver for me.  Now that they make it in little packets 'to go,' I can put several in my purse when I go on business trips or vacation and feel good about buying bottled water.  I'm doing what doctors suggest we all do - drink lots of water - yet doing it with something that makes it taste good!	1
B0000CE40F:love_them:dahne	I love these cookies, especially the chocolate chip.  They are great for a snack and can be quite addicting.  They are made from all-natural ingredients and whole wheat flour.  The cookies are crispy small animal shapes with a few chocolate chips, and not too sweet.  I do wish the cookies had more chocolate chips, but besides that, I can't get enough of these cookies	1
B0000TJLNS:i_love_this_spice_rack!:james_decker	I've been wanting this for a while now, and I finally bought it.

B0002CRZRW:my_favorite_green_tea!:wenfei	The pouch is vacuum sealed and holds about 100gms of delicate, deep-emerald, leaves. I use about a tsp for a 12-16oz cup. It is very important to avoid using boiling water if you want to get the full benefits and flavor of this tea. Water at a rolling boil will overcook the tea and you will notice that the tea quickly turns brown in the cup. If you adhere to directions and use water at 80 deg. C., you will be left with a wonderful cup of GREEN tea that stays green. I absolutely love the fresh, grassy flavor of this tea and it is a wonderful pick-me-up. The first sip of this tea leaves a distinctly sweet note on the tongue even though there is no actual sugar in the tea! I have spent hundreds on different teas, but I keep returning to this one as my staple	1

They're a legit superfood, however, the price is outrageous.  If you're comparing them with a dried snack fruit like raisins, they're 8x the cost (for organic). If paying $6 for an afternoon snack is up your alley, then there probably isn't a much better snack for you than these Goji berries.	1

B0000TL5WS:this_does_the_whole_thing:stephen_c._rose	I use this -- for the most part -- instead of bread. I am Bi-Coastal and I keep these in the freezer both home in NYC and out West. I will have one or two a day and that is it for bread products. Two is 120 calories. You can use them to wrap anything you like. If you want some tensile strength just leave one on the counter for a while before using. This has cache. Who wouldn't want a crepe as a sort of ultimate gourmet taco? Not knockin' tacos or bread, but if you are a minimalist like me you want few things that are great. These take up no room. You can order them in bulk. Among my uses -- to wrap concoctions I create and make a meal. YYou do not neeed much of a concocktion. Max two tablespoonfuls. To put melted cheeze on and wrap up and make a meal. To put a spoonful of icecream on and wrap up and make a treat. To put a bit of preserves on and roll up for my equivalent of a treat. And you know what? When you do not need any, they are still there, taking up little room and available whenever you get the urge. Bread substitute? Well, everyone needs bread. I still go out for breakfast in NYC and will have a Bialy. But before I used to do three bialy's worth of bread a day. I have cut that by more than half. As far as I know this is the only product like this. I am well satisfied. Class act from California	1

Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it	0
B000H3VRDE:not__compatible_with_senseo_machines:toonces	Melitta coffee is certainly one of the better brands, and I really like that each pod is individually wrapped.  I bought this because the Senseo Hazelnut was not in stock at the time.  Caution Senseo coffee maker users: The Melitta pod does not fit well in the Senseo pod holders.  The single pod holder is too small for the Melitta pod, and the double pod holder is too big for one Melitta pod, too small for two Melitta pods.  I found the coffee to be just a bit on the weak side, but this may only be because I used it in a Senseo machine.	0
B000GAO9ZG:a_real_review:k._r._iwanicki	Really strange cardboard mushy texture. Flavor can be sickening at times, but you get used to it. I won't buy this again. I am not sure this is even beef, has a strange taste. Not sure where the other reviews came from??	0

B0007NOWMW:hoorible_i_want_my_money_back:miji_kim-chang	I bought these pods on Amazon because they were a dollar cheaper than at the local grocery store.  Now I know why.  When I opened the package the Senseo Watermark was faint or hardly visable and it took me 3x the amount of pods to make a decent cup of coffee.  Buyer beware,  I am back to buying pods at the grocery store.	0
B000HZIL68:faulty_cups_caused_grounds_in_my_coffee:donna_l._minton	I had trouble getting the cups to function properly without getting grounds in my coffee.  At first I thought it was my coffee maker but the other brand of coffee I use worked fine.  Sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes to finally find a cup that would work correctly without getting grounds in my coffee.  Most of the time I would just give up.  Again, the other brand of coffee I use NEVER does this.	0
B000E39U6S:husband_described_the_first_forkful_as_"an_abomination".:kate_minola_"editor"	Great idea poorly executed with an extremely unappetizing presentation.

B000FFS04S:the_tea_is_better_than_the_box,_which_is_not_saying_much._:richard_larison	First of all, the Tea Chest is disappointing to say the least.

B000FBQ5SU:strange_taste!:jacqueline_cooke	I absolutely agree with the two other reviewers.  I had very high hopes too as I use McCann's Brown Bread mix ALL THE TIME - I don't think I could live without it, so I was very disappointed with the Fruit Scones Mix.  There is a very weird taste, to me it seems like 'soapy' or something, but definitely not a pleasure to eat.  I've got tons of bags left of this mix which I will have to throw away.  I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND this product, sorry	0
B00009KF1J:yuck!:k._barlow_"kelly_b"	When I think "dark roast" I think full bodied and DARK.  Melitta pods are the worst I've tried.  I've tried Senseo pods too which are only mediocre.  I did find the Target brand "Archer Farms" pods to be the BEST.  The French Roast really does rival Starbucks home brewed.  Its cheap too...3.99 for 18 pods.  If you like a full bodied, rich, dark and strong cup of cofee, don't do Melitta.  I found Senseo and Archer Farms pods fit in my Melitta pod brewer just fine	0
B000CMD4SG:wretched:m._khaghani	"Highest quality, wholesome ingredients" my Aunt Ida.  Seriously.  HOW do companies get away with this nonsense??? The first ingredient is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar.

B000GW46FM:yummy_beef,_gross_cheese:c._yu_"blo0op"	I had bought this before as a snack at the store and i love the combination of the beef and the white cheddar.  I figure i would try to buy it bulk instead of paying $2 a pack at the store.  However, I'm not sure if it was stored too long in the warehouse or if it was too hot in the warehouse, but the cheese was disgusting!  it was dry and crumbly and had this awful taste.  I even opened a second and third pack to see if it was a fluke, but all of the packages were like this.  The beef stick was good, however, if i had to order again, i'd order the product without the cheese.  It just was not fresh.  (and yes, i did check the expiration date and it wasn't expired	0
B000GBQV2Y:meh...not_bad...not_great.:d._thomas_"geekforhire"	Pretty OK coffee. Nothing special, but I suppose its a fair deal for the price. We picked up the pack of 3 as an emergency stash, and it has worked well for that, but its not my caffeine deliver system of choice ;-) Of course, my coffee of choice is over three times the cost of this stuff, so the comparison is not very fair	0
B000EM7AKW:ummmm,_no_thanks......:j._busfield	This "snack" (lol) tastes like cheese that had been baked in the oven for about a month. Kinda looks like it too.  Make sure you have a beverage near by when you try them...very very dry	0

But they are not thinking about their target consumer CHILDREN	0
B000FBMW3W:watch_your_cupper_!:abstract_qit_gratner_"qhrixie"	I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.

B000FGZM2U:broken_most_of_the_time:joan_may_"foodie"	I LOVE the flavor of this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged.  Packaging needs to contain a little TLC, then it would be 5 stars.  Don't order if you need this for a certain dinner, it may not arrive usable	0
B000EMZ23Y:rancid,_chemical-laced_nuts:susan_b._"from_the_home_of_the_indianapolis_500"	While the flavor is unique, three of the five packets of nuts were rancid!

B000FED3SW:tastes_good_but_should_have_a_warning_label--causes_gas!:e._siemens	Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!	0
B000F70OZ4:too_close_to_sell_by_date:munchies_organic	The sell by date on a package was less than a month.  So that they would not go bad, I felt like I needed to personally eat more than I would have.  I have a retail store and I need a bit more time on new products.  This was a costly mistake.  Also, the "wholesale price" from the business itself was the same as Amazon's price except Amazon gave free shipping AND a discount coupon worth ten bucks!  Cool deal beans Amazon!  As a retailer, I would think that I would be able to get a better deal from Betty Lou's or get a reasonable sell by date.  Very tasty and addicting	0
B0002J5FMC:false_and_misleading_listing:branch_fellowship	Home and Beyond and True Value offers this 12 pack of coffee filters with 40 in each pack. I ordered two 12 packs of 40 coffee filters each and Home and Beyond only sent two packs of 40. Not the 24 packs I ordered and paid for. My advice is do not do business with Home and Beyond or True Value when buying these coffee filters because they do not ship what the listing says. Until Amazon starts enforcing Home and Beyond and True Value to honor what they list in their offerings, IMHO then the buyers need to go somewhere else. Weight says 4.20 pounds. Are they trying to say one tiny pack of 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds??	0

A lack of flavor and dry texture makes me wonder if by "palm oil" they meant to write "socks".  Thoroughly disappointing, I only finished the one jar I bought because peanut butter is a staple in my diet and I wasn't about to waste it.

B000E4ARCI:powdery_-_and_short_shelf_life!:atl_chris_"atl_chris"	I wouldn't describe this jerky as shredded but instead as powdered. It's not something you can tap into your hand and eat like a snack. The best use we found was to pour one of the little tubes onto a salad for added protein.

Due apparently to a small air leak in the packet so moisture can get in (only my personal theory).  I just pound on the packet with a knife handle to break it up and use it anyway but it is a problem.  And they have known about it now for a long time, seems like they would have solved the problem....	0

B000FNCTJC:not_worth_any_calories!:k._leitz_"film/farm-girl"	I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.  The texture was similar to a protein bar.

Not a pleasant experience.  I didn't finish either of them	0

B000FFLXQ0:unusual_disappointment_for_ener-g:arealavfan	I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration.  Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit.  How wrong I was.  The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste.  You would think "thin" and "heavy" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say.  By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor.  I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first.  I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it.  It was an expensive lesson.  But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products.  Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten	0
B000CORSF4:too_sweet!:beach_lover	I made the mistake of purchasing this 12 pack without testing it at the stores first due to glowing reviews on this site.  I have a sweet tooth but these were so sweet that it was nauseating.  I couldn't taste any caramel or other flavor, just straight sugar. If you are considering this product and haven't tasted it before, I highly recommend you purchase a small bag first so you don't waste your money	0
B000CQE3KA:eh?:lovinglife	I accidently picked these --- I really wanted the hot fries.  These just are not as good.  I guess if you like cheddar they are okay	0
B000CR41JW:yuck!:a._boyd_"boydbrain"	I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large..	0
B000CSEINK:misleading_labeling:slo_amy_"apcds99"	I thought this product had reasonably good taste, but I have two major issues with it.	0
B000FNPM0K:hard_rasins,_not_tneir_best:albert_i._reiner	not my favorite of their products. The rasins are Hard and sometimes Burnt, it takes to long to soften.	0
35847	If you dont like mangos, you will not like this drink. It does not taste like an "organic" mango, but rather, it tastes more like the "essence of mango" you would smell from an air freshener. This does mix pretty well with cold rum.	1
161871	These are by far the best tasting Spirulina bars in the market. The  whole line is more desert like in concept, so of course they are sweet & chewy. People with IBS probably should not eat finely chopped raw nuts and should read ingredients before buying!!	1
173356	These nibs are great on ice cream or with cool whip.  Not good alone, but paired with a sweet they are great.  I am going to try cookies next week!  I have already bought more	1
190437	These cheddar bunnies are now a favorite in our house.  Better tasting and cuter than goldfish crackers, these are a good snack to give to your kids, or eat yourself.  I was very pleased with this purchase	1
256176	Excellent. One of the few food items I've found on here that I think I'll buy again. Remember that it's best chilled/ice cold, if you're ever gonna sample it. Not so good when not so cold, great when actually cold. Very refreshing feel either way, though, after you've had a drink	1
277829	Good low sodium low sugar granola that I feel I can't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues	1
282210	These individually wrapped Slim Jims make great snacks for hungry kids.  Toss a few in your purse and you have a portable, filling treat while you're out with the kids.  My kids love them and ask for them over fruit snacks or candy	1
331845	I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.	1
409438	Couldn't find this item in any stores in my town, so I went to Amazon (naturally) and found it!  The item was delivered on time, too!  Thanks, Amazon	1
435494	Just the right size snack pack for my 17-month old.  Healthier alternative to other packaged crackers without sacrificing taste	1
534399	Zico Coconut water tastes as natural as it is from a coconut.  If you never had coconut water before I would suggest drinking one before buying a pack of 12.  Some people may say it's an aquire taste, but I think most importantly it all depends on what culture you were raised.  I started drinking coconut water ever since I was a baby.  It's very healthy and low in sugar.  Currently I give it to my [...] son as part of his snack instead of the high sugar content of orange juice or other juices	1
B000E176PW:taste_great!:aprils	My whole family love these crackers. It's nice that they are organic with no artifical ingredients or hydrogenated oils. The only thing I wish is that they were whole grain!	1
B000F2AE90:dr_kracker_flatbread_pumpkin_seed_cheese_7oz:beverly_j._bartey	I love these crackers and was suprised to find them on amazon.com I first found them in Reading Pa and here in florida could not find them.  High fiber is important to me and these have more than most.	1
B000H6UX04:brazil_blend_-_muito__delicioso!!:ernie_and_karen	We spent 5 years in Brasil and Senseo has captured the essence of the premium cafe taste from some of the better Fazendas! Well done, particularly for a Dutch company	1
B000FL52IY:great_mild-medium_flavored_coffee:timothy_lawson_"ex-barista"	My wife and I have slightly different tasates in coffee, I like mine darker and she like a milder coffee.  This one however is just right for both of us.  I drink it daily without cream or sugar (which I only do when I actually enjoy the flavor of the coffee).  And we are on our second 5 pound bag!  I wish we had found this coffee sooner, it is great	1
B000E18CVE:hot_and_sour_soup:nancy_e._unger	I have purchased this item several times.  It is good and can be expanded by adding more vegetables or chicken.  It comes packaged well and is easy to prepare.  It is also in an environment friendly bowl which is important to me	1
B000FF9DWG:healthy_alternative_to_cheese_curls:dvb	These "cheese" sticks are irresistible. In fact, for a "substitute" they taste far better than the original. My kids love them, and 1 ounce pack fits perfectly into a lunchbox.	1
B000GARXRW:fantastic_taste_and_texture!:john_rokas	I don't think that it is possible to get better beef jerky for the price. My wife and two kids also find it to be delicious	1
B000CSEFQ0:great_for_college_students:m._g._collins_"troop_702"	Easy, convenient and tasty snack or breakfast.  Particularly good for college students	1
B000I1XLWA:gala_dutch_coffee:julijewel_"happy_in_the_mid-west"	I tried this coffee on a whim. My husband and I really enjoy our single serve coffee maker. We easily use up an 18-pak in 2 to 3 days between the grown children and us. This coffee has very smooth taste and mildly strong in flavor. It is a very nice coffee that can be enjoyed daily	1
B000EDDSE8:golden_flax_meal_is_the_better_one:wk_"wk"	This is a great product. The golden flax is slightly better tasting than the brown. Its good enough to put in muffins and (for us) toppings such as apple bake where you can taste it. We actually do consume enough to justify buying it buy the box. We also consume it in shakes but its best when baked- works great in cornbread too. We also get stone ground flours and cornmeals, and these three make up a lot of value in this department. Flax oil of course is very high in short chain Omega 3's. Fish oils are better, but if you have the other nutrients and enzymes in your body you can make the long ones from the ones in flax- hence this product fulfills this need very well (flax is very concentrated in short chain 3's). Did I mention it actually tastes great in baked goods? Bob's Red mill is a quality product	1
B000E4ARC8:you_may_not_be_able_to_stop_eating_this!:kdg_"econkate"	Wow - this beef jerky is so good it should come with a label: "Warning - Highly Addictive." Hands-down, the best beef jerky we've ever eaten. Moist, yet chewy, very satisfying. Not too salty. Lots of flavor. Think maybe I'll go eat some now...	1
B000FH2VO6:tastes_as_good_as_any_other_albacore_tuna_but_with_less_calories:a._bennett	Add Mayonaise to anything and I love it.  That is espcially true of this white albacore tuna.  Being packed in water lowers the calories and it's fat free but it needs something to moisten it.... like mayo.  It's delicious and totally clear of any dark tuna meat if you abhor even the slightest amount of dark tuna meat in your salad.  The tuna are supposedly wild caught in dolphin safe nets so are therefore hopefully lower in Mercury content.  Plus there is nothing added to the product so it's truly all natural.  I happen to like dark as well as white tuna but if you only like the white like so many of my family and friends then this is the brand to buy	1
B000GW68ZI:at_last!:k._mcgee	Flavored coffee creamers have been a guilty pleasure of mine for a long time now, but even if you buy the sugar-free kind, you're ingesting a whopping 1 gram of fat per tablespoon of creamer. As if that weren't bad enough, it's partially HYDROGENATED!	1
B000FL521G:good_-_natural_sugar_replacement:j._acree	Works great in coffee and tea, and can be used in baking as well.	1
B000FFS09I:best_ever_oolong_tea:gw_"woodbear"	First tried this tea from a specialty store in Buffalo, NY where it sold for close to $60/lb.  Love it, even though it was only 2 oz.  Search the net for this tea and found it Amazon.	1
B000GAO9ZG:beef_jerky:tennessee_stud_"ts"	This is one of the best beef jerkys  I have purchased, moist, tender, with a great flavor, I have tried the others that are like orginial dry and tough to chew, leaves your jaws tired...also a great price...best I have found...Will order agai	1
B000GAT7FI:flavor:amy_l._pikios	I love the flavor. It's in a world of it's own. It has great taste and textur	1
B000CR41CY:newman_o's_-_fantastic!:customer	My husband and I like the Newman O's better than Oreo's, and our 3 year old son loves them! As we did as a child, he pulls the cookies apart and eats the cream filling, just like an oreo. Also, the Newman O's do not have the harmful high fructose corn syrup that oreos still have	1
B000CR41CY:original_is_great,_wheat/dairy_free_is_a_bit_tough:k._bateman_"kathik"	I love the Original Vanilla Creme Newman's O's, so when I saw the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free on sale one day I picked one up. I figured it would basically be the same as the Original. The chocolate and vanilla tastes are great, but I found the cookies themselves to be rock hard. So unless you have an issue with wheat or dairy products, I would recommend the Original Vanilla Creme, and not the Wheat-Free/Dairy-Free variety	1
B000F2DNV6:best_tasting_nutrional_cracker_i've_ever_tasted.:r._a._miller	I saw this bread in my local health food store, and it looked so good I decided to try it.  I must say it taste just as good as it looks. This is by far the besting tasting cracker I've ever tasted.	1
B0007NOWMW:smooth:amazon_lover_"chris"	When I searched the net for pods there were lots of warnings that the senseo brand wasn't so good.  Granted I am not an avid coffee drinker,however I really look forward to a good morning cup of coffee that won't burn a hole in my stomach.  I usually run one senseo pod through twice and have a perfect cup.  If anything - needs a little more of the flavor (i.e. hazlenut, vanilla) added to it.  But still very good.	1
B000FIMW1M:sunstrike:mrs._patricia_g._mcgoldrick	These were very good cookies. I loved the texture and flavor. a nice surprise from a packaged cookie. I would buy again	1
B000F26YGM:amazing!:michele	I am addicted to these. They are delicious, not dry at all, and there are lots of crackers in each container. Yum!	1
B000H31UOU:top-notch_espresso_at_great_price:k._a._wallgren_"superswede"	Illy rules. My favorite espresso roast.  Great price.  Excellent.	1
B000EDBPJI:great_for_bread_and_noodles:joanna_daneman	Some people can tolerate spelt but not wheat --and if you are one of those, spelt flour makes a great bread. It substitutes well, but be aware that spelt requires less kneading (it has a shorter gluten fiber and breaks down if kneaded too long. We knead bread about three minutes.)	1
B000FMXR5S:great_buy--crunchier_than_bread_crumbs:d._p._taylor	Read about Panko in several cookbooks.  This was definitely the best buy out there--although I have enough to last me several years! Would recommend this product	1
B000E3XCF8:yummy!:annalee_blysse_"romance_author"	This is my favorite side dish. It is so versatile and so very easy to make. It tastes great with any and every kind of sausage I've ever tried. I love to make it when I whip up a batch of hot wings	1
B000F6UMI4:pretty_darn_good:m._whitehead	These bars are filling, which is what I look for in my snacks/breakfast foods.  They're nice and sweet, won't fall apart on you like granola bars, yet don't require too much jaw pressure to take a bite--it's the perfect consistancy.  A great way to get some portable protien if you don't want to carry around a bag of nuts/seeds with you	1
B000FGXREU:great!:dawn_michelle_bourgeois	I use this cereal for not only cereal, but also to make rice crispy treats. Yum	1
B000E48IO2:delicious_goodness:tanya_keeble	I really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands	1
B000FH2YY8:great_alternative_to_cow's_milk_for_toddlers:ella's_mom_"dw"	I started using goat milk when my daughter was 1 because she did not digest cow's milk that well. This product is great, has equal or more nutrition than cow's milk, has a good flavor, just slightly different than cow's milk,is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go, I don't have to worry about it spoiling I just mix and give it to my daughter	1
B0002E2GQU:full_vs._medium_roast_espresso_beans:petur_o._jonsson	Espresso beans can be roasted in different ways. Lavazza and Illy represent the best of two different approaches to roasting beans for  Italian espresso. Illy roasts their beans for a longer time, but at a lower temperature, than Lavazza. As a result of its higher roasting temperature the Lavazza is darker, and according to some people more robust, than Illy is.	1
B000E3VAOS:excellent:r._doskocil	I will never make home-made gumbo again, this is so easy and good. 30 minutes and you have great gumbo.	1
B000EDM6BO:makes_great_pudding:zinniagirl	Am always looking for new ways to get whole grains into our diet.  The pudding recipe on the back of the package is very good.  Even DH with incredible sweet tooth liked it	1
B000FNPMAK:great_breakfast_cereal!:dennis_w._blakeway	While I like all of the Kashi products I've tried, this one has to be my favorite! With a little fresh fruit, how much more healthy can you get? Great taste with seven grains and sesame! Perhaps the other reviewer threw away the cereal and ate the box	1
B000HZIL8G:mocha_java_-_k-cups:coffee_lover_in_gainesville_va_"coffee_lover_in_gainesville,_va"	Mocha Java is one of the smoothest cups you will ever have with a full bodied taste.  It is so mellow it is almost buttery.  I love it	1
B000EF3E4A:these_sardines_are_delicious!:a._bennett	I have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack.  I know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but I've never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea. And they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with Omega 3's too so it's as good for you as are the sardines.  However, I am not so sure about their actual mercury levels.  Buying them from Amazon with their $10. off sale on $49. purchases is a great price.  I've even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as Costco and BJ's NO longer carry this product.  Or their price has skyrocketed.  It's great to be able to stock pile them from Amazon.  If you like sardines, you'll love these! And they are just so nutritious for us all	1
B000GAV256:great_coffee..._great_generocity..._great_cause...:pastor_lisa_"spacemuffin"	We have served this coffee at our Sunday morning church services for 8 years... it is wonderful to know that we are not lining the pockets of some mega corporation when we buy from Pura Vida...but helping children and families. I heard one visitor who moved out of state and had not been in services for over 3 years say, "I knew I would get a great cup of coffee this morning!" ... we love this coffee	1
B000ED7M6I:my_favorite_cereal:nixiechick	I love this cereal; I eat it every morning with maple syrup or honey, raisins, and walnuts.  It is never pasty for me, as it is for the other reviewer, unless I let it cook way too long or let it sit to cool too long.  I cook it for five minutes, turn off the heat and let it thicken a couple of minutes more as I add my raisins and walnuts and maple syrup.  Then I stir in rice milk until I get it to the consistency I like.  Though I don't like rice milk by itself or on any other cereal, it does taste really good on this rice cereal, with the added benefit of making the whole thing easier to digest.  Rice cereal is the easiest cereal to digest, anyway, but adding rice milk instead of cow's milk makes it even more easier	1
B000DZDIYC:tasty:anonymous	These are quite good tasting!  Even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time, the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time.  It would be nice, as with most things, if they were a bit less expensive and also didn't have to be bought 'in bulk,' but overall they're very good especially compared to some other 'organic' offerings	1
B000F6WHMS:not_much_for_taste,_but_effect_is_very_good:walker_"inthe_reign"	I tried this item just because it's a a ginseng snack.  I found it to be not particularly tasty, but the overall effect of increased stamina is true.  I'm not sure about spirulina in general, but one ball per day does the trick for me when it comes to increased stamina lasting several days	1
B000F2DNU2:yum,_dr._kracker's_are_these_are_irresistible!:j._hight	I originally found these Flatbread crackers while traveling.  After returning home I longed for them, so Amazon came to the rescue with a source of these great flatbreads	1
B000CQY378:all_gone:l._fields	Everyone loved these pretzels. Very flavorful, not too salty. I plan on buying more from Amazon, best price I've found on this brand	1
B000FBQWEM:good_healthy_cereal:gloria_campos-hensley	I was really impressed by the taste of this cereal. I was expecting the flavor to be like cardboard or something like this, but instead it was really good. It was sweet (but not sugar sweet) and crunchy. I'll definitely buy this again. If the price went down I'd buy it more	1
B000EF3E54:i_love_anchovies:joyce_haibe	Ever since I returned from Spain, I have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas. These are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful. If you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza, you are missing a great treat. I highly recommend these, and even if you only eat them occasionally, they will remain fresh in the glass jars	1
B000GAT6MM:nutiva_hempseeds_bulk:andrew_alves	If you like hempseeds like I do. This is your best buy. Amazon has the best price. The seeds came fast, fresh, and are terrific. To me they smell and taste even more fresh then the retail packages. The 5 lb bag comes vacuum sealed. I took 5 mason jars, packed them in and put them in the freezer. I have a big bag in the refrigerator. I toss these seeds all over my salads. :	1
B000GFWI22:splenda_is_an_excellent_sugar_substitute.:a._fabun	I just began baking with Splenda when we found out my dad has pre-diabetes. For Easter I prepared a sugarless ricotta tart with Splenda and it worked beautifully. Everyone agreed that it didn't taste sugar-free and my dad really enjoyed it.	1
B000GFWI22:sweetness:edwin_lindell_"evil_poptart"	I'm a diabetic so I can't have sugar.  In my opinion Splenda tastes alot better than sugar and has no carbs from it.  So if you're a new found diabetic and you think life is over cause everything food wise sucks, just sub some Splenda in the recipe and you'll be good to go.	1
B000FMTJJQ:agave_experience:e._garvy	Agave nectar makes an exellant sweetner for cooking as well as for teas.	1
B000H31U4A:protein_punch:w._petersen	I've been using Nutiva products for years now and the protein powder is wonderful. I add it to a smoothie in the morning, and it keeps me going for hours. It's a staple in my diet, so I usually have one or two jars on hand. I highly recommend it	1
B000FBP1IA:you_have_to_try_this_cereal!:c._humphrey	My son loves this cereal!!!  I always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost $5 per box, so when it was on sale I would stock up.  I finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients.  He said he didn't like it as well, but I thought he was just imagining the difference.  Well, I decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn't really tell the difference.  He was able to identify the Panda Puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around!  He has even asked for a case of this cereal for Christmas!  Guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well.	1
B000H6UX0Y:better_tasting_than_the_dark_roast_pods:poodleranch	I loved the idea and ease of the Senseo, but I was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted.  The grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety, so I decided to take a chance and order the Columbia Blend from Amazon.  I have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what I had been getting.	1
B000F6SQ1O:the_best_cold_coffee_i've_had!:karla_kay_mason_"coffee_lover"	I've tried a lot of cold coffee drinks and this one wins on all counts (even over Frappacino). I have to have one every afternoon for a 'pick-me-up' treat! You will LOVE this, I'm on my 2nd case	1
B000F2AE9K:good_product,_but_past_sell_by_date:david_copperfield	I have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door. I received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week. However the "sell by" date on each package is a week old. They seem to be fresh enough now, but I am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date. It also makes me wonder about other Amazon orders and the sell by dates on them. I will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life	1
B000ETXO8M:the_real_salt:henthabox_"henthabox"	This is a good price for this amount of quality licorice.  This is the traditional Dutch concoction containing a strong salt taste and smell.	1
B000FIFE8K:very_good_but_don't_buy_from_amazon:factotum	I tried to order this here but was sent Tang instead. When I informed them of the problem, they resent the order and again I got Tang. Their system seems confused by the TANGerine description or they're just not very bright at the warehouse.	1
B000EMQEN6:very_fast_to_prepare:xrayspex	These instant potatoes are very tasty and so simple and fast to make.	1
B000FFS926:the_best_green_tea_you_can_get_in_a_bag...:b._mccarthy_"engineer,_cert,_amateur_radio_operator"	...and I've tried quite a few.  I tried over 30 varieties of green tea bags searching for a good cup, and this one takes the crumpet!  The flavor is strong but mild, the color golden brown, and the aroma is light.  I threw out all the others (or rather I gave them to my father-in-law who also like tea) when I found this one and I bought a case of it..	1
B000GAT6NG:nutiva_organic_coconut_oil:l_filippi	Love this.  Great substitute for shortening.  Keeps baked goods moister, and is excellent for cooking eggs and vegetables.	1
B000E48IP6:tasty_--and_organic!:nikki_blue_"nikki_blue"	I've been eating gluten-free for 5 or 6 years, and mostly made my own bread, cookies and crackers because GF food was hard to find and about as tasty as cardboard. Thank goodness for Nature's Path; their corn flakes are tasty (but don't make a good coating in recipes that call for "regular" cornflakes, sadly), I love the Panda Puffs and Koala Crisp (yes, I'm a grown-up and I eat these cereals), the kids love the Gorilla Munch, the Organic Crispy Rice Bars with peanut butter are a favorite, and these vanilla animal crackers don't last long in my house... even the non-celiacs love them! I haven't tried the other flavors, but these have a pleasant smell, a crunchy texture like a "real" animal cracker, are not crumbly or gritty, and have a nice cinnamon-y aftertaste. I buy these by the case	1
B000FBM54S:delicious!:s._chi_"cantaloupe912"	These butter waffles are very tasty- very light, yet rich and buttery.  They're hard to resist, couldn't help but eat a whole box.	1
B000BDGA5A:the_best_mixer_ever!!:ken_cohen	I tried this drink with some friends and everybody loved it.  The Meyer Lemon is very distinct and has a great taste. essn Meyer Lemon makes the best lemon drop ever. I would highly recommend essn for your next event or party!!	1
B000F1U9XM:as_good_as_senseo_pods_and_cheaper.:dr._b	Having tried Senseo pods, Millstone, etc.  I was surprised that good old Folgers is just as good and in some cases better than Senseo's newer flavors.  While made for the Home Cafe these fit Senseo coffee makers and give you a good cup for a lot less than the more upscale brands	1
B000H6UX0E:real_coffee_taste:kristin_debacco	This Kenya blend is a mild but very tasteful coffee. No burned taste at all and it has become my favorite	1
B000HZIJQ0:amazing_lollipops!!!!!!!!!!!!:bernstein_"toys_r_my_daughters"	These are the best tasting lollipops you will ever have.  Because of my 2 year olds food allergies I discovered these and now her doctors office is purchasing them, even the hospital my husband works at.  These are allergy free and amazing!!!!!!!!	1
B000EOM5GY:probably_buy_them_again:amanda_peck_"amanda931"	Small, no sugar, a bit harsh tasting (might end up better diluted a bit with club soda).  This is pretty well true of the four I have tried.	1
B000HTJH58:a_good_granola,_for_once:t._rice	This is a good granola. I like that it has lots of seeds with the grainy things, and a few nuts tossed in. Nice taste. Thanks to Amazon for carrying so many gluten free items! Makes like so much easier!!	1
B000E39U68:tasty,_but_dry.:c._l._olsen_"food_pantry_volunteer"	I loved the taste, but the beef was quite dry.  It's very easy to heat up, and probably would be great for a college student as an emergency meal	1
B000HQJPGC:great_bold_coffee!!!:sherrinaz_"sherrinaz"	I had read other's reviews about how great this coffee was, but I was using another coffee that I thought was really wonderful.  I tried this one and now I am hooked.  It is wonderful if you like bold coffee, which I do.  I also like the fact that it is Organic.  I don't drink a lot of coffee each day, but the cup or two I have, I want to be great.  Just wish they had a decaf for my evening coffee	1
B000EYPNCW:yum!:heather_moore_byerley_"castlecat"	I used to love Just Corn but I like this brand even better. I agree they could cut the salt a bit, but I think some salt is a nice compliment to the corn	1
B000E123IM:wow_!_love_at_1st_bite:a_cute_bear_"tnm"	I started to love Annie Chun's udon soup in March 2007. Although it was on my AMAZON GROCERY LIST for many months cause i read a very bad review from a guy that did not know what is great. I just ordered many A. Chun's soup noodle bowls. And i will order more again in future. Annie Chun is a cute and talented woman and she is the 1st Asian female that i admired and read her story about her soup noodle for second time on Amazon.com	1
B000F70OZY:my_son_loves_these:melissa_b_"mom_of_three"	He did not know if he would but he loves them. Great for a quick snack or a snack to go. Please don't quit selling these. Glad we bought them and will buy more	1
B000FD8Z3G:better_than_campbells:jenn_vermeulen_"sweetmama"	Even non-celiac people should switch over. Here's an amazing gravy for chicken or pork chops. Try it next time and serve next to mashed potatoes: 2c. water and 1/2c. mix. Bring to gentle boil over high heat. Remove from heat immediately. Stir in 1/4c sour cream. Pour over meat, browned in a skillet. Simmer on lowest heat until meat is cooked through, turning and stirring often to prevent skorching. Hmmmm. I'm getting hungry	1
B000FIMTOW:very_true_lemonade_taste:j._woods_"jennie's_mary_kay"	Love this stuff.  Great for adding invisible fiber supplements to as well.  No after taste at all	1
B000EMK4VE:bentley's_teas_gift_box:maureen_g._vaughn	After reading that Bentley's has the finest Ceylon teas in the world, I decided to give this as a Christmas gift to my husband.  He says it is the best tea he's ever had, and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur, I would consider that a compliment.  The box is beautiful, and it makes a lovely presentation	1
B000FFIL92:most_elegant_teas:imsocrazy_"frenzied_reader"	Wow, no wonder you can't get this anymore.  They probably can't make them fast enough.  This is such an unusual gift set.  The pot is so cute as well as being a nifty display item.  The teas are all individually packaged and ones that you wouldn't find anywhere else.  Makes you want to drink tea all day.  The box that it comes in (as well as the individual tea box) is reuseable and so pretty.  I hope that this item is offered for sale again soon, as I would buy a dozen of these to keep on hand for gifts...and maybe one for myself!!	1
B000E46GFA:a_staple_in_lunch_box_central:kevin_a._decker_"author,_speaker,_coach,_consultant,_dad,_husband_-_www.kevindecker.com"	When my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday. My wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition, making the right choices, and responsibility.	1
B000CSKK3W:excellent_popcorn:eileen_fitzcharles_"codi_wolf"	It is so good to taste popcorn that tastes as if it were taken right out of a pot of boiling water, buttered and salted to taste.  The smell of corn on the cob runs throughout the house.  Great summer smell all year long	1
B000E1FY4C:golden_nut_crunch_is_the_best:m._brunner	I just bought some of this Golden Nut Crunch from Planter's last week and I snack on it at work... it is really one of the best trail mixes I have had before.  I love it.  It lasts a while also.. it lasted me about 4 days at work just snacking on it periodically.  I would definitely recommend this snack.. It's healthy too	1
B000CQE3JQ:super!:g._burnick	I've tried the Andy Capp HOT FRIES, REG CHEDDAR, and WHITE CHEDDAR. These HOT FRIES are the best. They're the best of the 3 products and best all on their own! I'm getting addicted to them (ordered a second carton before finishing the first). Definitely nicely HOT -- that's part of the addictive quality. And an enjoyable to eat with the good underlying corn flavor and non-greasy crispness that I like about the Andy Capp products	1
B000F6SLMS:great_gluten_free_snack_for_on_the_go:nicole_t._maher_"mom_of_4"	These peanut butter balls not only taste great but they are good for you.  My daughter has celiac disease so foods like these are really blessings in our life.  I have eaten these when I did not have time for lunch.  They are filling and energizing and taste delicious.  You can't ask for more than that!	1
B000EMZ23Y:unusual,_but_great:melloooo	I thought these were amazing.  My favorite is the Socorro blend.  A review said they were soggy, but I'm not sure what they mean.  They are very crisp with nice and chewy fruit.  Despite the fruit, they aren't sweet but the sweet in the fruit really balances out the hotness of the other seasoning.	1
B0007NOWN6:killarney!!_indeed!:terri_mead-white_"sunnyt"	What a deal! Great tasting treat at a good price! I will definetly be ordering other flavors and Killarney again too	1
B000FBP1GW:fast_food_favorite:marcia_bicknell_"marci"	Great nutrition profile for the calories involved. The different textures make for a healthy ORGANIC snack	1
B000FL08B0:the_best_sweetener_out_there:felicia_nellum	By far... the best, no after tastes and will not spike your blood surgar levels, worth every penny	1
B000CS9ZWO:variety:n._riley	This case offers a great variety of favorite cereals for everyone, but this is not for 2 people. The cereal went stale before we could eat it, but this would be great for a large family	1
B000GAO906:nutrition_in_a_yummy_little_package:lily	These might appease your sweet tooth while providing excellent nutrition in a 200 calorie natural food bar. They are not overly chocolately like those chocolate covered protein bars: the bar has delicious chocolate throughout with a terrific crunch of sesame, flax, and sunflower seeds. I'm hypoglycemic and they are perfect to keep in the car for the quick pick up to prevent the need for glucose and a true crisis. I highly recommend. Oh, I have ordered both from Nutiva and from Amazon: Amazon is less expensive and faster delivery	1
B000F70OZ4:totally_surprised_by_great_taste!:joyce_e._stotts_"agapegirl"	My family and my healthfood store lady all say this is one of the best of Betty Lou's Nut Butter Balls.  I do not have any problems at all with the taste, in fact, it beats the heck out of the coconut ones which are extremely sweet.  Yes, they look green in the middle, but we found the taste rather "clean" and refreshing...not overbearing.	1
B000FH2ZIS:delicious:frances_d'amato	THE CEREAL IS DELICIOUS.  I PUT HALF OF A BANANA IN IT.  IT IS FULLING FOR ME. IT IS LOW IN CARBS AND NO SUGAR.  I AM PRE-DIABETIC.  MY SUGAR COUNT IS VERY GOOD WITH THIS.  I WILL NEED THEM AGAIN SOON	1
B000FL1KE4:taste__great!:moonmaidenn_"be_all_you_can_be!"	These are my most favorite of all the Smart Monkey Bars and raw bars in general. The best part is they are not dehydrated so they still have the live water content. Try to stay away from too much dehydrated food. I'm an avid raw foodist. I absolutely love these. I can eat three in a row	1
B000F4H5FE:wow_this_stuff_is_strong..:neal_vanderstelt_"neal"	Tin container not laced in the plasic crap..  The tea is very stonge and not a mixture so you have to add flavors too it but it taste good plain too and is very strong.  Taste wise it's stonge with an inner spice like taste in it if you drink your tea how your supposed to -- not a gulper - chuckle.  It was less than what I thought from the other reviewer but it is so strong you don't need as much and I'd still have to say it's a great deal.  Just add a twist of your favorite herb like orange peal or ginger and this can be the making of a great exotic tea but the only thing it's missing is the organic seal of quality and then it gets 5 stars for proving it's grown under kosher conditions which is very important.  The tins are very nice to look at and I hate to thow them away.  Obviously they put a lot of pride in the product	1
B000GBQS2C:amazing_chicken_broth!:monica_j._henkel	The only better broth I've had was homemade by my hubby! My daughter will even heat it for a quick snack, I love it	1
B000FIMW5S:great_source_of_fiber:jonalex_"mathman"	Granted, this is not one of the better tasting cereals, but when you consider that it will provide the daily recommendation of fiber in just 2/3 cup, the trade-off is worthwhile.  If there is an easier way to get 26 grams of fiber, I haven't found it.  Just be aware that, if you prefer sugary sweet cereals, this definitely is not the one for you	1
B000HZLPRU:tasty_brew:astro_jetson	I've tried 15-20 different k-cups and would rate Timothy's Parisian Night (can you say French Roast) in the top third.  At the 7.25 oz setting it makes a full-bodied, dark brew with a nutty, almost earthy taste.  It's very much a European-style blend, and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese 'brauner.	1
B000E1DSPE:make_it_even_better!:music_lover	My kids love their Macaroni & Cheese but one day all we had was a generic brand.  They didn't eat it all that well (Kraft really is the best) so I decided to try to make it a little better for them.  Follow the recipe on the box with a couple exceptions.  Put one slice of velveeta chees in while melting the butter (I melt the butter while the noodles are draining so as to melt the butter and velveeta faster) and add 1/3 cup milk.  What you'll have is a less expensive version of the really creamy macaroni and cheese that Kraft sells for a lot more money.  By adding extra milk and cheese they're even getting more calcium.  My kids love it when I throw in hot dogs and even peas so feel free to throw in other things since it's so cheesy (the extra cheesy sauce will take things like peas that kids don't normally eat and make them taste good).  Give it a try and see what you and/or your kids think	1
B000E4ALF6:a_truely_great_product!:j._s._burks	This cereal meets three major criteria:	1
B000F4H5FO:my_favorite_tea_-_for_a_reason!:lmacbeth08_"lmac"	I can't say enough good things about this variety and brand of tea.  The bergamot and other citrus elements in the tea and the delicacy of the tannins make milk, sweetener or lemon completely unnecessary.  The color and aroma are just lovely, making this a fantastic treat for the novice or experienced tea drinker, and it has just enough caffeine to get me through tedious afternoons without making me jittery.  I carry the bagged variety everywhere I go	1
B000E671XY:cool_brew_iced_tea:lisa_rivera_"lisa_reviews"	is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries.  We found it necessary to drink with our sweetener.  A refreshing drink, but has a slight after taste to it, maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it (4 qts).  I would have rated a 5, but taste was a little off.	1
B000FBP1GM:wonderful,_filling_cereal!:shopper	I love this cereal. It is the greatest and looks like Amazon offers the best price. I like to add frozen wild blueberries to it with milk. YUM	1
B000EHIVIW:yummy_and_healthy:jojo_elisa_shakerdge	they're a quick fix and they taste incredible. best protein bar around	1
B000E4ALEW:healthy_and_tastes_good.:l._purcell_"homeschoolin_mom"	We love this cereal, it is nice and crunchy and it doesn't leave you hungry for another bowl like the over processed cereals in boxes.  I definately will buy this again.	1
B000E63LAG:cool_brew_blueberry_tea:barbara_l._lutnick_"bonnie"	This is one of the best tasting teas I have used. Keeps well in the refrigerator for two days, retaining its excellent flavor.  I reccommend this tea to everyone, and have shared with many family and friends	1
B00027CE2S:forget_the_politics,_forget_the_earth_--_just_eat!:eddie_kasica	Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)	1
B000EMOD20:rhoda:rhoda	These are a great deal...Cost $2.75 per box they are $3.99 per box at our local grocery store.  They are also very tasty and a healthy snack. Our whole family loves them. I worried about buying a case just seemed like a lot but they are going fast and if you are box top saving people...there is one on every box! So they are good for schools too!	1
B000FIIZ6S:pretty_healthy,_but_not_a_low_sugar_product:c._loiselle_"md/phd"	Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt.	1
B000H2XXKA:fills_you_up_all_morning!:veggiess	These things are great...I love Baker's Breakfast cookies. This flavor is pretty darn good, too, big chunks of chocolate and lots of flavor. Doesn't taste fake at all. I prefer a couple other flavors more, but this is definately a winner. These cookies taste like a treat but are really healthy for you. They will fill you up for hours, especially with a glass of water, juice or milk to wash it down	1
B000FBL8IW:excellent,_excellent,_excellent!!!:jen_babe	My mother absolutely loves this tea, it's the only kind she will use.  I received a container of it in a gift basket, and called bentley to find out where I could purchase more, and they told me they don't sell to the public. My mom was very upset...  I then went on to Amazon (which was great for all my christmas shopping), who put me in touch with bently, so My mother had a wonderful christmas!!!	1
B000GW68Z8:mocha_is_best:anastasia_d._yokosawa	This is a pretty good Splenda flavor, but the Mocha is best, in my opinion.  The French Vanilla is a second favorite.  Hazelnut is better than no flavor at all.  I use one flavored packet and one regular Splenda packet in a large (14 oz) mug, and it's perfect.  Not necessary to use two flavored ones, as it is a little pricey and one has enough flavor for an entire travel mug	1
B000HQJP80:wonderful_taste_and_variety!:a._ebbert	My local Sam's Club discontinued the Nature's Path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales. I was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed Quaker instants - ick! Not to mention I'm tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays. Then I remembered Amazon selling a lot of easily shippable, bulk foods - including organics! :-)	1
B000GW0U8O:good_but_not_the_best:wu_chi_yeh	I tried most of Jack Links' products. I will classified this one as good...but I personally prefer beef nuggets since it tasted juicier.	1
B000F4D4HW:good_product:marilynn_m._slade_"marilynn"	This is a very good value.  I use it to put in many Asian recipes instead of chicken or vegetable broth.  The result is a more authentic Asian taste to my recipes	1
B000CQ6KUG:best_mac-n-cheese_from_a_box_ever!:sandi_k._hubbard_"sandik"	Annie's Homegrown Deluxe Shells & Real Aged Wisconsin Cheddar is the best mac-n-cheese straight out of the box I ever tasted.  Kids and grown-ups agree.	1
B000FGXPNI:these_taste_great!:cocky_balboa	I do not understand the bad reviews of this product. They smelled great, had a nice texture, and tasted like a dried cherry should. They did not clump at all like many dried fruits out there do. They also DID NOT taste like cardboard or were dried like NASA space food like some of the dried fruit out there does.	1
B000J4IDIS:great_tea!:g._d._austin	I bought select items to include with other items in gift bags for Christmas.  The Ahmad selection teas make two excellent cups per bag.  Everyone receiving the tea commented on the fine quality of the product.  Highly Recommended!	1
B000F4F934:a_tea_i_will_never_be_without:kurt_a._johnson	Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. The history of Darjeeling tea goes back to the 1840s, when Dr. Campbell, a civil engineer, planted tea seeds in his garden at Beechwood, Darjeeling. The result was a nice light tea with excellent color and aroma. Darjeeling tea gained a considerable following, and is now highly prized as the "champagne of teas!"	1
B000FH2Z8S:the_oliver_lover's_sauce:t._edick_"tessa"	Adding another Italian classic to our product line, Puttanesca comes from the expression puttanaio which, to put it modestly, translates into "a lot of things going on at the same time".  The rich combination of flavors: garlic, black olives, capers and fresh herbs come from the tradition of southern regional cooking.	1
B000FH15CK:absolutely_fantastic!:selynne	Oh my good god. These are quite possibly *the* most delicious things I have ever eaten.	1
B000FNCTJC:a_relief...:stpehanie_sands_"pokerjoker"	First I'd like to say that many of Nana's cookies are most delicious and I've tried most of the flavors.  My favorites tend to be this one and the chocolate coconut chip.  As one of the other reviewers pointed out you have to have a particular palate to enjoy this type of cookie.  For those of use that try to limit our processed cane sugar intake or have particular dietary restrictions...vegan, sugar substitutes, etc. these are really delicious and allow a taste of that bad for you diet that we've been led to believe we want.  Thanks Nana's for the natural foodie options	1
B000CR1YOM:natural_dog_treats:mary_e._delpapa	Excellent ,Our dogs love them.We have small dogs,so the size is perfect.Little hearts for little dog	1
B000F4D5GC:plenty_aroma_and_flavor_:jan_depre	I use plenty of this product regularly when making ice cream, cookies, cakes etc... I find that this product has a sort of natural sweetness or flavor on its own. Because of this much less added sugar is needed in baked goodies and in some cases added sugar is eliminated. To obtain this, i use this organic unsweetened coconut in combination with organic whole milk.	1
B000F4GPC8:one_drawback:k._wilcox	The taste is OK, but not great.  The one thing about this that is somewhat annoying is that it's a two serving packet which means that it makes 16 ounces for liquid.  I really only want to eat up 8 ounces at a time.  That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion.  Even if I did want to eat the entire packet, I don't have a bowl that is 16 ounces (and all my bowls are perfectly normal sized).  The bottom line here is that there is nothing wrong with the taste of the soup (still, I'm not in love with it).  I just wish there was a better way of packaging.  I'm the only one eating it, and maybe that affects my opinion.  If you have more than one person in your family then it won't be a problem at all, and you can ignore everything I've said.	1
B0009F3SBY:amazing_tea!:b._pumper	I am a no coffee, drink tea ALL the time person.  I have tried so many teas and am constantly interested in trying new ones.  This has to be the most wonderful green tea out there!!  It is wonderful!!!	1
B000G25PYS:very_salty:phlogiston	The product, if reviewed just on taste, would only warrant a two, but the convenience is worth a five.  It is probably the best La Briute product that I have found.  It is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable, but it is way too salty	1
B000GPNKRE:good_for_a_quick_cheap_meal:e.g.	These are a definite time saver with a couple of faults which another reviewer pointed out -- no flavorings in the rice, nori cut too small.  To get around the rice problem, just add a little rice vinegar and sugar to the rice and it comes out quite good.  I don't particularly like wasabi but they should probably add a packet to the box for those who do.  The nori sheets taste good and fresh if maybe slightly salty for my tastes.  As stated before though, they are definitely cut way too small. You cannot achieve any kind of decent looking roll with them, but if you aren't picky about what the finished product looks like and if you pack any added ingredients pretty thin, you can get it to hold together long enough to eat it.  Bottom line is for the ten bucks I paid for 6 packages, I'd say it is a definite winner for 6 cheap fast lunches that taste much better than they look.  I can't eat one sushi roll at a local sushi bar for less than 8 to 10 bucks.  Now that the price for these has gone up a little, I'd probably consider just buying the larger size Annie Chun precooked sticky rice containers (if Amazon gets them back in stock) and providing my own full size nori sheets.	1
B000FIDLJO:a_little_bit_different_type_of_mini_wheat.:detra_fitch	When mini-wheats first came out in the grocery store, I tried them. However, I found they were bland. It was like trying to eat sticks in milk.	1
B000EVG8GU:a_hit!:j._silva_"jojo"	This makes a great cake or cupcakes. I used a modification to make it a chocolate cake & it was a hit, and also baked them in little bear molds -- the kids loved them. I have 3 little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac, and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house. No one non-celiac can tell the difference	1
B000CMFLWI:fantastic!:r._lanthier	Great substitute for high fat potato chips. Good amount of soy protein (6g per serving), excellent flavor, good crunch, and texture. These are actually pretty healthy and a great substitute for someone looking for a low fat diet. No trans or saturated fats. My wife and young daughter, who do not need a low-fat diet as I do, love these. Woohoo	1
B000J2YPP0:better_than_uncle_bens,_with_better_texture:thomas_j._mahowald_"tom_mahowald"	The Southwestern Spanish flavor is pleasant but not overpowering, and the rice is fluffy, not "clumpy" like other brands. I always keep a pouch in my car and at the office for when I don't have time to get out for lunch, and in my suitcase for when I need a late night snack while travelling. We always take Viva La Rice when camping, backpacking or boating. This is an excellent product at a very fair price	1
B000HDK0D2:delicious!:lori_barnard-northrup_"lucky_mommy"	I bought these lollipops for my allergic kids, because these are the only lollipops I have found that don't contain corn.  Not only do my kids love them, but so do my coworkers!  They are delicious - much more flavorful than your usual boring lollipops.  Watermelon is the office favorite so far..	1
B000E46GSW:mcdickson:eric_dickson	These bars are terrific.....very moist unlike many other snack bars.  They are quite tastey and my kids really like them, too	1
B000FF41QY:great_school_snack_for_kids:danisgoat_"danisgoat"	My children love Smart Puffs.  I love the smaller packages for school lunches.	1
B000E4C898:great,_great_jerky!:dr._jerky	This jerky is awesome! Great shape, extremely good taste (kind of sweet for jerky, but very tasty) and very healthy (no nitrites, no MSG, no hormones, etc.). Try it	1
B000J2WVVA:delicious!:luckebreak_"lynn"	Another Viva La Rice Ready to eat product that is delicious with just the right amount of flavor and great texture! I don't know how they do it but it is just right in size to take to work, camping, or to have at home	1
B000E48IMO:wholesome_and_a_great_deal:mary_d._thorpe_"mary14889"	The number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive.  This cereal costs $7.00/bag at my local health food store.   One needs a place to store a case of 26 oz bags, but it's worth it to buy from Amazon.com by the case	1
B000GPY3G6:family_favorite:oakleaf_woman	Unbelievably rich and chocolaty without sugar! No artificial sweetener aftertaste. I like that it's low fat AND high in calcium.  Plus the canister (instead of individual packets) lets you vary the portion to match the size of your mug or your strength preference.  Yummy on a cool day	1
B000F4F94I:great_price_on_the_brand_of_earl_grey_i_prefer...:katherine_vande_brake_"katie"	The opportunity to get Twinings Earl Grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up.	1
B000FK9LFK:good_but_expensive:valueman	Quickly became my favorite when it first came out.  Tastes great and the milk doesn't turn orange like some of the new granola type cereals.  I also use it on ice cream to add crunch.  I would give it 5 stars but even though it think it's great it is overpriced.  Price here is about the same as out local Safeway	1
B0007RAZ5G:great_gluten-fee_rice_crackers:jackie_meade_"gluten-free_girl"	My [...] was addicted to all kinds of cheese crackers. When she had to go gluten-free, we searched for some adequate substitute.  While they are not cheddar goldfish crackers, they are very tasty and satisfying.	1
B000H32T40:good_stuff:angela_braden_"amour_rellement"	Nutty taste, this good for you oil makes great iol based salad dressings	1
B000FBMVZG:fabulous!:jennifer_s._anderson	I first tried this product when I was studying in Philadelphia. I ordered it for an Organic group I lead on campus and the reviews were outstanding. I simply love the product and taste of the hemp seeds. No trace drugs, just natural nutritionally-beneficial components	1
B000EMM9WG:healthy_and_tasty:gene_w._hancock_"citie_mouse01"	I've enjoyed this product for several years, and it was very convenient for me to be able to get it in the mail from Amazon. Thank you	1
B000FGCA2A:great_variety_pack,_all_three_are_good.:wiseguy_945	I love swiss miss cocoa, especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack.  The milk chocolate is great, the Rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate/semi-sweet to darker flavor, and the Marshmallows are just cool. Great for the wintertime. Stock up and enjoy.  Also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee, get the sweetness of Cocoa, and the kick of coffee, got me through a few late nights	1
B000FBO9TC:delicious_small_or_large:bunnybutt	As anyone who has tried Bahlsen Hit cookies knows, they are absolutely yummy, despite the odd packaging and name.  A nice crunchy cookie, not sickeningly sweet, good with cream and sugar tea.  funny thing about the minis though, both sides of the cookie are facing the same direction, so that one of the sides is the "wrong" way, with the printed side towards the cream....just a sidebar--no detraction from how tasty these cookies are.	1
B000EYLK2Y:nice_snack:harper	We enjoyed these, and they are a healthy snack.  They are not low calorie, but very nutritious	1
B000FNROVK:perfect_for_emergencies_._._._like_college:mischa_carlson	First things first, you will not be treated to that classic 'cooking' smell.    In fact, your appetite is better off not catching a whiff of that magnesium-salt concoction that heats your meal.  Think happy thoughts, and be oblivious.	1
B000EMM97Q:clumpy...:l._el-zein_"lmez"	The mix was a little lumpy...had some hard chunks that would NOT dissolve, they were as hard as rocks and some had to be fished out of the batter. The mix was not expired, it was as if it had been exposed to moisture or improper temperatures during storage. Still came out o.k. and tasted great.	1
B000F4F93Y:strong_and_full-flavored:kurt_a._johnson	Twinings was founded in London, England in 1706, and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas. Irish Breakfast tea is a mixture of Ceylon and Assam (black) teas, well-known for its strong, malty taste.	1
B000J4FF9I:one_of_our_favorites!:uhohbaddog	I like a cup of coffee with character, and thus far this Black Gold Extra Bold has delivered.  The "Extra Bold" defines that this K-Cup carries an extra 20-30% of coffee per serving than the standard K-Cup, and as a result this delivers the extra kick that I tend to like.  We only brew at the 7.25oz, and sometimes the 5.25oz volume on our B-70 brewer as we prefer a stronger cup of joe.  This roast is on the dark side, and delivers flavor with intensity, and a nice smoky essence as described.  I also find that this provides a hint of crema, much like a shot of espresso when brewed fresh.  We like it, and if you like stronger coffee, we think you will too!  Try it	1
B000EGX2EG:delicious,_addictive_and_healthy_too!:s._j._davis_"sunshine"	My family and I love Almond Crunch, they're just sweet enough, very crunchy, and a perfect snack	1
B000E4C2PS:excellent_product:munchies_organic	These are tasty, fresh and reasonably priced.   As finger foods, my grandkids love them plain.  A good buy and great for the grandkids (since mom does not know where we get them from and give them them in a plain paper bag.)  Personally I love them rolled in coconut oil and sea salt	1

B000H2W5IQ:uncannily_good:j._hawthorn_"hawk"	Very tasty and healthy product. However I ordered many and discovered expiration dates when I got them. Some had only a couple of weeks which was not sufficient. Wish the date could be a lot longer and at least remind us about expiration dates in the ad	1
B000HQFH9Q:simply_outstanding!!:chef_amy	My family really enjoyed this rice pudding. I loved the real cinammon stick, it gave the rice a rich flavor. The aroma in the kitchen had everyone looking forward to a real treat. Best of all is how simple it was. Boil the water, empty package, wait 20 minutes. Enjoy!	1
B000E130H0:organic_crackers:k._prairie-o'shaughnessy	We really enjoy the crackers, just did not realize that we would not be able to consume 12 boxes between the end of August, 2006 and the expiration date on the product of November 10, 2006. Feel that the 12 boxes would last at least 6 months before expiration when you purchase a case.	1
B000ELYHN6:best_tasting_nuts_i've_ever_had:tatianna_the_reader_"tatianna"	I love these nuts, I stock up on them whenever I can find them in the grocery store, now that Amazon is carrying them I can stock up whenever I go on a nut hunt.  They are sweet and crunchy and so stasifying that I can not go back to the other brand.  Actually I bought the "big" brand of nuts just recently and gave them away after trying a mouthful.  These nuts have spoiled me for any other.  These are GREAT!!	1

B000ESOVAS:it's_addictive_because_it's_delicious:mine_too	I'm a huge white tea fan and regularly keep more than five varieties at any given time.  Clipper's Organic White Tea with Peppermint is easily one of the best of any type of teas.  The flavor is balanced, well defined, and makes for smooth sippin	1
B000E1BLMG:guilt-free_dessert:suepurrsue		1
B000F4EUNE:high_flavor_-_no_corn_syrup:stephen_hollowood	This product is packaged very nicely for keeping. It has good flavor without health-harming corn syrup. Used sparingly, there is very little downside to this product	1
B000E4C2LW:great_product,_great_price.:christine_stewart	Anyone following a gluten-free diet knows how expensive it can be to buy the gluten-free version of anything - and when trying a product for the first time you hope it actually tastes good.  This is one gluten-free product I am completely delighted with - both in taste and price.  These corn flakes are crunchy and delicious (I like them better than the glutenated alternatives), and work well for other recipes.  Candies, cereal crumb pie crusts, fried chicken, etc.	1
B000H3FFFA:italy_loves_lavazza:frances_r._dickman_"duchess_of_westbury"	What can I say about Lavazza that hasn't already been said.  I was in Rome two summer's ago and noticed it is in all the supermarkets. Decaf is usually not so great but this is. They must be doing something right	1
B000CMF196:great_tea:aaron_m._graham	I've tried almost every green tea on the market, and this is one of my favorites.  It has a great flavor, and it really does help me keep from snacking between meals.  I don't think it's possible to find great organic green tea at this price anywhere else	1
B000F6URD4:a_matter_of_taste:p._anderson	I LOVE this coffee. It has a strong flavor and aroma and gets you moving in the morning. I do not believe it is meant to be a fancy gourmet coffee, but rather what I would call Trucker or Cowboy coffee.	1
B000FGXPJW:stoneridge_orchards_bodacious_blueberries:reel_catch_"red"	Bigger and more luscious than any other available dried blueberries.  They make a huge difference and are worth the extra price.  I substitute them for the raisins in our favorite Quaker Oatmeal cookie recipe and everyone loves the results.  Hope the oatmeal and blueberry health benefits cancel the butter/sugar calories!	1
B000F4J73C:single_malt_and_cigars.:themis-athena	Lapsang Souchong tea comes from the mist-enshrouded Wuyi Mountains in the northwestern corner of China's Fujian Province (north of Guangdong [Canton] Province), whose greatest tourist draw besides its mountains is its coast line on the Taiwan Straits.	1
B0009F3SAK:i_love_this_tea!:glofrazier	I absolutely love the taste of this tea and so does everyone else I've encouraged to try some (even my coffee drinking daughter).  I drink a lot of herbal teas and this is definitely my favorite.  I can't tell if it's really detoxifying my liver and kidneys, but I do know that drinking a cup boosts my energy level and make me feel better.	1
B000FPHGWU:love_it!:j	This mix is a blessing for those w/ food allergies!  Even if we didn't have any food allergies, I'd buy this mix.  I do have to cook it a bit longer than the box states and a lot longer(10m) if using a glass dish	1
B000EHZZQ8:tasty_bread:j._baity	My husband, who has celiac disease, thinks this is the best bread on the market.  It definitely is the easier to make.  Only requires oil and water, and turns out perfect every time.  Amazon's price beats those health food stores by a long shot!  Try it	1

B0007LXU8Q:so_good_i'll_actually_spend_a_minute_to_give_it_5_stars.:tamara_mady	I've never reviewed a food item before, but this delectable little bar was so heavenly I had to change my mind. At the time, it was a mere snack in between classes; afterwards, it earned a place in my heart, as well as my eternal devotion.	1
B000FIDLOE:flaky_can_be_good:neal_j._pollock	I like the basic Special K flakes made from rice & wheat (though I really shouldn't eat gluten).  Mostly I use cereal to snack on vs. with milk (boo lactose!).  Special K tends to have more nutritional value than most cereals which I like too.  But, I wasn't enamored with either the fruit or the yogurt parts of this particular cereal.  Frankly, I think it would taste better without them or with something else.  The yogurt pieces didn't seem to merge well with the cereal IMHO.  But then, that's why there's chocolate & vanilla	1

B000H7VG8G:baking_with_splenda_:lisa_rivera_"lisa_reviews"	I was eager to try the Sugar Blend for Baking.  I noticed a difference in the consistency of the cake batter and it did not rise as high and seemed to be more compact. The usage guide was helpful and included a recipe on the package. The flavor was comparable to regular sugar and those with diabetes are now able to enjoy some of the sweeter things in life.	1
B000EUF5BK:bear_cookies:rebecca_nolde-hurlbert_"becca"	Excellent cookies-my boys love them & know they are a treat that is on the healthy side. We will buy these again.	1
B000GRCUJQ:great_organic_cookie!:healthy_mom_"healthy_mom"	I love these cookies! The only complaint I had is that I ordered a case (12 boxes) and the expiration date was 4 weeks from the day I received the shipment. Yikes, I still have over half the case left and I've been eating them daily (and giving them away)! I probably will not purchase again from this vendor for this reason alone. However, if you're looking for a great, organic cookie without trans fats, this is a nice healthy option	1
B000FMZO8G:great_for_toddlers,_too!:new_mom	Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt). My 2-year old has been eating these for a year now, and is constantly asking for his "Peapods?" A portable snack, far superior nutritionally to the typical cookie, cracker, goldfish, pretzel and other processed junk most kids are eating. These are just dehydrated snap peas, corn oil and salt (and there's still LESS sodium in these than Pepperidge Farm's low-sodium goldfish!). A great alternative to the usual snack highly processed of white flour, sugar, salt and/or chemical preservatives. They're better for you, and they taste great. We love them	1
B000FIIXFQ:my_husband_loves_this_coffee.:priscilla_h.	That's all that matters to me. I can't always find it in stock at the local store, and I want my husband to be able to enjoy it.	1
B000I6JPQQ:my_husband_can't_tell_the_difference!:b._b._"my5punkins"	I think Splenda is great, but I grew up with artificial sweeteners and a true test to how great this product is, is to let a sugar addict try it.  My husband happens to be one, and he cannot tell the difference between Splenda and sugar in his tea! As with other artificial sweeteners, you get an unpleasant after taste--with the Splenda there is none! You can use this to cook with too! It's a wonderful low fat alternative to sugar.	1
B000CQE3JG:the_best:a._b._herbertz	Pemmican "Premium" and "Long Lasting" Peppered flavor is the Best I have ever had by far - and I am a certified "jerky freak". They are not stringy or rubbery, simply easy to eat and absolutely delicious	1
B000CR41JW:forget_the_politics,_forget_the_earth_--_just_eat!:eddie_kasica	Green is good, of course. But what's much better than green are these truly awesome cookies. PN Os beat the bootie out of any Oreo variation -- crunchier, more filling(without being smarmy), much better taste. (And this goes for the mint, the vanilla, and the chocolate.)	1
B000H7XXVY:these_cherries_are_great.:jennifer_p	I was very pleased with these dried cherries.  They are delicious -- not too sweet, not too tart.  Healthy, too	1
B000FH2ZI8:this_is_much_better_than_the_stuff_in_my_grocery_store:mmb	This is great instant oatmeal, I eat it almost every morning. I used to buy the Quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but I will continue to buy this. It is very convenient to order this in quantity even though I'm the only one in my household eating it, since I go through it pretty quickly	1
B000CSEINK:being_evil_is_fun...:k._strong	Delightful popcorn mix which is great for snacks and is a really nice treat for lunches.  Very tasty and hits the spot for those sweet tooth cravings without being too far off the old diet.  Buying it here is a bargain, too	1
B000EDM88A:best_cranberries_on_the_market:chinadoll	I've tried several different cranberries and these are by far the best on the market.  I received these today and had another brand available to taste test/compare.  The ingredients listed on each package were the same but Bob's has fewer calories and a much sweeter taste.  The berries do cost a little more but they are worth every penny.	1
B000E4ALH4:yummy_granola_bars!:working_mom	I usually hates granola bars.  They tend to be too sweet and I am not crazy about the texture.  My 3-year-old son's daycare requires all new kids to pack an earthquake emergency kit (yet, we live in California) and one of the required items is 10 granola bars.  I bought this just to prepare the kit, hoping that he would never have to eat them.  Since the product comes with 30 bars, I took some to the office as my emergency stash.  They are actually quite tasty.  My son also likes them as a quick afternoon snack while we are out and about.  Never thought we would actually consume them when I bought this but it looks like we will reorder soon.  And it's organic	1
B000EQT5YM:the_popcorn's_a_hit!:djm_"deb"	Both adults and kids alike very much enjoyed this popcorn. Nice cheddar flavor without any yellow hands	1

47670	I had bought this razor after reading some of the reviews. I used the razor as directed in the instruction manual. The manual said when you first use the razor your beard would get used to it after a few weeks of use. I used the razor for a few weeks and with ever week the bumps got worse. I had to stop using it entirely for my skin to heal. Do not buy this product	0

116015	LCD fell off when arrived because the two-side sticker wasn't stong enough. Anyhow,I could push it back. Then, the scale couldn't be turned on by tapping on the top. This is the only way you can make this scale work as discribed on manual. I have to remove and insert battery to turn it on everytime! I think some force sensor attached to the frame is broken. This is the problem I can't fix.  The only thing I can do is sending it back.	0
139710	I own a more expensive Braun but bought this model as a gift for someone who I wasn't sure if he would use an electic toothbrush. After 7 months, the toothbrush won't turn off-something is shorted out. Unfortunately I no longer have the receipt. My more expensive model which I use multiple times a day has been problem free for over five years	0

205689	Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.	0
254446	I used this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades. I have always cut myself occasionally, but when I cut myself with the Fusion Power, I got this huge cut under my chin that eventually left a scar! Talk about sharp! I went back to using it and then a month or so later I cut myself AGAIN and this one was even worse. You could almost see five lines of blood on the point of my chin. I tossed the Fusion in the garbage, went back to the 3-blade, and wrote Gillette an e-mail to complain, to which they did not respond.	0
283495	Picked this up to try out because of the ratings & price. Didn't do a thing for me.  Wipe it on, let it haze and wipe it off.  No difference.	0

335717	The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying.	0
367162	I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.	0
398314	I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me.	0

472919	When I got this pedometer, I found that the instructions weren't clear.  I never did get the thing to work.  I have had pedometers before and they have always been easy to operate.  This one wasn't.  The pedometer doesn't cost enough to go through the hassle of returning it at your cost.  It's just easier to buy a new one.  However, I suggest that you purchase it in person from a sporting goods or health store	0
500189	I finally got this toothbrush after I have seen alot of people use them.  I am very disappointed.  The design of the brush and the charger seems really outdated and bulky.  It's constantly getting dirty with dust and tooth paste.  It's very hard to clean.  It's loud, and small brush.  Not to mention the replacements for the brush are too expensive.  No thank you	0
531908	The first shave seemed good; but the second time did me in with the Fusion. Instead of just one nick, I managed around 3 or 4 nicks at once. But looking at the cost of the replacement cartridges put me into a state of price shock.	0
553011	I took Passion RX because I am 31 years old and have a very low sex drive and no passion. I had great success the first week I took this product. In fact I was so pleased, I bought 2 more bottles. However, the second week, I went back to having no sex drive. And even though I am continuing to take Passion RX, it has not had any effect whatsoever since the first week.  I take 2 pills each day in the morning, and have done so for over a month.  I suppose everyone is different but I won't purchase any more. Plus I just saw a webpage from Consumer Health Digest that gives it low rating compared to other products: http://consumerhealthdigest.com/top25female.htm?source=overute/Passionrx&OVRAW=passion%20rx&OVKEY=passion%20rx&OVMTC=standar	0

603330	I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short.	0
B0009WRJLC:not_worth_the_nice_look:sarah	I paid $45 for this aesthetically pleasing scale.  Sure it looks nice, but if it doesn't do its job, it's not much of an accessory for the bathroom.	0

B00068HAK4:clipper_that_pulls_hair:kristie_lowery	I bought this to save money and time on trips to the barber every two weeks for my son's fast growing hair.  He's got thick hair that we like to keep "buzzed" short.  The first time I used the clippers, he complained that they really pull at the hair.  I realized they were jamming up with each strip of hair I buzzed.  The little trimmer that is included never jammed but still pulled at his hair.  I've decided to send it back.  Reasonably priced but not worth the pain.  NOT RECOMENDED FOR THICK HAIR	0
B00004D3EJ:buy_separately:s._glickler_"sorcha_griannon"	Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock.  I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width.  That said, throw everything else out.  The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier.  The spoon...not even going there.  The med dropper isn't easy enough to use.  My suggestion?  Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening.  To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe.  This is the best way to do it.	0
B000BONONK:save_your_money:j._young_"you_know_it"	Just received two of these. Yes, how dumb of me to buy two not knowing much about it.  The quality of the casing is really poor.  The plastic is very flimsy feeling.  The labels were all half-way peeled off upon opening the box. They show signs of just simply being really old.	0
B00005MOU9:disappointment:t._ashleman	Does not measure up to the Shihatsu 110 AC messager, which actually works. This unit has multiple vibrating buzzers. I could not feel the heat. The motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids' giant bass speakers	0
B00005CDSF:don't_bother:me_and_my_baby	I also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months.  I REALLY loved this machine though!  It actually blew air!  And it has the nice SAFE switches unlike the toggles that most have now.  I had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while I was gone and almost burned the place down.  So anyway, I'm trying to contact the manufacturer, but I doubt it will do any good.  Too bad.  Loved it while it worked.  Hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before I saw the reviews	0
B0009V1YQE:do_not_buy:r._bill_"honestreviewer"	This product is not even directionally accurate.  It said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual.  Then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat.  Perhaps we had a lemon, but I am taking this back because it is very inaccurate.  In fact, this is the first review I have ever written because I want to warn people about this product.  Please do not waste your money	0
B000BUUVTO:a_big_step_backwards..._don't_be_fooled.:joe_sixpack_--__slipcue.com	I began using Gillette's Mach 3 razor when it first came on the market, and was very happy with it (until recently...) The original Mach 3 would give consistently good, smooth shaves, and worked well for about six or seven times until it dulled and began to give rough shaves. That was an excellent product. However, with the introduction of the new Fusion razor, the Mach 3 suddenly became much less effective and the shaves I was getting were much rougher.	0
B000E66RQQ:effective_coffee_stain_spreader:l._t._harley	This morning I spilled coffee on my "million dollar" white dress shirt.  It left me with three large coffer stains.  I remembered that I had my Tide To Go in the car.  After drenching the stains with the solution and rubbing them per the directions, most of the coffee stains had disappeared....what remained, however, were large coffee colored rings at the edges of where the solution had spread.  So, most of the coffee stain was gone, but I'm left with the unsightly rings...not quite as noticeable, but there're still there.	0
B000A3I4JQ:according_to_this_device,_i'm_dead.:portypal	As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79.  In the afternoon it was 188 over 155.  Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death.  At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78.  It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock.  I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon	0
B0000E2PEP:don't_buy_it!!:allysa_smith_"ally"	I bought this straightener TWO times..the first time i had it for about 8 months. My friend had bought the straightener and I fell in love, so I bought my own. The first 8 months were heaven. I straightened my hair all the time. Then, at 8 months, one of the plates stopped working! For a while i used it, but it took forever, and didn't straighten my hair well at all. I decided to buy another, thinking that it was just a defect on the first. I bought the other and it didn't work nearly as well as I had remembered! In fact, it stopped heating up all together within 3 months!! Another friend of mine bought this same straightener and it caused problems for her as well. We have both decided against buying this one again, obviously, and I would reccommend you do, too. I have heard that the newest Conair straightener is wonderful, and comes with a two-year warranty, so I wouldn't have to pay again, if it did the same thing to me that this one did. DON'T BUY IT! unless, of course, you enjoy being ripped-off..	0

B000H72COI:less_than_impressed:b._orlitzky	I found this product after seeing it lauded on The Today Show and it appeared to be a GREAT idea.  However, I had a lot of difficulty getting the back and strap porting of the bra into the BraBABY and they were pretty tangled when I later took the bras out.  I also have to wonder how a larger bra would work, considering I'm merely a B cup and it was a tight fit.  In theory, I think it's an excellent idea.  In truth, I think it still needs work.  Additionally, although the advertisement claims that you can put them in the dryer, one out of two of mine opened in the dryer both times I've used them - even drying on gentle cycle.  It did maintain the shape of the cup and the underwire throughout the wash spin cycle - a plus.  I hope they keep working on the strap and ease of insertion issue	0
B000H72COI:broke_on_first_wash:alc	I saw that there were mixed reviews for this product before I bought it, but I decided to take a chance on it anyway. Unfortunately, both balls broke their first time through the wash. My bras fell out and got squished and creased. Don't buy this!!	0

B000ITM8J4:sorry_about_that:donald_r._boyd	It was a nice looking razor but it didn't work and I had to send it back for credit. I bought another one locally and had trouble with it also.

B000AQI1WS:barely_worth_the_effort.:michael_a._brown_"maniacmedia"	Two main problems with this "cordless massager". The first being that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. You may get an hour use on a full charge, and that shows diminishing power as it goes. Add to that it's general lack of any real massaging capability and you have one very poor piece of equipment. If you're looking for something to rumble a slight bit, this is for you. Otherwise, save your money	0
B000AP6U2C:body_bare_pubic_shaver_triple_combo_pubic_hair_and_bikini_line_trimmer_review:snow_"snow"	Got the BodyBare and the Ladyfair combo.  The Ladyfair is cheap and poorly made. It pulls as much hair as it cuts, plus it cuts the skin.The BodyBare does nothing at all.  It's so weak and delicate that it won't cut anything.  Don't waste your money..	0
B0001HYLQQ:use_lotion_instead:j._boeckmann	The razor I bought came with packets of this gel, as well as the lotion.  Possibly due to the consistency, the gel gets used up more quickly. It is also not as comfortable to use as the lotion is.	0
B000FL5130:i_wish_the_numbers_were_right...:crafty_fox	I bought this scale to replace my previous scale with body fat option.  It was not easy to use, as you HAVE TO put in your information unless you want to use kilograms, and you still have to enter your height in meters.  All that aside, it continues to tell me that my body fat is between 14 and 15%.  Am I an athlete?  No.  Am I female? Yes.  Is 14% body fat possible???  Well let's just say it is HIGHLY unlikely.  I can't comment on the water numbers it gives me because I don't really have anything to go on there, but even at my fittest I was over 20% body fat, and that was a while ago..	0
B0000DBNER:not_impressed:brosia	I was just given this set- new- and was impressed by the reviews. I'm not sure if it's just my hair, but these do little more than a roller hair brush and dryer. I figured I needed to work out the kinks and give it another try. Again same look and that's all the curl I have after 20 minutes. Concept is good- just doesn't work on my fine, full head of hair. If you want curl stick to the hot rollers.	0
B00022WC1Q:worst_clippers_i've_ever_owned:d._nolan	I've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far the worst pair of clippers i have ever owned.  I have short hair and cut my hair myself twice a week.  The length adjuster on the side of the clippers doesn't hold.  If the clippers are positioned all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down.  Tightening the screw didn't help either.  The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.  This attachment can only be used if you don't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull.  The only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless but whats the point if the clippers suck	0
B000B69R2K:erroneous_readings:b._narbuth_"nurse"	After doing extensive research on the web, I purchased this item to replace a current blood pressure monitor. While the Easy Fit cuff was easy to place, the B/P readings obtained for my wife and myself were much higher than those obtained on our previous B/P cuff as well as higher than blood pressures taken at the doctor's office.  Since we had no confidence in the accuracy of the readings, I returned the B/P cuff to Amazon for a refund.	0
B0002KHJ1G:comfy_chair,_weak_"massage":r._nasatir	This is a sad invention. Instead of massaging, it vibrates and in no way "relieves stress".  Besides this, it's very low budget:  first off, the label for a "thigh massage", actually vibrates at you calves (on the ottoman).  Where it is labeled "lumbar", it actually massages your thighs.  When you try the pre-designed massages ("modes"), the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots.  The whole thing is almost musical. Whoever designed this chair should try a different profession. Besides all this, the chair itself is fairly comfortable, and the heat is nice, although a little weak	0
B0002740H0:not_worth_it:e._benefiel_"liz"	Don't be fooled by the similar-sounding, inarticulate reviews--this product is not what you think it is. It contains neither motor nor electrical stimulation.

B0000C88FJ:enough_of_the_sore_neck:robert_bingham	I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does.	0

B0000E3J9F:faulty_product:m._ashby	I had the exact same experience as Stan, another reviewer. I bought this heating pad and when it turned itself off, I could not get it started again. Like Stan, I thought it was a fluke and bought another. Same problem, two days after buying the pad. I have looked in four stores in the Seattle area and cannot find another brand of heating pad. This one should not be on the market. I am sending both pads back to the manufacturer	0
B0006J31X8:good_idea,_but_does_not_work_well_in_practice:stacey_guth	I first bought the standard, and then the large size in an attempt to have a pair that fit well. I used them riding a bike in the winter months. Neither pair fit well and there are most likely very few people who will obtain a good fit. For the goggles to be snug enough to prevent wind from entering (and prevent tearing) causes great pressure above the ear. The rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely. I retired my Clics when I found foam padded sunglasses for motorcyclists.	0
B000GPQV3Y:great_while_it_worked:melissa_c._gabriel_"humanitarian"	I really enjoyed my Nano CHI iron while it lasted (RIP 7/06-11/06), it handles well, it's a great straightener, and it's a pretty color. However, I dropped it approximately two feet, onto a carpeted floor, and it stopped working. I purchased the CHI about four months ago and think that a $120 iron should be a bit more resiliant. I'll still purchase CHI products, but wouldn't recommend investing in the Nano Technology just yet...there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, and it's not worth having to pay an extra $35 to have it repaired	0

Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money	0

B0009DT388:power-less:orza_ainka_"orza"	The design is great, very light, easy to handle.  It's very nice to be able to use it cordless.

B000FJUA8S:it_has_good_support_but_the_materials_were_very_annoying.:tlb	I recently purchased the Obus Forme Lowback Backrest, along with the Seat Cushion. Although I have heard people rave about the excellent support, and they felt comfortable enough to me, I can't give them more than 2 stars. The material used in their construction drove me to distraction. This is obviously a personal preference type of thing. Other folks may have no issues with the material at all. These are just my feelings on the matter:	0
B0008ENT9C:died_after_one_use...:cecilia_sullivan_"surrogate_mother_cat_and_vet_tech_instructor"	...and it wasn't worth having to send it back.  Seriously.  I thought maybe it was the batteries, so I switched them.  No luck. It ran very, very slow, and then it just quit.  As another reviewer smelled burnt plastic when the unit was in use, it's my guess that something melted/warped in the mechanism.  I will give the manufacturer a bit of credit since this item did perform nicely the one time I was able to use it, so I'll call it a 10 dollar pedicure and call it a wash.  I have a makeup mirror from the same manufacturer and am really happy with it, so I know all their merchandise isn't shoddy.  Maybe I got a dud, considering many others' positive reviews.  I sure hope so	0

B00000JHQ7:a_disappointment,_to_say_the_least.:nate_dogg_(lucainegan@erols.com)	I expected so much and yet recieved so little from these so called &quot;batteries.&quot;  Number one, I was disappointed to find out, after some scientific analyses I performed on them, that duracell's world famous  &quot;copper top&quot; statement is erroneous. This so called &quot;copper  top&quot; is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called  copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly.     After the  analyses, I put these &quot;copper top&quot; batteries to the test.  What I  did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like  sheen.  What I got was far from.  A tiny light that could only be  classified as much less than miniscule.  I threw the flashlight at my cat  in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed!  This  was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've  ever made.  Thanks for nothing, dura-hell	0

B00005B6ZR:do_not_buy_this!!:	I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn't even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!	0
B0000AR6XD:defective_product:william_m._knapp	I liked this heating pad so much when I first used it that I immediately ordered a second one (for what I expected would be a year or two in the future). What I liked was that the wiring was indeed much thinner than other pads, allowing it to conform to the shape of my body. However, the first pad lasted only two weeks before failing to heat. I returned it to HomeMedics and they ignored me. The second one lasted nearly a month before it to failed to heat. I will not bother wasting the postage to return this one, as obviously HomeMedics does not care about quality nor customer satisfaction. I recommend that you not waste your money on this defective product	0
B0002RQ0UK:damaged_goods:andrea_hulburt	The plastic on the foot massager was cracked down the center with a thin crack branching off to the right spinner. I was not in the same state when the package arrived so I was not able to open it for over a month...my loss. I don't know if it was not structurally sound, or if the box was just not handled properly.  Either way, I've got a dud	0
B00009RB0X:disappointing:s._brasher	Just used this razor for the first time.  Could not get a close shave out of it at all.  The trimmer will cut hair but not stubble.  On top of all of this it gave me a pretty bad gash.  I'm very disappointed in this razor but I guess I got what I paid for.  I'm going to order a new razor right now because I can't stand to shave with this one any longer than necessary	0
B000FZ4TFC:"high_performance_motor",_my_foot!!:ralph_harris	I really wanted to like this product after reading all their hype about how quick and easy it is. Not. The motor in it heats up quickly and the thing stops working. You wait about 20 minutes for it to cool down and it will start up again. But by the time you are  getting results in one area of your foot, the thing heats up and stops working again. I went through four intervals of effective operation, heat build-up causing it to quit, waiting a long time for it cool off before starting up again. Finally I decided it isn't worth the time and aggravation, even though it produced good results during the intermittent periods when it worked. One more thing -- when I gave up and decided to return it, I took my Duracell batteries out and they were blazingly hot. I worry that it might be possible for the batteries to explode from the hot-running motor. I've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this.	0
B000FGC41M:not_hot_enough:c._comeaux	I bought this one because it had 4 settings instead of three - So I thought one of them might actually be hot.  Instead, the highest setting is warm to the touch - not hot.  This may be a "lawsuit friendly" reality with heating pads today - I've yet to find one as good as my old one that died 2 years ago (I had that one for 10+ years, the Sunbeam replacement I bought prior to this one lasted 2 and wasn't hot).	0
B00064NFGG:do_not_buy_it!:n._zhang	It looks cool and I ordered one. It turns out a bad choice. The product is totally ineffective. Do not buy this unless you want to end up returning it like me	0
B00006IEC7:where_was_it_made?:d._s._bornus	Before you buy, be sure to check where the pen was made. I have a number of older Cross pens that say "USA" near the top, and they are great pens. However, I have bought three different ones in the past few years that do not indicate where they were made, and they are of inferior quality. The top and bottom halves are loose, and have to be carefully manipulated to come together without a gap. The first one I got, I sent it back to Cross for warranty repair under their "lifetime guarantee," only to receive it back unchanged telling me that it was just fine - and a "handling fee" attached.	0
B00075M1XW:shouldn't_a_heating_pad_heat_up?:labgeek	This pad barely got warm. It's going back! Since this is the same complaint as with another Sunbeam model I tried, I suspect it isn't defective but intentional... probably for legal reasons. But shouldn't a heating pad actually have some heat to it??	0
B000GP5752:dead_on_arrival:mike_c.	Looked like a good product with a good price. Unit failed to turn on or ever  take a charge despite plugging in properly and trying to charge overnight as suggested in the instructions.

B000BUUVTE:unimpressed_with_this_product:anthony_harika_"hareek"	I got the Fusion razor in the mail a few weeks ago so I decided to give it a try.  At first it seemed ok, but I started noticing that it pulled at the hair on my face more than my Mach 3 turbo.  I decided to experiment and shave half of my face with a Mach 3 Turbo and the other half with the Fusion.  From my experience, the Mach 3 Turbo gave a closer shave, and glided much smoother across my skin than the Fusion.  I think the 5 blades on the Fusion are more of a gimmick than anything else.  And as cool as the single trimming blade is, it seems like Gillette had to include this because of the poor accuracy of having 5 blades.  In other words, the single blade is a fix rather than a feature.  My call is if your using a Mach 3 Turbo, don't waste your money on the Fusion	0
B00005B6ZS:i_hate_the_clips_:kimberly_eversole_"consumer_of_fine_products"	My rollers are constantly popping out of the clip holders from this set, regardless of me using more or less hair. Maybe there is a magical perfect portion of hair to roller ratio. If so it is impossible to find. I dunno, but I do know I would NOT recommend these. Also even when I get these to stay in my hair, my hair doesn't curl nearly as much as it usually does in hot rollers. Overall buy something else	0
B000ALCJRQ:could've_been_great:n._kinney	However, after using for 10 minutes it automatically shuts off and would not come back on. Straightened and dried my hair beautiful but spend the extra money at Sephora because everyone is getting bad irons from Amazon. It is really sad that no one can get one that is worth what you pay. So if you have had good luck with one so far, be glad because I paid for the 2 day shipping couldn't wait, and have GREAT disappointment because now I have to return it!	0

B0007KPC60:pull_ups_for_lazy_parents:zooie_"homeschooling_mom"	Pull ups are NOT very good for potty training, they are for parents who are too lazy to take their kids to the bathroom.  Potty training does not include using diapers.  That is what these are is fancy diapers.  If you want to potty train your kids put them in real underwear or training pants with a plastic cover on them.  The wetness liner is a joke.  These also give kids the impression that if they do not want to go to the bathroom they can just go in their pants	0
B00000J47O:not_for_single_charge,_long_term_use...:	I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.

B0009AFWJA:same_amount_of_work_:j._white_"janinenc"	I have three bathrooms used by two teenagers and their friends, a toddler and her friends and so they need heavy duty cleaning every week. A neighbour suggested the Mr Clean to me saying it really cut down on her cleaning time and she didn't have to wreck her back scrubbing the tub.  I am disappointed with it. The one thing I did like was the pole. I was able to scrub the tub, the tile on the walls without needing to overreach. That said, I really had to scrub hard to get the grime off the tub, and still couldn't get it all until I used my regular scrub brush. I think I was expecting this to be a way that I could do a lighter clean in between the heavy duty ones but obviously not so. The other thing that bothered me was that you have to RINSE off the stuff after you scrub; from watching the commercial I feel misled because you get the impression that you just scrub and you're done. At least it wasn't that spendy so I don't feel too bad about the wasted money	0

B00005A44K:marginal,_though_not_horrible:nietzsche_"alg"	The reviewer who compared the massage feature to that of a cell phone perhaps said it best, so suffice it to say that one can essentially ignore that aspect of the unit [I might even liken the vibrations to those of an injured (and no longer airborne) housefly buzzing in circles].

B0009MFUVS:uplift_upeasy_cushion_-_waste_of_money:marjorie	This item is totally uncomfortable to sit on and makes your back ache horribly.  Also it does not work well at all.  If you have difficulty rising from a seated positon this item will not help in the least. Many times it stays flat and when it does "rise" it only occurs after you push up yourself with your arms and legs. I would have returned the item, but I left it for my mother when I had to be out of town for a few weeks and by the time I returned my 30 day window was closed.  DO NOT BUY, you will regret it if you do. I won't even put this item in a yard sale, because I would not subject anyone to false hope and a back ache to go along with it.	0
B000FGI254:looks_nice,_doesn't_work:lester_piggott-smith	We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.	0

There is no massaging action - YOU DO ALL THE WORK, making your hips and knees sore. The "massaging foot beds" are totally motionless and form a spiky, painful surface. Vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device. Jets are totally underpowered. No fill line indicator so "Bubbles" spill water onto floor. Heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different. Cannot return because water ruins loofa and epsom salt pads. Classic deception in advertising	0
B0000D1BOC:maybe_i_bought_a_'sample':jj_schwartz	I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  &quot;What the heck,&quot; I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars	0

B0001HYMFQ:and_the_plastic_keeps_on_coming:shay_lynn_"shay_in_colorado"	When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded.  Let me see:  a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world's landfills every year.  I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I'd like to admit.  This is totally over the top.   When I've used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes.  It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  So don't anyone else make my mistake	0

B00005A443:light_bulb_burns_out_quickly:julestim_"julestim"	I purchased this because it was so cute, and had the Conair name.  Within 6 weeks, the bulb blew out, and I started looking for a replacement.  Ive been to all the local places, and everyplace I could find online.  In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.  The only place I could get the correct bulb was on the conair website -- but they make you buy 10 bulbs, then charge $9.00 for handling.  The cost is more than just buying a new mirror!  a rip off	0

B000FKHMGU:these_are_the_best_bags_out_there,_but_they_still_aren't_good_enough:asha_williams	I chose these bags partly because of the reviews that I read on this website and because they made economic sense.  I gave birth to a premature infant who was unable to breastfeed.  I have pumped everyday btwn 6-8 times a day since she was born and was blessed to have an ample milk supply.  However, when thawing these bags out I found that I was losing sometimes 4 and 5 bags of at a time due to leakage not from the double seal at the top, but from a seam at the bottom.  I later tried some of the other bags out there and found that yes, these bags are better than their competitors, but they were not good enough for me. I have worked way too hard to provide my child with nourishment only to have it leak all over the place.  My solution was to use bottles.  They too have disadvantages (take up more room in the freezer), but I feel that they are a better choice	0
B00067JKH6:junk:rabach_"quality_shopper"	Perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality.  My experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all.

B000136P82:motor_is_a_dud:nyclatinyabo95_"lefty"	While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality.	0

B0000X63LM:difficult_and_inaccurate:tracy	I bought one last year as it was supposed to be accurate and you could do it yourself.  Doing it yourself is misleading as the directions for one of measuring sites for women require you to hold it in your right hand and measure the back of your right tricep.  Impossible to do both at the same time.  Even with the help of my trainer who is skilled at using calipers it gave widely variable readings and inconsistant results.  The feature that takes your % body fat and classifies your level by age never worked.  Mine was stuck making the classification by the youngest age group for women.  Basically it ignored specific data entered in for age and male/female.   I was very disappointed but was fortunate to get my money back	0

After 7 days of use, the pad stopped working a third time, but this time Kaz VOIDED the warranty! Then, they said I should get an electric blanket if I wanted to keep warm.

B00075LUKM:not_"aluminum":dwight_a._moody	I ordered the Ergo Lounger.  When I arrived, I was shocked to find that I could barely lift the box that it came in. I wanted to move it to another room to unpack.  This was supposed to be lightweight "aluminum" but the box clearly said "steel."  I did NOT want one that would rust because I intended to carry it to the beach to use it.  I actually called the Manufacturer (they provided a toll free number) several times.  Never did they answer the phone, nor did they ever return any of my calls.  So I could not find out if they thought it was aluminum or not.  The lounger itself seemed pretty nice, just too heavy and probably would rust soon	0
B0009STNQA:poorly_designed:s._kirk	While one would think it would be impossible to foul up such a simple and common tool, the manufacture has indeed done so. The "spoon" portion of this shoe horn is attached to a heavy coil. I supposed this is intended to give the working end some flexibility, but instead of using a fastener or weld, its just rolled metal inserted into the coil. After only two uses the "spoon" came out of the coil and even though I could easily enough put it back together, after a couple of more uses it became so loose it would not stay. Basically its now a shoe horn minus the twenty something inch handle now. Would recommend buying a more simply designed, single piece shoe horn.	0

B000KK02X0:bad_product_-_stay_away:fat_man_"gary"	I purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models, since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat.  The scale part works normal, but the Body Fat measurement is higher by 20 - 30%, compared to Tanita BC554 scale or Omron HBF-306C hand held.  Omron, replaced the unit, but the new one is also inaccurate.  Now, I'm tying to get my money refunded, but Omron does not want to take the unit back	0
B000F97B6M:nice_wake-up,_crummy_lamp:l._b._elston_"alphamare"	Waking up to this product's sound and light is delightful.  Trying to read, at night, by the "daylight" bulb is not delightful.  The light is too dim.  I've done the things suggested by instructions and other users, to no success.  I must agree that, for the price, this product should have better sound and quality.

B00008V407:subpar_at_best:v._lea	This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.  And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product.	0

B000BTHJCM:not_happy:m._tillson	I ordered this product on June 7th 2006, today is July 11th 2006, and I still have not received it.  I have cancelled my order because it is a lot faster to drive to the story to purchase it, than to wait over a month for it to show up.  I'm really not happy with the turn around time for the Tide HE Detergent.	0
B00022WA5Y:bought_two_--_both_died_on_me:e._r._vines	This hair dryer did dry my hair quickly. BUT, it quit working after a month. I exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later.	0
B000FKJS6C:effective:christine_casey	I purchased this product in an attempt to help out with jet-lag and it worked really well.  I've used it a few times since and find it doesn't send me to sleep any quicker than usual, but I don't tend to wake up through the night if I've taken it. It's obviously not something you'd want to rely on all the time, but very its handy as a occasional aid if you're having a bad run of nights. Doesn't make you feel hung-over the next day, either. Sadly, I can't buy any more because Australia doesn't recognise the product. I don't know why, because as far as I can make out its active ingredient is good old-fashioned Benadryl.	0
B000GWHDFM:cute,_but_didn't_work:kelly_s.	I got this humidifer for my daughter's bedroom.  She loved the big apple but it only ran for about one hour at a time, then automatically shut off.

B0009JOJAO:as_much_energy_as_a_glass_of_water:nathan_mohundro	I've read a lot of reviews on this product. It obviously works for some people, but be aware it doesn't work for everyone. Me being one of the latter. I've taken it twice and both times it did nothing. First time I took it before I left for work. The drive to work I was yawning and about to fall asleep. I didn't get 5 minutes of energy let alone 5 hours. Second time I took it was about 15 minutes ago. Still nothing. I was feeling sleepy and still am. My Mom, on the other hand, says it makes her energetic as hell. It might work for you. It might not, but 5 dollars (2 pack was all they had) is a lot to waste to find out.	0
B000GFCRGO:high_cost,_absolutely_no_durability_-_stay_away!!!:the_gadgeted_man_"ted"	I bought this item for my wife exactly four months ago (9-15-06) and she said it was working well for most of the four months.  She had concerns because the electrical cord which attachs to the unit rotates and when it rotated to certain angles, the heat would turn off (as indicated by the green light which is either off, flickers or solid).  As she used it, the problem became more and more frequent.  Now, the unit will not work unless it is at one point and at a certain angle (which I guess allows electricity to go to the unit).  I tried taping it to that location but the cord also has to stay at that certain angle which is impossible to maintain when using the iron.  This is not very good for such an expensive item which gets alot of twisting and turning use and should have the highest materials and workmanship to prevent electrical.  My wife admits that like anyone the unit has been dropped, but that should not cause an electrical cord problem.  Dropping the iron risks breaking the two flat iron ceramic plates, which are still perfectly intact.  The problem is that because of the cord, and the way a flat iron is used, there is alot of cord twisting.  For what is advertised as a "professional" device and at a cost which only a professional would normally purchase, we cannot believe that this could be used in a "professional" environment.  My wife only uses it six or seven times a week, not six or seven times a day like in a salon.  We highly recommend that you STAY AWAY from this product.	0

B00065IBLE:forget_about_conair_hot_lather_machines:r._ackert	The Sharper Image offers a better product which I have been using for about a year but I wanted to try the Conair for a little more "heat." I shaved with the HGM 1 and felt pretty good about it. I returned about an hour later and it had emptied an ENTIRE can of Edge Gel (unplugged) over the bathroom counter top. Go with the Sharper Image product with this little hint: Ignore the instructions regarding the one minute warm-up and let it warm up for about 4-5 minutes and you will get a decently hot lather	0
B000GWJD14:choose_the_crane_penguin_or_soccer_ball_humidifiers_instead:cathy_obrien	I really like the Crane humidifiers for children, my youngest daughter has been using the penguin at night for quite some time.  It occasionally glugs but the most part is very quiet.  So I was confident that the apple shape my elder daughter chose would be just as good.  I was surprised when it arrived as the water cannister was much flatter and smaller than I had expected and the design of the base which controled the water flow was different.  Still we started to use it and quickly discovered that it didn't detect the water level accurately and frequently turned itself off.  This may be a fault with the one I received and so I have sent it back, or it may be a design flaw with this shape.  I have just received the soccer ball and the base on this looks more like the penguin and the water cannister is more like a sphere.  So although I haven't had chance to use it I am more hopeful of success.	0
B000F5DRCS:not_too_pleased:nanci_a._akemon	I read all the reviews & thought this would do the trick. My daughter does not like the results at all. It does not straighted her hair as it states. I wish I would have spent a little more $$ on a better one	0
B000FKESG2:dead_on_arrival:j._young_"you_know_it"	As others experienced, both packs each had two dead batteries in them. I am even using the Juice Family Charger, so it isn't a brand problem.

B0007XOHL8:not_very_good:sabrina_degreenia	This item didn't work very well. It wasn't a close shave at all. I used it twice before my dog chewed it up. It left a fine stubble on my legs and kind of hurt my armpits both times i used it.	0
B00009KGGI:big_disappointment:	I was very eager to use this product.  I had all sorts of various files and clippers to keep up with and I thought this would be a great replacement.  I was a little disappointed when I had to let the hand set charge for over 18 hours before I could get full power.  My disappointment increased when the cheap plastic attachments started breaking after just a few uses.  We can not use the nail filing disks because they will cause a friction pain if you use them at the wrong angle.  I had big hopes for this product but all I got was a big disappoinment	0
B00008GQAP:flexible_hose_won't_hold_up:p._wickersham	First of all I was very disappointed when I received my Waterpik CF-203C Cascadia showerhead.  It is all plastic!  I do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs.  I thought when I oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal.  Sedondly, even with the head made of plastic, the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it.  We could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall.  We installed it repeatedly, following each step of the instructions every time, thinking we were missing something.  I eventually returned the showerhead to Amazon	0

B000BOF68Q:the_antenna_rusted_so_bad_it_broke_off_in_my_hand!:elizabeth_a._boston_"liz_moore"	I thought these looked so cute when they came out, so I put it on my wishlist last year. From Day one, it has never worked right. Sometimes it just shuts off on it's own. Of course when you turn it back on you have to start at 88.9 again. There is no visible tuner, just a tiny hard button that hurts your finger when you press it. The antenna began getting rusty after a few months, finally this morning it broke off in my hand. I was able to stick it back in, but then wasn't able to tune a station. I turned it upside down and finally got something.	0
B0006J31WO:big_fan_of_clic_products_disappointed_with_clic_sport_google_:brad_q._post	I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me!	0
B0009STCXE:i'm_disappointed...:ayla	I lovelovelove dark chocolate, (and other strong, pungent things like goat cheese and dark beer) but these taste just plain wierd. It's not terrible, but I can taste the hoodia, sorta like dried grass mixed in with the chocolate. I think they work at reducing hunger, but they give me gas so bad I can't be sure if I want to eat less because of the hoodia, or the gas. Maybe I'll try the *regular* ChocoLeans, but I won't be buying this again.	0

This product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not. This lag of simple feature make me wait for 2 hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair. Also this can not be used for continuous use, if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge	0
B000G0FAZE:this_thing_is_just_wrong:patricionado	The guy below is right.  The blades are so far down it won't cut anything but really long hairs.  How could this make it through any product test?  I tossed mine in the garbage.	0
B00005M06P:very_poor_quality_service_from_amazon:ivan	Maybe it's just my bad luck, but I ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery. I called Amazon, and they sent me a replacement quickly. The thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same *not working* condition. The same problem with the battery. I was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item, as Amazon vendor don't check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers. Be aware! Don't waste your time	0
B000BN9HR8:very_inaccurate:drpee_"drpee"	I've used the CardioChek 6 times, and had my cholesterol checked at a doctor's office during the same period.  My cholesterol levels according to the doctor's tests are always around 200.  With the CardioChek they vary by as much as 90 points.  It is a lot of trouble (and expensive) to purchase 3 sets of test strips and stab myself 3 times to test total Cholesterol, HDL Cholesterol, and Triglycerides.  No test strips are included in the package when I purchased the CardioChek.  The box says "includes check strips" but those are something other than test strips	0

B000B8KABU:should_this_be_legal?:jesse_ravenscroft_"dogg_pound"	I've been using TrimSpa X32 for over a year and, with a decent diet and regular excersise, I've lost over 40 pounds. The X32 formula has helped me maintain my weight with no side effects at all. I, too, decided to use TrimSpa Energy because it was new and improved, but was sorely disappointed. The Engergy formula is way too high powered (200mg Caffeine per pill) for me and has made me feel "sped-up", sweaty, greasy and just plain gross. And that's taking under the suggested dosage. I'm sure that it will help drop the pounds for you...at the expense of dilated pupils, shaky hands and acting sketchy. I don't think this pill should be legal and should come with stronger warnings. I'm going back to the other formula tomorrow...that is if I can get to sleep!	0

B000GDTQXS:worst_pad_ever:eric_j._stahl	This thing messed up my back.  It is extremely uncomfortable and I can't see anyone liking the feel of it.  Furthuremore it smells terrible.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT - YOU WILL REGRET IT.  (shipping wasn't bad	0
B0000AQJRE:junk:r._d._einherst	Nothing but problems with unit since I received it.  Either it did not work when I went to use it or it had lost its memory and had to be recalibrated all over again.  Never had the same weight reading twice! The only reason I rated it with 1 star is because it would not let me enter anything less	0

B000CMJJBC:not_tall_person_friendly:bei	This item is more of a foot and ankle massager if you have long legs.  I am tall with a 37" inseam.  This item is not made for someone who has longer than "average" legs unless you're looking for a foot and ankle massage rather than a calf massage.	0
B000BFJJ7E:the_worst_hair_dryer_ever!:cheryl_a._rizzo_"cheryl"	It worked fine for 2 -3  weeks and then it would get about half way through blow drying my SHORT hair and it would just stop.  I had to let it rest for 10 minutes and then it worked again.  Gradually the time it worked got shorter and shorter and eventually it just stopped all together.  Very frustrating.  Go get a professional dryer.  it might cost a bit more but it'll work!  And probably for a long time	0

13555	I've been using the Omron HBF-306 Body Fat Analyzer for a month or so now. So far I've been very impressed with its consistency. However, I would have to go to a doctor and get some sort of analysis and compare that with the Omron's measurements to see how accurate it is. It's well built and very easy to use. Once you set up your profile, it only takes a few seconds to get a read. I would give it 5 stars but again I dont yet have anything to compare its measurements with. Still a good product at a good price.	1
22441	I really like these things.  They're certainly chewy, so they can be a bit of a jaw workout, but they taste pretty good while having a lot more nutritional value than a candy bar, and they keep you going for a couple of hours.  If only they were a little cheaper, say a dollar or less per bar, I'd probably go through them a lot more quickly than I do right now	1
67812	This has got to be one of the easiest blood pressure monitors to use.  It really doesn't start until your arm is in the correct position, letting you know by beeping when you've got it right.  The display is large and easy to read and understand.  I definitely would recommend this	1
77161	I originally ordered a Tanita scale and it stopped working within two weeks.  (Amazon, of course, took it back with no problems.)  I was so glad when the Omron scale arrived.  It costs less than the Tanita but the quality is much higher.  The numbers on it are very large and easy to read.  Also, it is much easier to place your feet properly than on the Tanita.  I can't wait to try all the features.  By the way, I weighed myself over and over and my weight only varied .2 lbs. as promised.  Great deal for the money!!!	1
87198	My wife had high BP, so we got this model.  The reasons for choosing this model were that:	1
111079	my baby is 12 moth now and she uses the Pampers Cruisers (size 3) from 4-month-old. it is soft and my baby never have "rush" with it.  my whole family love this diapers.	1
144808	This is a great drink. I wanted to try something that was different, and this definately fit in. It isnt carbonated, and tastes really good.	1
170776	I have had so much fun learning Bio feedback and learnig to breath.  The exercises and the story line are really helpful to achive control and develope skills for meditation.  I highly recommned this product.  I will be purchasing the add-on in the near future	1
186695	As an Emergency Nurse Practitioner and Paramedic, I cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting electricity to an adult who is suffering from cardiac arrest.  Technology is moving quickly to get electricity to the cardiac arrest victim earlier and earlier -- and the survival rates AND quality of life rates after such an arrest are sky rocketing accordingly.	1
217052	They don't seem small at all.  I would agree that it's like a size 3, if you're talking about toddler CLOTHING, but the diaper size is different.  My daughter wears 3T clothes, size 5 Easy Ups	1

355596	I'm writing to correct a few factual errors in other reviews.  One reviewer claimed that Soldier Fuel contains no energy ingredients.  This is untrue.  Soldier Fuel was formulated by military labs specifically to provide steady energy to troops.  Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy.  Soldier Fuel contains 29 g of complex carbs (the carbs that give long-lasting energy) and 12 g of sugar.  The U.S. Military labs deemed this the perfect ratio to give you both a quick burst of energy and no crash.  Most other energy drinks on the market have lots of sugar and caffeine.  Since caffeine is a stimulant and not a source of energy, the result is a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.	1
376426	easy to use.it seems quite accurate.the only bad thing is it needs batteries,which cost a lot	1
405586	This is a fantastic tool for self improvement and relaxation and a flawed but acceptable game by gaming standards alone.  The biofeedback hardware/software is excellent and you WILL make progress whether your goals are stress reduction, better meditation, building higher self-esteem, maybe even reaching higher states of consciousness etc...The "biofeedback events" are diverse and well designed and generally just great to use!  Most of the in-game advice is also fantastic and there are a few "easter eggs" which offer very practical tools to help build your self esteem, realize your goals etc...Much of the *substance* of this project is masterfully achieved (though there are a few cheesy moments).	1

553470	I have very sensitive skin and tried wet shaving with several different electrics and this shave stick beats foam and loation hands down.  As other reviewers point out the stick is made of talc in a parafin base.  It makes dry shaving extremely smooth, as smooth as shaving with foam or lotion but without any of the mess.  You can use this with any type of electric, not just Remingtons, and it's very easy to clean out, just tap it out and/or blow and/or brush.  Highly recommende	1
600705	My physician introduced me to this item. He said very accurate when compaired to the water and pinching methods. Is affordable and easy to use. Oh, did I forget to mention, accurate compaired to a scale model I own. Amazon is great to order from, the online ordering was easy and the product arrived in 5 days!	1
B000CQBXUS:ionic_zone_good_product:k._gardner	I was very suprised at how small the units were (I ordered 2).  But they work great and run very quietly.  The filter is very easy to change.  I have one downstairs in the living room and one upstairs that I switch from bedroom to bedroom and the units work well in that amount of space.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for value for their money	1
B000GHWSG6:this_is_fabulous!:j._johnson	I received this parfum as a birthday gift and I fell in love with it as soon as I smelled it.  The scent lasts all day without being too overbearing. I swear every single time I wear this, someone stops me and asks what am I wearing.  The fragrance is crisp and sensual.  It kind of reminds me of Bath & Body Works' Moonlight Path. Buy it, you won't regret it, especially for the price that Amazon is offering it for	1
B000FRWNN0:excellent_facial_product:shelly_m._pendleton_"sunshine1130"	I purchased the Revlon Facial Steamer, this was my first purchase on line and I am very satisfied with the steamer and the service I received from amazon. The steamer is great I use it when I give myself a facial, I have not use the nail kit yet.	1
B00014FHLM:keeps_the_tummy_feeling_good.:j._crisci	I am so happy with this product. I have chronic stomach trouble and this enzyme product has saved me from many days and nights of upset stomach. If I eat too late at night or eat the "wrong" thing, I just pop a couple capsules and no problems for the night	1
B000BD0RPY:really_the_best:celestial3	IT'S AMAZING HOW A LITTLE COMMON SENSE CAN TURN INTO A MILLION YOU KNOW WHAT'S. AS SOON AS I TRIED THESE I REALIZED HOW MUCH BETTER THEY ARE THAN THE USUAL THROAT LOZENGES. WHY? BECAUSE OTHERS CAUSE YOU TO SUCK ON THEM, AND THIS STRAINS YOUR THROAT MUSCLES, WHICH IS BAD. GUMMI LOZENGES, IT'S GENIUS. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF IT. THEN AGAIN, I DID, BUT I DIDN'T CREATE AIRBORNE WHICH IS WONDERFUL IN ITSELF. REALLY, THESE LOZENGERS ARE GREAT. AT NIGHT IF YOU USE ONE THEY JUST STAY PRETTY MUCH STUCK TO THE SIDE OF YOUR THROAT AND YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP WITHOUT EVEN THE THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD SHALLOW IT AND CHOKE. JUST REMEMBER HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR A NORMAL LOZENGE TO DISOLVE WITHOUT BITTING IT ( EVEN THEN ). THESE GO PRETTY QUICK, AND WITHOUT CREWING ( WHICH IS THE BEST WAY TO USE THEM ). I MYSELF TRY TO ALWAYS HAVE THEM IN THE HOUSE. YOU SHOULD, AND WILL DO THE SAME AFTER YOU TRY THEM. ALSO THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS THE BEST. I'M ABOUT TO ORDER 10 BOXES ( WOULD ORDER MORE BUT FOR THE SHIPPING CHARGE, WHICH EVEN WITH IS STILL CHEAPER THEN TARGET ). MAYBE THE OWNER SHOULD PUT ME ON THE PAYROLL.	1
B0000AZWI8:good,_solid_toothbrush:stuart_b._warner	I like the 4 brush holder and the power and brushing action of this model.  The kids find the 30 second interval timer especially helpful to keep moving around the mouth.  It's a bit louder than the older model, probably because it's got an additional motion, and the blue charging light is bright enough for a night light.	1
B00005A441:great_set_of_curlers:pamela_roth_"bubbels"	I use these almost every morning. They're hot and ready to go in seconds. I like the nonslip surface of the curlers. Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style. I like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair. These rollers rock	1
B00099YMGK:rayovac_re-chargeable_aa_batteries:t._s._hill_"t.s,_hill_all_charged_up"	I am totally satisfied with thids product so far. Of course if the batteries run out of charge after a few charges I will be dissatisfied. I expect them to last tens of reusses if experience can be of any guideline	1

B00005R80C:get_into_those_hard_to_get_at_gum_crevices:george_d._greenberg	I have been using this attachment to my waterpik for gum disease for five years----it directs the medicine into the gum pockets easily and helps save me from really big bills at the periodontist.  It works for me, but needs to be used in conjunction with regular flossing, brushing, and generally good tooth care.	1
B00022WA5E:satisfied:joyce	I'am very satisfied with the Vidal Sassoon hairdryer. There are 3 heat settings and tips in the enclosed booklet on how to use these settings. It is a little bulky but it doesn't take long to get used to a larger dryer. I would recommend this hair dyer	1
B000EGAL5Y:it_took_my_breath_away.....:andrew_p._krage_"drew"	I rate this piece of equipment as 4 stars because I have not used it enough to know if it does everything it claims....however I have been amazed at how this little contraption does wonders on my back.	1
B000E66RQQ:life-saver:michelle	I was 5 minutes early getting out of the house to go to work one morning so I decided I could stop by a coffee shop and get a mocha. On my way back to my car the mocha "splooshed" out of the sipping hole in the to-go lid and got all over my sweater...naturally, that day it was a white silk knit sweater. So I had these large dark brown coffee/chocolate stains, and a decision to make about whether to make myself extremely late to work by going home to change.	1
B00005QZ4U:the_best:j._nordland	This stuff is AWESOME for hangovers. It was like my high school staple! I mean, I went through like a box a week. At least give it a try	1
B00070QF20:pretty_darn_good:l._vo	I have not try Proactive. The thought of buying something from an infomercial just doesn't sit well with me.  I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now (I'm 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store's brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives. I've also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you name it (even thought of laser).  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that's when I'd run out and try new products).	1

B0002UTOOQ:it_works:rani_l._gibbs_"homeschool_mom"	Yes, I did feel a difference.  Benadryl is not effective for me so I was sceptical. I am glad I found this . I use for when I need to sleep in an unfamiliar place	1
B000CFT76G:natural_energy_:randall_s._femrite_"erik's_dad"	Having tried most all Energy drinks, I can honestly say this one is different.

B0006I8I2S:best_pair_of_reading_glasses_one's_could_ever_own:frank_torres	Very convenient reading glasses. You could hang them on your neck when not using them, and not even notice they are there. They are very sturdy, and are flexible making them almost imposible to break.	1
B0009OAFU2:works_great!:r._saul_levinson_"doctorsaul"	I've had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best.  Strong motor, easy adjust, strong vacuum.  Other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me.  One wouldn't want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard.... the idea is to glide the unit over your beard... you're not raking, you're trimming!	1
B000094ZDX:good_quality_product:kumaravel_chidambaram_"kumaravel"	It is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer. It does its job pretty nicely. The dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world. A little big for travelling, but compromises with its folding handle and light weight. The disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in 240 voltage. It is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment	1
B00008K4UA:fantastic!!!:ansso	It is really great!!!  Sure, it does hurt, but not any more than waxing.  I do not shave because I get cut very easily.  This is a great alternative to expensive waxing.  Even when I have more hair it works.  I would buy this product again, and again	1

B0002KHTZ2:great_product....but_3_pack_is_the_better_buy:l._shirley_"laurie's_boomer_views"	The Oral B EB417 dual head power brush replacement does a great job of getting into tight places, reaching back teeth, removing plaque, has a nice gum massage action, and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling clean and very refreshed. The two heads work twice as good as one, but may take some getting used to if your used to a single brush head.	1
B0009OAFTS:made_a_great_gift:kristine_whitby	I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  Well made with good trim length settings, it's also easy to hold.  Recommended	1

B00022K48E:perfect_travel_razor:geoffrey_t_fortier_"mystech"	Having previously owned battery powered travel razors, I was always disappointed with their power and battery life. After all, what's the point ditching a heavier charger and razor if you have to carry a load of extra batteries and still end up stubbly faced? The Braun 370-BK was a pleasant surprise, however; powerful enough to hack through my hiking stubble and plenty of juice for an extended outing. I also liked the folding design which protects the cutting surfaces and keeps the cleaning brush from getting lost. A great piece of tech at a good price	1
B000KEMJ2I:awesome!!!:rosc	Definitely the best heating pad I've ever experienced. I'll never buy any other kind of heating pad again. This is by far the best and well worth the money. I love that it can set the temperature precisely and much higher than any other heating pads I've ever seen (that only have "high medium and low" settings, and usually the high and medium settings cause burns, or don't get hot enough, or go from barely any heat to burning!) This heating pad's lcd shows the actual temperature it's at, which is great. And yes it feels very moist, but not like you're getting dampness on your clothing. My only complaint is that it shuts off after 60 minutes. I could easily have this on all day :	1
B000EPJNMW:travel_size:wnicolay	They are a nice compact size for travel. They work as advertised, just expect to let them heat up longer than the stated "quick curl" time	1
B000062UH3:i_liked_it:sj_"srjxtd"	I got this product when the price dropped down to $12. So for that price I liked this product a lot. It heats the lotion well. Initially I thought it was small, but now I think it is the correct size. I did not realize how much better it is to apply heated lotion until this. I switch it on when I go for a bath and by the time I am back, the lotion is ready and warm. It is a great buy, and for all you bargain shoppers, wait till the price drops. It is  especially a great buy during winter	1
B000EMYJ88:great_tweezer:belissima	For me a good  tweezer is well worth paying for and this is a very good tweezer. I had the same one, this brand, for six years and then dropped it and it went out of alignment. I immediately ordered my new tweezer. If not dropped I suspect this would last a lifetime	1
B0000UJC7C:best_sleep_i've_had_in_years!:katherine_berry_"i_smirk,_therefore_i_blog."	My bedroom receives an inordinate amount of morning light and, being a light sleeper, I've tried numerous ways to protect my slumber. It doesn't help that my husband (God love him) snores as loud as a small jet plane. I've tried silicone ear plugs and satin eye masks only to find that the plugs make me feel like I have a head cold and the masks leave unwanted gaps that let in the light.	1
B000GP5HP2:crazy_sick_pumps!:manuel_sanchez_"manny"	The stuff can seem somewhat pricy (specially on a college budget) but it's well worth it. The taste isn't much to talk about; you're better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once. Then again, weightlifters don't eat supplements for taste do they? I have a huge energy problem, I lack it a lot. Between class and work, I'm usually drained at the end of the day, but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard. This isn't to say that it won't requre motivation on your part, but it sure helps. During the workout, you may notice an increase in your pump. My muscles felt so tight and big, that I just wanted to lift more and more. By the time I was done, I went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror. I've had great pumps before, but this was insane! It didn't even look like me at all; it felt great. I've been using it for 2 months now and I don't train a day without it. Highly, highly recommended	1

B000FEGUIW:norelco_7140xl:r._h._steinberg_"bobarb01"	Have had several Norelco razors over the years.  This is the closest shave I have ever gotten from any electric razor - and it is also the quietest.  Only comment is that it requires recharging more frequently that its claims but not enough of a problem to offset the quality of shave.  Highly recommend	1
B000GLN398:i_love_epilators....:catherine	The first epilator that I used was The Epi-lady with coils that came out in the 80's.  I did not use this for long....	1
B00005B6ZR:works_good_for_me:l._culp_"linaka3"	I found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn't cause my hair to frizz up and it's easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don't really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my makeup or something else. (I'm a multi-tasker anyway)  I also don't find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair.  Overall I like it.	1
B0002RQ0UK:homedics_fm-cr_foot_massager:j._white	I purchased 5 of these for myself and coworkers. We are all on our feet all day long. After one other coworker told us about the one he had, we all had to have one to help our tired feet. Everyone of us is very happy with this product. It is a great value for the price. There are other messagers that are more expensive but these are just super. We did have a problem with one, but Amazon quickly exchanged it for us. I think it was defective from the factory. Great product and even better service from Amazon	1
B0009MFQ08:bed_genie:beth_"flldiver"	WORKS GREAT AND WITH ANY MATTRESS.  DUE TO SEVERE NECK INJURIES I CAN NOW SLEEP BETTER AT A SLIGHT INCLINE.  THANKS ...	1
B00006AMSM:best_i_ever_used:jeff_ware	This razor is the best I have ever shaved with. It copes with every length of hair and angle of growth whether I shave every day, every other day, or even every third day. Perfect	1
B0009V1YPU:higher_priced_but_multi-featured:c._merrihew	Accurate scale - records use of two different users plus guests (or your chlidren!) Remembers prior info. Body fat % is a great and fairly accurate feature. These combined features make it worth the cost. Plan on reading the manual to set up	1
B0001AREJE:therapeutic_cozy_mitts:aida_"aida"	I purchased the mitts for a gift and also for myself. The person for whom I purchased them is very happy with them and so am I. I was looking for a mitt that could keep my hands as hot as possible because I have arthritis and was surprised that the heat stays for more than 1 hour. It is too soon to tell but I hope it will help me with the arthritis in my hands.	1
B00006K14U:great_pre-shave_scrub:eugene_z.	I've been using this scrub for a while - it greatly improved the quality of the shave that I get.  I get a lot less irritation.	1
B000MAV2XW:great_razor,_very_handy:emily_cremeans_"emmy_c"	This razor is fantastic. The gel pieces are very soft and keep even my dry skin from being too bad!! The only problem I had with it was the gel parts don't last quite as long as a bottle of shaving cream/gel would. But if you are looking for a quick, handy and yet still good shave, this is exactly what you are looking for	1
B0000AFUTL:jerdon_jp7506cf_wall_mirror:ted_a._kelty	Excellent product, easy to mount and the clarity of the mirror is great	1
B0006I8GWA:fantastic_glasses_ever_invented:carol_kohankie_"yankee_lady"	Now my husband can't "borrow" my gasses and I NEVER loose them.  I have one of each color and get rave comments every time I take them off in front of strangers.	1
B0009OAHIW:love_this_fragrance!:e._storm	I have loved Dolce & Gabanna light blue since it came out.  I was so excited to find it at such a competitive price at amazon, and am certainly a satisfied customer!  The shipping was so fast, I was expecting to wait at least 2 weeks, and it was delivered ahead of schedle!  Thanks so much	1
B000G1785S:braun_8985_360_complete_men's_shaver:r._ferrell	This is the best shaver I have found during 25 to 30 years of electric shaving	1
B000G17862:braun_8975_360:john_edward_sertic	My last Braun Razor was model 6550, which I purchased 7 years ago. The Braun 8975 is a pleasure using, quick and close shave. The technology has come a long way. I have always used Braun and this is by far the best yet.	1
B000BPU3KG:a_better_mousetrap:p._cleveland	This heating pad wraps around, stays put, does a perfect job and turns off by itself. Spend the money and get a better mousetrap	1
B000IOI4CY:sore_no_more!:m._cruz_"hotness_in_training"	My arms used to get so sore because I'd blow-dry my thick, frizzy, curly hair for about 1 1/2 hours and then have to go over it again with a cheapy flat iron from wal-mart.	1
B00004TUBW:great_for_kids:john_denver	Used to have a lot of liquid soap and shampoo get washed down the drain by my two kids... kids will be kids... but now they really like having their own dispenser buttons to push. Easy to mount and easy to use	1
B000AYYK5M:great_inhaler:csongor_szkalak_"chuck_s."	Great price, good product, escellent service.  I will buy from this supplier again	1
B000BIVY3I:worth_the_money!:d._brown	This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter	1
B000A1FFRM:panasonic_pro_c"urve_elite_convex_rechargeable_shaver:byong_uk_chung	I was requested to write a review by Amazon. I felt this request was premature since I used this product only for a month. So far I am quite satisfied with the user friendlyness, price, and ability to use and clean the shaver in wet environment.	1
B0002XN3V8:very_helpful_and_quick:christyl_johnson	I have medium colored hair, and I've used this trimmer many times.  It shaves away the hair just fine for me, you know need to know how to get to all the hair.  If your hair is so coarse that this trimmer doesn't work, you I'd recommend waxing!  Fast, effective, good angling	1
B000AP0HY4:great_for_the_car_or_office_chair:artist_mg	This is a great lumbar support for crappy car and office chairs.  Also check out Elaine Petrone's MIRACLE BALLS, which you can also use in the car and for other things.  The support is sturdy and has a mesh back, which helps to keep you cool and comfortable.  A GREAT deal for the cost	1
B000FKHPD0:perfect_for_tossing_into_a_bag:belacane_"the_cashmere_cat"	We all have very pale skin in my family, and these are great little "I forgot to put on sunscreen" helpers!  I keep one in the car, one in my purse, etc., so we are never without one.  Excellent product, and easy to use	1
B000FGCW1O:still_waiting:lisa_cogdill	I am having the same problem.  I ordered this product from Amazon on August 26.  It is now October 26.  I have not recieved it yet.  I have never had this problem with Amazon before.  I may have to cancel my order too and go somewhere else.  It is a shame, because Amazon does have the best price I have found so far.  I gave it 5 stars only because I had to give it a rating.  I wanted to be fair to the company, but I have honestly never used one	1
B000EJI52W:invacare_reacher:lura_e._sams	This is the best reacher I have ever used.  I am in a wheelchair due to MS and have used various types over the past 6 years but the quality and ease of use is much better with this.	1
B000GBICYE:whow!:highland_fling_"heather"	Never owned one of these electric jobs before. Could not believe how good it felt and how clean my teeth felt and looked. Hated brushing my teeth before and now I will look forward to the experience. Never wanted to spend the money before but now they are at an affordable price point. Why not have 2 and get all the different heads for a real professional clean?	1
B000BQKH8I:great_tool:h._mallory	I took "My" unit to a monthly meeting for seniors.  Their machine broke & I took mine as a replacement.  They liked it so well, they had me buy this unit for the monthly meetings.  They like all the different aspects of the machine.  A suggestions could be to include a card that you could carry in your wallet & write down the date & the numbers from the machine?	1
B0001HYMFG:good_quality._easy_to_carry.:akrulzny_"akrulzny"	This small flosses is great. To get the most out of it make sure you use the string floss and not the plastic ones that comes with it.	1
B000EPA4FW:great!:j._lam	This is the best affordable acne solution that ive ever used. I had acne on my forehead and the acne started to get smaller and even the acne on my cheeks just disappeared the next morning. On the box there is a sticker that said that it works faster than proactiv solution and its right! Proactiv takes like 2 weeks to work but this works over night. The only minor thing about it is when you put on the overnight acne control lotion, it starts feeling like its harding into a mask on your face. It feels like its restricing muscle movement on your face. Its no biggy because it works and it washes right off in the morning when im in the shower. I cant believe a little lotion can make such a difference. If you are looking for acne solution at a affordable price then this is exacly what you are looking for	1
B0001HYKBC:very_good_product:bob	(....).  It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave.  I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I think I was pressing too hard like I had to with my old razor.  Just a light touch gives a close shave.  The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn't do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose.  The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I'm using too much.  I'm still trying to get the hang of it.  It's a different experience than your basic razor	1
B000FKHJ1I:batteries:john_forsythe	THESE BATTERIES ARE USED NON-STOP, ONE SET IN AND ONE ON THE CHARGER. NO PROBLEMS WOULD BUY AGAIN !	1
B000AMBEVM:great_for_trips_to_the_lake:syke27	I bought this to try it out based on a friend's recommendation.  Previously I'd always packed a couple old ratty towels with the dog's stuff before heading to the lake or the beach.  Now I only need one towel and it dries like you'd never believe.  I have a 65 pound dog that loves the water.  I make him shake the water off himself (a trick as important as sit or lay down when you have a dog this big) then I towel him dry in less than a minute.  I now own 3 of these towels and have purchased them for just about anyone I know with a dog that gets wet.  We live in Seattle so not only are we surrounded by lakes other bodies of water, but we have rainy winters.  Having one of these towels hanging behind the door with the coats was a god send this winter as well.  I can't speak enough praise about this towel.  Though a $30 pricetag for a meer towel could seem daunting, believe me when I tell you this is worth it.  You'll end up buying two	1
B0009PVV40:loud_but_good:j._murray_"the_wife"	I've used hot air brushes for a couple years.  This works better than my last.  The low setting and the larger brush works better for me.  The high setting blows the hair off the bristles.  It's nice having the small brush option for different styles though.  I believe my hair stays styled longer and without as much work and injuries using a hot air brush versus a curling iron	1
B000065DK2:i_love_it!!!:stylish_shopper_"katie_m"	I love this straightener!  I have had two other straighteners including one from a salon that cost over $80 and this one works much better then either of the other two.  All my friends also love it and are always asking to barrow it	1
B000EON3UG:funny_but_functional:ushy	My husband bought three pairs of these glasses, and they are the only pair that he hasn't lost yet.  He absolutely loves them.  Just keep them around his neck all day and clips them together for quick use.  I think they look funny; but who cares- they are convenient and a great product	1
B000C7UXNK:correction!_18_loads,_not_40_loads!:inquisitivetoo_"kate"	A good product, to be sure...I've used Seventh Generation's other laundry detergents and have been very pleased. This "review" is however a cautionary: while it states on Amazon that each bottle cleans 40 loads, it is only rated for 18 loads. Just a heads up!	1
B00006WNQZ:reliable!:kathy_c	I've had other razors and believe me, this one is the most reliable on I've had! It works well, does NOT hurt? (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one?) A feature I like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times I need this before I use the regular cutter. Battery life is acceptable, power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need. You really can't compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used. This razor, however, has a better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade than the others. In convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere, dry, just sittin' around	1
B0009XH6V4:great_hair_dryer:c._butler	I bought this item because I was going to Europe for a month. I didn't want the hassle of using a voltage converter because you can only use one electric item at a time, unless you buy more than one converter kit. You do need a plug adaptor, (these are relatively inexpensive), then you just switch the voltage, plug it in and it works great. I used it in Switzerland, France and Italy. When I came home to the States I just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad	1
B000I62ITM:gentle_cleaning:a._burke	I appreciate the gentle, yet powerful cleaning of All Free Clear Allergen Detergent.  I have an infant & find this cleans her clothes & ours well without leaving any harsh irritants, so it's easier to do the family's laundry all together	1
B000F52VN4:great_for_travel:sun_set_"light_sleeper"	I purchased the Sound Therapy Radio to take on a trip.  My roommate is a snorer, and I figured I needed the sound. I tried it out at home and liked it.  It has a good variety of sounds and is easy to figue out how to use. The alarm and clock are added goodies for me as I was looking for a sound machine that was small and light enough for travel.  It was a good buy for my purposes.	1
B0001VKNSM:super_way_to_fight_cholesterol,_naturally!!:g._copenhaver	This has helped my wife and I to lower our cholesterol.  I take it in conjunction with Red Yeast Rice Extract(this must be taken at night) because my numbers are very high.  My wife's numbers are right on borderline.  We took blood tests before and after using it and have seen great improvements.  My numbers went down 37 points in a few months and my wife's numbers went down about half of mine.  (I also take double the dose she does.)  It's a great way to keep healthy, naturally.  My father-in-law started using it and has seen improvements, also.  His dangerous PSA numbers (prostrate) even dropped radically.  We don't know if that was due to the fish oil-but he believes it was.  His dr. said he'd never seen numbers drop that much.  We tell just about everyone we know about it.	1
B000050FE0:great-easy_to__use-reliable:m._putney	It cost a little more, but it's worth it.  It keeps the last 5 temperatures so you can compare	1
B000H84D2G:great_machine,_expensive_price:hemp	First of all, let me say this product is great in almost every way. So if you need to feel better about your nose and/or throat, go for it.	1
B0000AS33O:looking_for_something_small_and_portable?_this_is_perfect:arun_illendula	Looking for something small and portable? This is Perfec	1
B000FKJLRS:hangover_cure_you've_sought_your_entire_life.:s._ferguson	Alka-Seltzer got it right and in a big way. Drink this and 20 minutes later your headache is gone and your stomach is settled so you can motor down to the local taco stand for some much needed nourishment. I prefer the regular flavor as opposed to the citrus.	1
B000FKHMGU:i_love_it:z._patt-rappaport	I love these bags. They are easy to get out of the container, easy to open and close, and once the milk is in, they stand on their own. To be honest, I haven't tried other brands, so these may not be the only great ones	1
B000EJ5H0K:finally!:e._thornsbury	I used the Huggies Overnite diapers on my son at night until we started potty training.  I used to put absorbent inserts inside his pull-ups to get him through the night without leaks, but even that didn't work very well.  Finally, Huggies came out with an overnight pull-up - and it really works well!!!  Excellent product	1
B0006IM2HA:it_works!:lisa_guinn_"lisle_g"	I have had a number of surgeries and injuries over the years.  I see a chiropracter and a physical therapist every few weeks. Both of them work wonders, but then my body tightens up.  I can't afford to see them every day!  I bought the theracane because I saw someone else with one at a long distance cycling event.  Now I've purchased another 3 to share with friends.	1
B000FTOAZW:smells_great,_suds_well:r._allen	This is a fine, well lasting bar of soup that smells like sweet oranges--you will catch wiffs of the very pleasant fragrance every time you enter the bathroom.  It reminds me of tangerine lifesavers, if that helps.	1
B00014IHKA:a_real_"source_of_life":syl_"sdw"	After 6 months of unexplained intense fatigue and malaise, numerous doctor visits without results, I obtained Source of Life vitamins upon the recommendation of a friend whose physician had recommended it for them.  With the very first dose, I went from dragging around to walking around--while most vitamins require weeks of use before results are seen.	1
B0007DHH88:very_good_toothbrush!:james_"timothy"	I bought this toothbrush a month ago, and have been very satistfied with it. The battery lasts about a month and the brush leaves me with a clean feeling that you can't get from a manual toothbrush. The price is good, the battery life is good, and the battery door is very easy to open! I would buy it again!	1
B000AM85RI:it_gets_what_vacuums_dont!_also,_great_for_older_folks...:k._corn_"reviewer"	This is one of those products I'd put on my "must have" list if I had an elderly parent who couldn't handle a vaccumm and had some area rugs or runners near the front door or entrance to any room. For daily touch-ups, these things can't be beat. They are extremely light and get all the stuff that gets dragged into the house between deep vacuuming.	1
B000KFKMY4:sweet_heat_relief:laura_j.	I've owned two Thermaphore heating pads, different sizes, for many years and I'm using one right now! They're quality made to last a lifetime. They trap moisture from the air so no need for soaking sponges to insert. The trigger switch allows you to heat as needed as hot as you like and if you fall asleep there are no worries of burns..if the trigger isn't depressed it isn't heating. I wouldn't be without mine. It helps me manage my arthritis/fibromylagia/nerve damage pain. I've recommended it to many of my friends who have been very pleased as well.	1
B000H3D3YA:great_foundation:nicole_martinez	I am one of the people who just doesn't like applying liquid foundation and cannot do it well, but needs more than just the light coverage of powder foundation. The New Complexion cream foundations do exactly that. I have used numerous cream (or liquid-powder) foundations and this is by far the best and at a good price as well!	1
B00006WNMI:great_filter_system:faelinn_jacobs_"fj"	The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste	1
B000CEM40S:best_blowdryer_i've_ever_owned!!!:iamme._"avidly_addicted_2_books!"	Love it, love it, love it!  It got my hair soooooo straight and in record time.  I highly recommend this product.  Esp. for African American hairtypes.  :-	1
B00092M2W8:i_love_it!:chic	It usually takes forever for me to dry my hair, but it dried really fast and STRAIGHT!  I can go a few extra weeks without a relaxer!  And the color is beautiful... I just love orange :O	1
B000FFAAD2:these_things_rock,_and_they're_sexy_too!:rpt1700_"rpt1700"	Man these things are the best. They can handle whatever issues I throw at them. I've done considerable load testing as I'm a truck driver who makes infrequent stops. Thanks for making my life easier. I'm totally back into life with Depends	1
B00006WNQ9:way_better_that_models_that_cost_seven_times_as_much;_highly_recommended:amrit_tiwana_"www.bus.iastate.edu/tiwana"	This is one of the nicest electric shavers that I've owned and the first wet-type shaver. I have previously owned Norelcos for over a decade. The original Norelcos (made in Holland) were fine but the recent ones have pathetic quality and they literally pull hair! It is painful! I eventually gave up trying to use my replacement lift-and-cut Norelco and decided to try out a high end model that cost close to two hundred dollars. Bad idea - you don't always get what you pay for! I was not quite happy with that either and after a two year haitus with disposable Gillettes, decided to try a wet shaver. I took my chance on this one, based solely on the reviews here. This is the very first "wet" shaver I've used and absolutely love it. It gives a close enough shave but not too close. You can use it with whatever shaving cream you use.	1
B000G2B2PY:best_bag_ever!:a._pearson	I bought this bag for my husband as a surprise (as I had bought another brand, and he did not like the Asian floral print).  It's very roomy, looks great, fits ergonomically.  I really love the pocket design and the space that they have, as well as the interior design.  Fits things better than my own bag!  My husband loves it and can't wait to use it!  Plus that, this is the best price I've seen online, and of course, Amazon ships quickly and accurately	1
B0000AFUT3:jerdon_trifold_lighted_mirror_-_excellent_choice:terry_a._thom	There are a lot of positive comments about this mirror and some very negative comments.  I weighed both before I made my decision and chose to give more weight to the positive comments.  I am glad I did.  The light from the mirror is bright, the slide bar for the different light settings works very well.  If you hold the switch to the count of 2 or 3 and then release the lights work every time.  I enjoy the mirror very much and would buy another or recommend that someone buy it for their use.	1
B0006J31WE:perfect_for_scooter_use!:j._kulas	I just bought a Vespa scooter for short trips since the gas prices are so high.  I needed some eye protection that would work with my helmet.  These goggles are awesome!  They fit perfectly inside my helmet, and because the wrap around my head, they stay put.  The magnets in front are very strong so the goggles don't move.  The eye cups are just the right size and they're padded for comfort. These goggles have far exceeded my expectations.	1
B000KK02X0:works_great:dave_christensen_"daveledzep"	this thing is really cool and works very easily.  Once you perform	1
B000053389:follow_directions:	This product does wonders. It helped with blotchy skin and made my whole face feel softer yet firmer within a week. Like another customer, I have sensitive skin. I didn't feel this dried my skin out at all. But a word to the wise, make sure to read the directions carefully, this product is not meant for use around the eyes which might explain some complaints. If used properly, its fantastic	1
B000G7SJUA:just_what_i_wanted:enid_sefcovic	I love the smell of an essential oil in the air. I've tried tealight burners, a smear on a low-burning lamp, and a miniature crockpot designed for aromatherapy. The PearlEssence Spa Mist is absolutely the best ever for diffusing an odor and continuing to diffuse it for an extended period of time. Because I live in a humid climate, I was concerned that misting would only add to mold problems and perhaps mar wooden furniture. The cool mist instantly absorbs even into our air. The light show of the base can be turned off, but I like it most of the time. Product was offered for $10 less than at a well-known local natural market chain, and shipping was free with my order over $25 with other products.	1
B00080M29Y:this_is_a_very_good_product_for_stress_management:ahmad_i.	I started taking Anxietol 7 to help me with my stress at work. I am not usually a stressed out sort of person however I recently got transfered to NYC and I'm from Utah, just that move itself is enough to stress anyone out. I am working as a trader and it is very high energy. Anxietol 7 is helping me cope with my new life here	1
B000B6CR6S:very_satisfied:preston_r._winfrey	The LifeSource BP Monitor was just what I wanted and was priced just right.  It was delivered in a timely manner and I am a happy camper along with my wife. Thanks.	1
B000A6HM9G:great_product:paula_a._dodd_"paula"	Lightweight, easy to transport, easy to put together.  Just remember, the person in the chair cannot maneuver on their own.  Someone must be able to push.  But what a great product	1
B000BX5FS8:good_stuff!:c._williams	This product was reffered to me by my hairstylist after she noticed alot of frizziness and breakage in my hair. This has worked beautifully to protect my hair from the blowdryer and straightening iron! I would give this product 10 stars if it were available! My hair is very smooth and very healthy looking because of this product and other products by Chi.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone	1
B00068F15K:excellent_product:jeffrey_ford_clarke	Excellent product, good quality at a good price. I bought this Whal's trimmer to replace a Whal's trimmer that I have used for over 15 years. That alone speaks for itself	1
B0000YUW4U:fantastic_iron:tamara_a._lakeman	I just bought this iron and I couldn't be happier. It's the perfect size and weight. The plates aren't unmanageably large, or pitifully small... It heats up incredibly fast-- we're talking in less than 60 seconds. I have short-ish, wavy and coarse hair- it's straight and silky smooth within 5 minutes. HAI is a brand used in many salons and it's all for a reason- they make fantastic flat irons. If you bought this same iron at a salon, you could easily pay upwards of $150 in Canada... so I consider this price an awesome deal	1
B0006H9WII:feel_the_difference_from_just_the_first_use:dori_"lilred6675"	I am so happy with Aquasana Shower Filter. I live in a building where the water is so harsh and sometimes discolored. As a consequence, my skin shortly turned dry and I continuously got skin problems. I even thought about buying drinking water to clean my face everyday. Now that I have found Aquasana, I feel so happy. It does what it promises. I could feel the smoother skin by just using it from the first time. And it did feel like showering in natural spring water. I couldn't be happier with this product	1
B00008V407:can't_shave_so_love_this!:wrdgal_"weird_old_gal"	Shaving gives me all sorts of problems, I must have super sensitive skin or something. I cannot afford laser and wax just isn't my thing.	1
B000BTHJCM:tide_he_powder:k._seaquist_"kbs"	I love that stuff!  And now you haven't had it - but I need more - please make it available again.  Thanks	1
B000GDA3GW:great_product_but....:t._howeth_"a_happy_mom"	I got this for my husband and he states that the trimmer is great but it needs to have a smaller base. The charger part of the trimmer is just too big. Even though it is big for size it does not hold all the attachments. He would recommend the trimmer to do the job it is intended for	1
B0009JOJAO:great_for_when_you_have_a_cold!:a._pechota	I had a horrible cold, felt like complete #### but I HAD to work. This little two ounce vitamin B shot knocked the crappy feeling outta me and I was able to get some work done. There really is no crash and the taste isn't that bad. ..it tastes like a melted freeze pop.	1
B000LQI2S0:great_for_children:e._shearer	We originally got this to replace the "fan noise" in the winter due to our sons' room being so cold.  The first couple days the sound seemed so loud but you quickly get used to it.  We've discovered it's very helpful for blocking out the noise of other children running through the house while our newborn is sleeping in addition to the city noises at night.  With the adjustability dials it's ideal for a nursery or bedroom for those who cannot sleep without a fan.  It doesn't however, cover the sound of someone coughing or snoring loudly.  Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sound machine for environmental noise, especially for children	1
B000GFCRGO:salon-quality_tool:m._sheen	My hair is very wavy and frizzy, I have to condition my hair every day so it doesn't look dry and damaged. 2 weeks ago I got my hair cut, the stylist used a Sedu straightener on me. Wow! Suddenly, my hair was stick straight and super glossy (really brought out the natural highlights). I bought one from him for $199 (should have checked the Internet first).	1
B0009XH6OG:a_very_close_shave_w/no_razor_bumps!:nystateofmind	I've been using this for the last 3 months and I'm a very satisfied customer. I get a very close shave, and no razor bumpors. I'm Afircan American and my beard is coarse and curly, sometimes with many razor this can lead to ingrown   hair problems. I highly recommend this, because it's a much close shave than the typical elctric razors by brands such as Braun and Norelic. It's very cheap and the only maintainence is clipper oil. I cam across these because the only time I would get a great shave was at the barber. When he used clippers on me I've never had any problems with ingrown hair, therefore I decided to own my own pair of clippers. I'm very pleased with with product and highly recommended as a very effective and affordable method for shaving and trimming	1
B0007XY8VC:worth_the_money:christina_gaubert	I was hesitant to spend this much money on a shaver but I am so glad I did. This one gives me a really good shave. I have had it for one month and have not used a hand razor since. Another review says the cleaning process is a bit loud, which it is but since you turn it on and leave it, I just close the bathroom door so the noise is not a problem.	1
B00014D1MY:emu_oil:carol_c._mcfall	I bought this for my husband.  He had a plantars wart on the bottom of his foot that was removed but became a callus that gave him pain.  Emu oil is the first thing that softened it and it is better than it has ever been and he had suffered with it for years	1
B000FEKMQ8:very_soothing:kathie_rohlfing	This is very soothing for people with arthritis or any kind of injury and makes your hand feel wonderful	1
B000FGXZBA:worth_your_money:ms._charles_p._feliciano_sr._"big_daddy_chuck"	this is the best bargain for your money.pampers swaddlers are better than pampers. even better than costco brand. worth every penny	1
B0006I8I0K:hairy_problem:ben_g._baltes	These glasses are a great idea.  However, they do not work with long hair.  The back "strap" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose (so you can see over them for distance).  Long hair lays on the back of the glasses and pushes them down in the back, making the front of the glasses pop up and placing the lenses right in front of the eyes. I guess most people who need reading glasses don't have long hair	1
B00069TT66:no_more_neck_pain:ladynuca	I was suffering from intense neck and shoulder pain before I started using this pillow.  When I started sleeping on it a couple of months ago, the pain was gone after the first night, and it hasn't come back since then.  It supports my neck perfectly.  I highly recommend	1
B0006I8HZQ:did_not_disappoint:m._brick_"maryb889"	I saw these reading glasses on CSI:NY and just had to have them! It's really nice to have a quality pair of reading glasses...and the WOW factor doesn't hurt either! I've read some of the reviews and can see where women with hair past their shoulders might have a problem with this type of glasses. My hair is shortish (layered to the bottom of my neck) and I wouldn't want it any longer if I was going to wear these glasses a lot...which I do! They aren't portable...but they aren't supposed to be. I keep mine in my office where I need to take them on and off the most frequently. I'll probably get another pair for home but I'll used my old ones I can put in my case for carrying in my purse. All in all...I'm very glad I got them	1
B000063XHR:top_notch:donn_ross	I've had this trimmer for 10 years and never had a problem.  Sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works.  Never falls apart and cut hair great.  I'd buy another if this one would ever wear out!	1
B000GTRWZ6:hydrabrush:e._ward	After brushing with the HydraBrush, my teeth feel as clean as when I've been to the dental hygenist.	1
B00024D9NY:almost_perfect:mami_luvr_"music_forever"	the pills really do work.  I stopped taking stacker over a year ago and i stopped my routine workouts and i gained 40 lbs in just one year!  I was so frustrated and dissapointed at myself so i started going to the gym but i was finding it hard to motivate myself to do anything while at the gym.  I just started taking stacker3 for one week and already i have dropped almost 10 lbs (of course with excersise as well)  This pill not only helps with energy but as i have read, it also works as a metabolism enhancing property! Thank you NVE for a great product.  THe only negative thing about it is that i sometimes feel dizzy and a numbness to my fingers.  (that was the reason i stopped taking it in the first place but its really not life threatening or as serious as it may sound)	1
B00005J6QS:good_moisturizer:betty_smith	It's pretty good...don't see it making anything "firmer" but it works nicely as a moisturizer.  I checked the internet and apparently the person posting stuff above has been posting the same thing [about it ruining their life] all over the net.	1
B0007VO08U:a_terrific_walker:c._keller	My husband was totally delighted with the Rollator Walker.  It is so much easier to use than the typical walker that we had to wonder why anyone wouldn't want this new, much more attractive kind.  It folds up very easily when not in use and the basket comes in very handy for carrying things.  When folded up it fits in the back seat of our car, and it would probably fit in the trunk if your truck is fairly large.  We put it together in about 5 minutes and the price was great, what more can you ask	1
B000FLXUNI:great_handle-ability:mom_x_3	these wipes are great.  i have three children and have used the pampers, huggies, and house-brand wipes.  the huggies are too thick and it seems you need more of them to get the job done. house-brand don't smell as good and tend to be a bit rough.  the pampers are thin, soft, and moist enough to get the job done-because they are thin, they can be maneuvered around in all the important places and folded / refolded for 100% useage (unlike the huggies that once they are folded they become too thick to maneuver).  definitely not too dry as other reviewers have said.  if you want something moister, go get a paper towel and wet it with water	1
B0009STCXE:they_work_and_are_delicious:readerchris	I love the taste of these little Chocolates. I find that I need to have one 1 hour before eating - less and they don't work. If I have  two in one day (late morning, mid-afternoon) the effect is cumalative. I can eat a very light dinner and be completely satisfied	1
B0006HCE5Q:very_relaxing:lauren	I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches.  I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches.  I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache.  If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another	1
B0006TU0SM:it_works._:d._denoyer	I'm not sure how well since I have never used anything like this before, but my bath water feel a whole lot better and I do not itch for an hour afterwards. I probably should have rated a 5 star, but I really have no base for comparing. I will definitely buy this product again.	1
B0002VJMUQ:definitely_a_product_that_gives_interesting_results:irini_dobeck_"autumnwilderland"	I found this product after reading a review of it on hairboutique.com.  The length of my hair seemed to have reached a plateau just below my shoulders and after year seemed to have grown no longer.  I decided to try this product to see if it worked.  As hair growth is normally clocked at an 1/8 of an inch per month, I decided to monitor the results in my own little "clinical test."  This was actually pretty easy because I colour my hair so I'd easily be able to see how much growth there was each month.	1
B0000C88FK:magnifica_afeitadora:rafael_quero_"querora"	Yo nunca habia usado una afeitadora electrica y al comprar esta hice una excelente inversion porque me deja la piel practicamente lisa, muy suave y lo mejor de todo no tengo que usar agua. Le dura la bateria y se limpia muy facilmente con el cepillito que trae. Si compras el polvo de remington que ellos recomiendan es mucho mejor porque la afeitadora se desliza con mas suavidad. Saludos Rafael desde Cabimas Venezuel	1
B00005MF8Y:this_is_great!:sherry_a._cummings	I bought this as a present for my mother but tried it first to be sure it was worth the money.  It really is!  After using this the recomended 15 minuets, my feet felt just like they did when I had a professional foot massage!  I highly recomend this for anyone who enjoys having thier feet massaged	1
B0001BRCUY:best_whey_best_taste:m._arida	I love this product. It just tastes great especially with milk.	1
B000GB1HMI:sleep_better!:jess	I ordered 1 for my twin bed to try out.  Loved it, so I ordered a full and kingsize too!  I find I don't move around as much as I used to.  A more restfull sleep	1
B0006I8I14:a_great_idea!__i_always_know_where_my_glasses_are_now.:m._m._hand_"sassy_reader"	I have several of these glasses now.  Love them. They are strong and adjustable and so much better then wearing the granny cord around your neck.  I wish there was a berrer looking sunglass besides that goggle looking one.  Good price and good product.	1
B0001ASC7M:told_this_was_great:very_happy	i purchused this for my daughter with vision then my vision impaired daughter used it while she was at home she loved it, so now i'm buying her one for her new ap	1
B000FTOB06:smells_wonderful!!_and_cleans_well_too!:y._hu_"blackrose36"	I love this soap, it's a little big and hard to hold during shower, but the smell totally makes up for it!  it has a very strong (but good) grapefruit smell, it's very fresh and rinses completely off	1
B000CMTWQ4:new_user:jjl	This is my first electric shaver and I am very pleased with the results.  Use the Trimmer to reduce the length of the hair and then use the cleancut to "make it smooth".  No knicks no cuts!!! I am pleased!	1
B000CQIREI:as_good_as_ever:chan_fong_cheok_"zephead"	Tastes great, and it's good for a normal weight training person like me	1
B00008ZPGA:i'm_a_believer!:virginia_allain_"(retired_librarian)"	I started using this several months ago after seeing it chosen as the best by Consumer's Report.  Within a few weeks, I could see measurable improvement in my skin.  Sure, not all the deep wrinkles went away, but enough of the smaller ones smoothed away so my 58-year-old skin looks younger.	1
B00015QE22:good_stuff:william_n._grigg_jr._"massage_guy"	Kama Sutra Massage Oil in the 8oz bottle is really good stuff!	1
B000BN9HR8:worked_well_for_me:lynette_stakler	I thought this was convenient and easy to use. Seemed to give a pretty accurate reading.	1
B000FKHSAK:good_for_shaving.:erik_a._olson_"holy_roller_reviews"	Back in the early 90s I was going through a bad acne period.  I finally visited a dermatologist, and he put me on an Accutane regimen.  I had sensitive skin and a tough beard, so regular shaving cream was too harsh (especially while taking Accutane - the solid brush-on cream I was using at the time burned the edges of my lips).  He recommended that I shave with Cetaphil.  Years later, my skin and beard are still troublesome.  Therefore, I've kept Cetaphil as a part of my shaving regimen.	1
B00005B70C:works_great:j._adair	This was bought as a gift for my Dad, who has limited mobility. It's easy for him to use, easy to handle and gives him a great shave. He really likes it	1
B000065AB0:much_better_than_just_the_'mach_3',_hubby_says.:amazon.com_buyer	I got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and I thought they'd improve upon the Mach3.  Well they did!  This Turbo brand of Mach 3 is actually much better; his shave lasts longer, the blades last longer, and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave.  I choose this one over that Mach3 power vibrating blade because, I don't know, a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion.  Haha...	1
B000FKGHFM:best_sunblock_around!:megan_"megs"	I am very fair and find it difficult to enjoy the sun because I constantly burn.  I have tried everything and have never been completely satisfied.  I went on my honeymoon to the Maldives in November and was able to stay out in the sun, go swimming and I did not have to constantly reapply.  I didn't get burned once!  Bull Frog Superblock is the best sunblock around	1
B00008IHO3:great_sunscreen_for_combination/oily_skin!:alfred_racho	I cannot say how well this product really compares to other sunscreens in terms of sun protection. But it does have the right ingredients that most top-rated sunscreens/sunblocks use, so it should be at least on par with them.	1
B0000UNP9S:acuvibe_massager:rita	this is a wonderfull massager, i have had other ones in the past and they were'nt as good as this one. for $50 this massager is great it really was well worth the money for what it gives out to yourself. the power on it was amazing i was really shocked i dident think it would be that much in a good way though. so i was very pleased with buying this acuvibe massager and it really does work great so i hope i helped you make your chose right	1
B000FKGIG0:wonderful_product:w._e._chase	Great for people with sensitive skin or prone to acne.  I began using neutrogena as a teenager 25 years ago.  It helped clear up teen acne & has kept my skin free of razor burn in more recent years	1
B00005331R:natrual_gentle_cleanser_:naoki_"naoki"	I am a woman of color and this product eliminates any discoloration without irritation or disturbing my combination skin. I highly recommend this product for women who need to brighten their appearance once a week.	1
B000FKHX78:chronic_sinus_relief:gordon_w._sheill	When I get a sinus infection, it stays and builds much congestion. Rx and over-the-counter has limited value. One event that led to my first (I am 69) severe asthma event, which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury.	1
B000FKJYYI:one_of_the_best_out_there!:s._thacker	I have tried a gazillion of these "diet" protein bars. This is the only one I've actually found so far that tastes good.	1
B000BX1MKI:good_for_pressure_points:lav_"lav_nyc"	This is a good massager that can hone in on the pressure points. The knob is a little large for getting at specific reflex spots, but generally does the job	1
B000FEP6UK:very_nice!_wonderful--keeping_my_feet_&_hands_moist_:):uber_goober_"photo_geek"	This is the best investment ever! They start you out with everything you need from the liners to the paraffin. It was so easy to set up & start enjoying. I've used it on average twice a week and my feet & hands are so wonderfully moist--even in this winter weather. My heels are no longer cracked & my cuticles are so healthy--not snagging at all. Thank you for this perfect product & so much cheaper than going to the salon! It's so relaxing (I use lavender) as I do this just before bed	1
B0007DHH92:it_lasted_a_month_before_show_wearing:l._hang_"clean_teeth"	maybe because I ordered a "medium".  It works fine otherwise.  I recommend it	1
B0000UTURY:great_at_my_workplace.._!:krishna_kandula_venkata_rama_"ram"	I have a severe dry eye problem and i found in internet that a humidifier may help.	1
B000GTRWZG:hydrabrush_is_an_excellent_power_toothbrush:j._boltz	Hydrabrush is an excellent power toothbrush because the brushHead has more surfaces to get at your teeth and gum line making the brushing very comfortable and refreshing afterwards. I use the soft brushHead because I used to have gingivitis and my gums were red and swollen, but since using the Hydrabrush and the 8 brushes (4 on each side) I don't have to worry about missing when I brush my teeth. Excellent product.	1
561845	I bought this watch for my husband, but didn't take the time to read the description carefully.  So it's my fault I had to send it back. He is in the Army and leaving soon for Iraq.  I thought this sturdy watch would be a perfect gift.  Unfortunately it does not work if you're more than 2,000 miles from Colorado. If you are not going to leave the continental United States I suppose it would be a good watch	0
B0006ZWPPC:locket_is_very_small:a._fairchild_"mom_of_2_girls"	We bought this locket for my daughter, and had it personalized with her initials on one side, and the year on the other.  This is such a small locket, that it will be very hard to put a picture in it.  Also, the locket is very, very hard to open.  The top of the heart wasn't closed all the way, so the locket kept falling off the chain, we had to have it fixed.  Now it stays together, my daughter loves it and wears it every day, but I would have bought a different locket if I had realized how small this is, and that we would have to do some repairs on it before it could be worn	0
B000CBDZCM:don't_buy_this:s._chu	I bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews. I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover	0
B000E4ARGY:too_small:kenneth_perreira	This was a cute locket but far too small to put any sort of a photo in it . The only use it would serve would be a charm never to be opened. Not worth the price	0
B0000AZ101:14k_yellow_gold_three_prong_6mm_trillion_amethyst_stud_earrings_:william_e._faraone	The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products	0
B0009P678A:read_the_other_reviews_for_invicta_women's_diver_watches:3fatponies_"horse_owner"	Fair warning--had I had the benefit of some of the reviews that have since appeared about this company's watches, I never would have bought one.  Do yourself a favor and read the reviews for the various models before wasting your money.  The percentage of watches that work for any length of time is distressingly low	0
B000CRXCLK:looks_cheap_and_awful:silver_girl	This ring does NOT look as pictured.  It arrived today (almost 3 weeks after I ordered it) and is extremely thin, has tarnish marks, and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places.  It looks like it came out of a vending machine and I'm obviously pretty disappointed.  I won't be buying anything from this vendor again	0
B00020J18A:never_kept_time:jen_in_kentucky	I bought two of these one for each of my boys for Christmas.  One of the two watches never did keep time properly.  I even changed the battery.  An expensive fix that did not work.	0
B000FF8QXI:when_i_received_my_watch_it_looks_damaged:disappointed_mike	As title says.  There were kind of a "water mark" on the face of the watch, maybe a leak from the solar panel?  I did not exchange for another one because it is a cheap watch, no point paying shipping back and forth.	0
B0000643Q9:glass_cracked_without_any_impact_-_do_not_buy:computerguy	Nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after LESS THAN 2 month of use in office environment glass CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT whatsoever. Now I'll have to find out if Skagen's customer service is any good. For $70 watch I certainly expected better quality.	0
B000KUFJNI:not_as_expected:a._spice	I can see why they are priced so low, I figured that they would look like the photo, or something like it but the ones I received are very cloudy.  I guess you get what you are paying for.  As for the K clarity, I have no idea what that is so I never thought they would look this bad	0
B000KPWC10:watch_manual:rodney_w._cooper	Great watch,manual very bad.All depends on how much time you have to invest.It will take it because of sorry manual	0
B0000X044O:looks_cheap,_gimmicky_and_i_sent_it_back:roland_wooster	It was larger than I expected from the images, thicker too. In my opinion it didn't look as classy as the picture made me believe.	0
B000B66OI0:very_disappointed:lauren_carruthers_"lauren_c"	I was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is.  I don't know if the measurements were in the description for it or not, or if they were and I just didn't see or pay attention to them, but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it's meant for a very young child.  The necklace may be 18", but the pendant itself was so small, not at all what I was looking for.  So i'm going to give this as a gift for a niece.  What I was really wanting was a larger, heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult.  Never have found one yet.	0
B000KNCKP0:poor_quality:episcomdiv_"bbfk2000"	My order arrived quickly but upon FIRST use, the clasp broke on this necklace.  Since it wasn't an expensive item, I joined the ends together with a small wire ring I already owned, since it would have cost more to send the item back and have replaced...perhaps with another faulty item.  As they say, "you get what you pay for!	0
B000F3O8WI:tiny_tots_toy_turtle:jerry_cranmer	Here is an example of the deception of photos on the net. The smallest photo they showed of these earings was 4x larger than the actual product!!	0
B0002ZJBYE:please_heed_negative_reviews_regarding_drooping_on_the_ear!:melvin_fields_"tech_expert"	I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund	0

B000F3S7PW:product_not_as_is_described:classic_book_lover	I love the size (small) and quality of these earrings that were ordered for my 6 year old.  The website picture shows them as a blue and purple color.  When I got them they were pink and green, even the replacements they sent were pink and green.  I have not been happy with their customer service on these and will not order jewelry again.	0
B00064C4Y0:it's_terrible:elise_m._edson_"butterfly"	I bought this ring for my fiance, since i have one, and it's a terrible ring.  We got it apart, and then.....have not been able to get it back together, it's been over a month now, we went online to get the directions, that didn't help either. Plus, the ring is so cheap, it warmed up with the effort from our hands and bent out of shape. It is cheap and completely useless.	0

B0009KNC10:earrings_not_what_i_expected:linda_m._allen	I purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year-old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece's wedding.  When the purchase arrived, they were too small for my granddaughter.  Therefore I had to return them	0
B000B6CSIU:big_disappointment!!!:t._doan	I read all these nice reviews and had a good impression of these earrings. I should NEVER have bought these!! They look NOTHING like the picture. If you get these earrings you will be setting yourself up to be disappointed. They look cheap and tacky, like something you pay 25 cents for out of a gum ball machine	0
B000EREX34:waterproof_watch_case_opener_in_wooden_box:paula_m._baskette	Not what I expected.  The box was handmade, the instructions were some other tool.  I have contacted seller and was not satisfied with response	0
B000DT8SY8:very_loud!:a._gyurnek	I bought this winder for my husband because of the price. But it is so loud!!!!  We had to put it another room because it was way too noisy for the bedroom. I wouldn't recommend this. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for.	0

B000B61NCC:not_as_it_looks_in_picture!:joanne54	There aren't any colors in this pendant, just a ugly topaz which ruins the pendant, same happened with heart I ordered from this seller.

B000HGSSNS:blue_is_in_the_eyes_of_the_beholder:minh_h._vo_"vomeister"	Please read Mr. Marcus C. Dunn's review because I agree with all his negative and positive points about these earrings.	0
B000GHGFTM:disappointed:greer_a._barnes	This was a present to myself for my birthday.  I thought I was purchasing a quality product.  Two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working.  I took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again.  I sent it back for a refund and not very happy I have to pay a restock fee for a defective item.  I will be rethinking future purchases...	0

B0000AZ0Y8:too_big_for_me!:daisy_samuels	These are nice amethyst earrings, nice purple color. However I'm returning them because they're too big for my ears. The basket setting makes them stick out too much. The setting is not very pretty. The gems are set very low into the basket	0
B0000AZ10J:not_what_i_thought:slava_shyket	The aquamarine earrings do not look at all like aquamarine, which is supposed to be light blue. They had no color, so I ended up returning them	0
B0002CVMVC:shoddy_quality:s._l._mctier	Product is not as pictured. Looks like a dimestore fake. I had purchased this for one of my bridesmaids, and now have to spend more money to buy her something else. I would not give this to a 4 year old-- let alone a 34 year old. I am very disappointed!!!!!!!!!	0
B0001WQ05G:not_what_i_was_expecting:c._dipiero	I was very disappointed in this purchase, and eventually ended up returning it.  The actual product did not live up to my expectation.  While the cross was of average quality (not great, but OK), the chain was very cheaply made.  It did not even have a clasp on it -- you had to pull it over your head to get it on.  The price of this item did not match the quality of the product, by any means.  Even though I was disappointed with the item, I have to say that the company was extremely easy to work with as far as getting a refund.  Their customer service staff were very friendly and took the item back, no questions asked.	0
B0000C9ZCY:skagen_watch_problem_-_don't_buy_their_watches-crystals_crack:jzehaz_"jzehaz"	I would rate this zero stars but the system will not allow me to do this - hence the one star.I bought this watch for my wife as a 2006 Christmas present. The crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. The elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. I went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with Skagen watches. I called Skagen, seems they are aware of this problem too. However the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal, pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. As I paid $65.00 for the watch I consider this a total ripoff. I would not buy another product from Skagen and recommend that Amazon discontinue selling any Skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. It is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. Or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates	0

B00020J1LC:having_difficulty_setting_this_up...:michael_s._milliken	My wife received this heart rate monitor from me for Christmas 2005. First my wife, them my father in law and then finally I have been unable to get the chest strap to begin transmitting to the wrist watch. We have read the documentation and looked at the Timex web page without success so far. It is now January 2nd and I still cannot get it working. I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation.	0
B000LGFI9G:very_dissapointed_-_valentine's_day_nightmare:n._holter	I placed my order with little time to spare before Valentine's Day. Amazon delivered the item is a timely fashion as usual!! However, to my disappointment, when I opened the box the item came in... it looked TERRIBLE. I though the price was a steal, but feel as if I paid way too much for what was received.	0

B000EXQZXE:don't_buy_this_for_the_compass:pk	This product is not worth the price by itself.  It's fair at buy-1-get-4-free.  The time function works fine.  The compass, on the other hand, is virtually useless.  Having gotten 5 watches, all 5 compasses were pointing in different directions	0
B0007TJZUK:not_pleased_with_the_aesthetics:nm	I really liked the watch as it looked in the picture. But, when I purchased it, I realized that its way too shiny. If you have a thin wrist, then the watch looks really bulky. Besides, the 12 o'clock mark on the watch is not exactly to the north. So, you have to tilt your head and make sense of the time...	0
B000F3Q2ZO:my_experience:s._liu	I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago. The reason is that there is a half arrow at the end of the hook which is used to lock the earring. I tried to wear them, but the half arrow was too big, and I couldn't get them through my earlopes.	0
B0007VDN6K:instructions_please:dasn0wman_"dasn0wman"	The instructions that you do get are wrong.  The items I get and the ones listed are totally different.  It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools.  Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it.  The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me!	0
B00068TJ30:zero_stars____i_am_in_total_shock!_:michael_colagiacomi_"bird432"	I've bought a LOT from Amazon over the years. This was the first watch though. I've bought and owned several SEIKO watches. This is probably the WORST experience that I've ever had with Amazon and Seiko too!	0
B0007L79BK:this_"glass"_teardrop_is_plastic!!:smr777	This set of earrings was only $10 and the delivery from Silver Insanity was fast, but false advertising really pisses me off.  They do not look nearly as nice as the picture, and in fact the "glass" part of the earring is plastic...and it even has bubbles in it. It's ugly. The other earrings that I bought from them also do not look much like their photos	0

B000BC8H02:not_as_it_looks!:joanne54	Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1.  Speedy delivery was the only positive	0
B0000B35FY:garbage!!!:g._kwan	I bought these earrings as a gift for my sister and the first time she wore them the post fell off. I felt like the biggest loser. When I contacted Amazon, they said that because it was over 2 months that I had bought the earrings I couldn't return them. What a rip off. These earrings don't even deserve 1 star	0
B00080HDQG:expensive_ship:bod_"mae"	I recived the watch and it is fine, however I want to complain above Amazon's way to pack purchases, Amazon pack a tiny watch box in a huge box, then I have to pay lots of money paying a mail forwarder because to  this policy.	0

B000EG6FZY:not_as_i_expected:mischa_valenci_"mvalenci"	Though the design is cool, the quality of this earrings set is poor.

B000AR7S30:the_worst_thing_i_have_bought_from_amazon:charles_r._watson	I bought this thinking it would be a kind of sports watch - for swimming and running.  Unfortunately it is not waterproof for swimming, is unbelievably bulky, and has this strange time setting system which only works in the USA and Europe (I live in Australia). In the end I gave it to a relative in the USA	0

39273	The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers)	1
561836	I love knowing the exact time (even if my mom thinks I am crazy), and it works like a... clock! I never have issues with the updates (in Illinois), but I do have a few minor issues: the watch is too thick (5/8 inch), the band is made for a gorilla and is very difficult to adjust for a human, the buttons are hard to press, and the manual is too small and hard to read. Still, if I had a choice between this watch or my borhter's Rolex, I will take his Rolex and exchange it for 40 Casios. Thank you, Casio	1
B0000Z7MU6:great_but..........ouch!!:firejeep	I love the look and function of this watch BUT.....Guys if you have any hair on your wrists, be prepared to have it forcibly removed by the metal band.  I've had 3 other Fossil watches and never had this problem. I think Fossil needs to address the clearance between the links on this one. OUCH!	1
B0000B35GE:you_get_what_you_pay_for:nowicks	I sent these for my cousin (who has everything!)on her 16th Birthday.  When i saw them later they were smaller than I expected----but she wears them everyday and they look very cute and understated.  They are a nice color and look better than cheap silver ones.  Plus if you are like my cousin and your ears get irritated with anything but gold--I would recommend these	1

B000068YIJ:fabulous_bracelet!:	This quote became my all-time favorite the first time I read it.  I was so delighted to find it on a piece of jewelry!  I had it on my &quot;wish-list&quot; for over a year -- this year my husband finally took the hint and bought it for me!  It's a beautiful piece, is very comfortable and is made of quality silver.  I highly recommend it for anyone who finds herself needing a boost of self-reliance throughout the day	1

B0009EYJIG:product_matches_expectations;_no_problems:turret-index	Product matches expectations; no problems. Some other customers complained about how lightweight it is. To me it seems like what you should expect from titanium (after all, that's why they use it to make aircraft). The predictions of it getting sprung (losing its spring tension) were more of a legitimate concern to me, but I've had it for a month or two and it seems fine. It seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip, which is to say, maybe it eventually will, or maybe it won't, them's the risks of life. Go for it	1
B000BBH0TW:pristine:michael_hamilton	The necklace arrived quickly, especially considering that it came from Thailand.  Good quality, for a good price.  Thanks for good service.  Will be buying jewelry from this seller again	1
B000A3MM2G:good_:naveed_hyderi_"darkangel"	I read the reviews of the other buyers while I was purchasing ing this ring. The first review makes it sound mediocre while the other made it sound perfect. I promised myself I'd write a TRUE review of the ring once I recieved my own. The stone is neither large nor gawdy. The silver pattern is slighty thick for my tastes however not noticably thick. The stone is not high nor fake looking. The picture gives an acurate display of the product. All in all, it's a beautiful ring and a lovely buy for the price asked.	1
B000GFP28O:pirates_timepiece:purpleforfree_"carol"	This cute little watch comes with a real eye patch. My son loved it because he also wears an eye patch for his crossed eye	1

B0000AZ101:good_color,_nice_size:c._ceely_"cjcs"	I bought this as a holiday gift - they're a nice size, clear stones, with good purple color.  I'm very pleased with my purchase, particularly considering the price.  If I were to change one thing, I'd have preferred larger backs and a sturdier post	1
B000KPSA8E:my_husband_loves_it!:r._luckenbaugh	My husband likes watches and is a bit of a geek, so this was the perfect Christmas gift for him.  I was a little bit apprehensive when I recieved it but it works just like it should.  It is not apparent from the discription, but this watch does have the date feature.  I couldn't have gotten him a better gift for the price, he wears it every day	1
B0000C9ZBX:nice_watch_mister!:crabfan_"crabfan"	I've only had this watch for about a week, so can't really comment about the long term durability.  However, it is ultra cool watch.	1
B0000C9ZBX:very_thin_exquisite_watch,__amazon_price_is_half_of_macy's:n._s._phillips	I loved this watch the moment I put it on at Macy's.  I get home to see if I could maybe get a better deal than $135.  As always Amazon comes through yet again with a price of $69 plus I don't pay sales tax on it.  SOLD!  If you've not seen this watch in person the pictures definitely do not do it justice	1
B000N5UWLY:modest_and_honest:sean_d._tyler_"seanbo0"	This is a perfect anytime gift. I bought this for my gf for xmas and she loved it. We have only been dating for 6 months i did not want to get anything that was over the top.  Perfect for any occasion. She'll love it.	1
B0006O1H8E:perfect:jjh_sturtz_"zhensu"	I had the pendant in 3 days, insted of 3 weeks! And that from the US to the Netherlands. Many thanks for that. The Pendant itself is perfect, very detaild and it looks great.	1
B0000B35G6:perfect!:tina_m._salmieri	These earrings are perfect! Perfect in size, color and weight. They're not much bigger then a quater and very light, in a beautiful white gold shine. Yes the post are thicker then most, but after a few days you get use to them. I had a pair like these that were given to me as a gift and I lost one. When I found these on Amazon I wasn't sure how much they would be like my other. They are a perfect match and my old pair was at least 7-8 years old. If you want a perfect hoop that is good for day or night these are the ones	1
B0002TA1WG:christmas_gift:marion_l._lambert	I bought these for my sister for Christmas and she absolutlely loved them	1
B0007QR92O:loving_this_bracelet:sophia_o'brien_"stampingcrazy"	Although I've only had it a few weeks, I have had many compliments and questions on where I got it.  It is detailed and solid with a great message.  Would recommend it	1
B0000643Q6:perfect_watch!:l._mansell	I am the type of person who has to have a watch on; I feel lost without it.  Therefore, my watch has to be something that I can wear every day.  But I also wanted something that can go with a dressier outfit.  And this watch is wonderful.  I've heard that Skagen is a good brand and it's true.  It's very lightweight, beautiful (I love the little crystals at each number), and durable.  Great buy	1
B0000643Q6:nice_watch:e._chen	This watch is great, looks great and feels great. The hands clicking sound is almost none! Overall nice watch, very happy with it.	1
B0000X044E:fast_shipping:cindy_chen	I bought this watch for my bf on V-Day, I ordered it on 2/10 and the order was here online, fast shipping and item was in good shape. Will do business again in the future.	1
B0000TIIPA:if_you_are_in_the_medical_field,_buy_this_watch...:d._frank	even if you are not, buy this watch.  I am a nurse, much like many of the other reviewers.  In fact, I bought it due to their reviews.  It is a fantastic watch.  Easy to read, has an illumination option and a handy date feature.  The only trouble I have is the size of the band (too long).  I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out, however, the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy (it's not).  Don't even bother looking for another watch, this one is a steal	1
B0000643Q8:simple,_light,_and_stylish:d._kropp_"dex"	I bought this watch because I wanted something inexpensive, but still professional looking.  I like the lightness of the watch, the thin size, and the simple design.  It does make an audible ticking sound that is louder than I would like, but still not very noticeable.	1
B000FF8QXI:electronomicon:brandon_minniear_"electric_devil_machine"	this is a very nice, affordable watch.  i like not having to replace batteries and knowing that it will ALWAYS be accurate.	1
B00023K4FG:beautiful!!:lissa_leigh_"melissa"	Bought this beautiful necklace for my daughters b-day.  She loves it and now other family members want me to get one for them.	1
B000F8REDI:very_nice:r._d._martin	I recieved this watch for Christmas and I'm still blown away looking at it.  Had to take it to a jewelry shop to remove a link (my wrists are small) because the links are difficult to do themselves, but that's probably just for emphasis on quality.  It came in a Fossil christmas tin, very well packaged.  I'm very satisfied and recommend it for someone looking for a nice dress watch for their collection	1
B0006AAS5Q:lovely_watch:dre_"tech`"	Has the effect of thousends $$$$ watch. I love it. One of the best deals i`ve had from Amazon this last years	1
B000KUFJNI:good_bang_for_the_buck!:anthony_e._marquette	I read the reviews on this diamond just before Christmas when it was on sale for $99.00. The diamonds are better then expected and I consider them to be a fine purchase for 99 bucks. No visible flaws. I am sure if I used a loop I could find some but no visible yellow on these and the clarity is fair. Their great for $99.00 diamonds	1
B0009P665Y:great_watch:d._smith	The dial is big for some people, but being it's a diving watch I would expect nothing less.  This is a beautiful piece of machinery and I wear it everyday	1
B000H81DP6:very_nice_set:d._velagaleti_"dv"	I presented it to my sister's daughter and she loved it very much..She loved  cell phone , watch and even Box. I felt very happy and i would suggest any one to buy this item..	1
B000IQ9JQM:cute,_elegant!:rebecca_a._washburn_"pandora"	I love these!  They are such a good deal for the price, and come in a nice box.  They are much better than what I was expecting. : )  Colours are a nice pastel, and would go with lots of different things.  Pearls are large but not too large - just right	1
B000IQ9JQM:real_pearls.:j._hudson_"truth_seeker"	As with all natural pearls, the shapes are not perfect. Only cultured pearls are perfect, because man controls them. The dye is uniform and the size is perfect, big enough that they can be seen easily.  The colors; pink, white, gold, and lavender are clear.  Even the green is a clear green, just not my favorite green	1
B0009KNC7E:great_for_children:amazon_buyer	I gave this necklace to my daughter who was becoming a new big sister and she just loved it.  The necklace was very symbolic because the big heart represented Big Sister and the little heart represented little sister holding on.  I just loved it	1
B000EG47XQ:much_shinier_in_person:cc_mccool_"cc"	This pendant is much prettier in person.  It's got a nice polished finish, not satin/matte like in the image.  It hangs nicely on the sturdy snake chain.  I've already received several compliments on it.	1
B000BDDF30:outstanding!!!!:umpa_lumpa	I love this watch, I've had it for almost a year.  Its absolutely beautiful, but simple. It keeps time very well.  For the work I do I don't wear this watch to work.  So I can go sometimes a full week without wearing it.  The hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as I pick it back up and give it a shake, the hands spin around and sets itself.  Its not to dressy for casual wear, but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie. I highly recommend it!	1
B000KPWC0Q:excellent:c'est_moi_"whocaresanyway"	I bought two of these, one each for DH & DS and both have found it perfect, apart from having to remove a few links. (If you've got thick wrists, it is perfect indeed.	1
B0000X044O:stylish_watch_for_the_money:william_a._wilcox_"willywill41"	This is a great and stylish watch.  I always get compliments.  It is heavy, sturdy and looks much more expensive than what the actual price was.  It looks great with any suit and looks really good with a nice blue shirt.  Highly recommended.  The stainless steel is much shinnier than what the picture shows.  Ignore the comment below.  You will be happy with this watch!	1
B00023JOCA:love_these_earrings:j._brent	Had these on my wish list and received them as a gift. They are even more lovely in person. They are one of my favorite pairs - I wear them all the time. They're very simple, yet elegant, and very well made, especially for the price. I will definitely buy more from this company.	1
B0002C81BQ:great_buy:waymon_cox	I bought this set for part of my fiancee's Christmas, and she loves it!  The pearls are a very nice size.  They really are heavy and shine beautifully.  They are definitely worth the price	1

B000AXPUJ8:exquisite:jennifer_king	I received these earrings today and am delighted with them.  I read the reviews carefully, so I knew the actual size of this item, and the only surprise was how exquisite these little earrings are.  The presentation (bag and box) is beautiful -- looks like materials you would be given in a traditional jewelry store.  I've posted a couple photos in customer images so you can better visualize the size and see what the earrings are housed in	1

B0000B35DB:very_nice_earrings:k._frank	I ordered these earrings a little over two months ago and I am very happy with them. They are very light weight and they do not pull on your ears. The size is perfect; very "in" right now. You do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. However, so far, so good. They have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. I even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. They were completely fine afterward. I do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. But, overall I love my earrings	1
B0000VMCEQ:quality!:kathleen_m._klavon_"the_truth_is_out_there"	I wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son - and came upon this ring.  When it arrived, I really was in awe of just how beautiful it is!  It is a larger, more bold ring - definitely more masculine.  This is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love.	1

When I received it, I was impressed with the detail.  It is lovely and shines as only silver does, and I know I'll get big-time brownie points when she opens it on X-mas.  Also a great stocking-stuffer	1

B0000Z7MMO:best_watch_you_can_get!!!:	I bought this at a fossil store for $85, and its worth every cent. It has the time, day of week, date, and military time. Its waterproof up to 100 meters. It has a double lock to stay on your arm. It is glow in the dark. It has a spinning number thing. It looks good and is always shinny. its only 85 bucks. ITS PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
B000E4Z3YA:does_the_job,_plus_some:gregory_bell_"1_er_rn"	This is not the first tool I'ld add to my work bench, but it has some pieces I'm glad to have.  I re-sized my watch band in just a few minutes and only had one little incident with doing something the wrong way.  Did I mention that the instructions are somewhat lacking?  In hind-sight I should have figured it out before I made the mistake, but that's hind-sight for you.  If your good with working with tools, and you have a need to adjust a watchband at least every Christmas, then this is a good deal	1
B000FF5DCK:almost_everything_i_need_in_a_watch.:b._webb_jr._"bgwebb"	Keeps time very well(obviously).  No problems getting signal to sync with atomic clock.  Chrono, second time zone, all other functions work well.  Love the light function, better than any Indiglo I have owned.  Only quibble is that the alarm needs to be louder	1
B000FPKVSG:excellent_watch:tom_bennett_"bomber"	I just received this watch and I have to say it's very sharp looking not to mention has some weight to it. This is not a flimsy watch by any means. It's all stainless steel and the clasp is the easiest I have ever had to negotiate of all the watches I have gone through over the years. It's very secure lock yet simple to unclasp. I would recommend this watch to anyone. Also, it's dressy and casual ~ all purpose watch	1
B000E8UQKC:beautiful:susan	I love this pendant. Very shiny and substantial - the back looks as good as the front.  I also wear this on a black leather cord (16") and it gives it a whole new look.  Great buy	1

B0000B35EQ:very_pleased.:amber	The earrings are lovely especially given the bargain price.  They came in a nice box too, so if you want to give them as a gift they make a nice presentation.  Overall, couldn't beat this deal	1
B000JNS97Y:9_year_old_loves_this_watch:dylan's_dad	If your little guy or gal is struggling with telling time and is a Lego fan this is the best deal money can buy. Under $20 and is expandable etc. Probably not the most durable diver type watch you'll ever buy but it is really good looking, easy to assemble (it's a Lego) and all the kids think it's neat to boot	1
B0009EYJIQ:titanium_key_ring:erik_b._cass	The keyring is very nice.  I had no idea just how light titanium is.  The caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight, it's easy to see the caps coming unscrewed, making the ring kinda useless.  Definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it.	1
B000CHTYGM:beautiful_ring:melissa_fitch_"missy__ann"	I just bought this ring. It is really beautiful. It is a litttle bigger than i thought it would be but it fits good and was shipped quickly. It was a really good buy.	1
B00064C4Y0:gorgeous:mentally_unbalanced_"madginny666"	i love puzzle rings.  in england it's real difficult to find them	1
B0006IHHMK:seiko_coutura_watch:robert_s._burch_"write_way"	I like the stop watch functions that this watch has.  I also like the seperate dials for the different timekeeping functions.  Unfortunately, this watch is hard to read in bright light. Such as sunlight and well lit spaces.  Overall though, I like this watch because it looks good.  Well, it looks good on me anyway	1
B000LUVFA8:what_impact_for_such_a_reasonable_price:fairy_grandmother	Got this today, and can't stop looking at it.  It's beautiful.  All who have seen it want one.  I cant wait to try more of their jewelry	1
B00080HDYS:elegant_watch!:carolina_calmet_"caro"	I really like it it's an excellent watch and also a very elegant one	1
B000MNCH9W:pink_box:maple	The box is soft, and very durable. But it is a bit big.	1
B0000B35GL:stunning_value:susan_srite	These earrings are beautifully made, look great when put on, and come at a great price.  All these ingredients make a stunning value.  I am a very pleased customer.	1
B000EOMYWE:very_nice_watch_for_the_price.:alterosity_"jon"	This is a great choice for a business casual style watch. With it's crystal clear face and smooth shape, it complements most business attire nicely. The adjustment button doesn't get pulled easily, so there is less chance of accidental time loss. After several weeks of wear, still no scratches on the watchface, and the metal remains untarnished. I still get questions about it. Definitely an eye-catcher	1
B000099THB:it`s_good_:jonas_"f30"	is a nice clock,some people tall to me about the clock,the people say"is nice the clock"	1
B0006OJ72W:beautiful_ring,_fast_delivery:d._newton	This was a gift, and I was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping. I will definitely purchased from this seller again	1
B000IZAO4O:great_product:jimmie_d._thuma_"book_maven"	Outstanding service - product was as described and the price was fair - mailing in a timely manner was acceptable.  Will continue to shop for similar items via Amazon	1
B0000B35D8:beautiful:c._lehosky-hobel	Not much else o say, they look and wear awesome. The price is very good as well.  recommend these for anyone with pierced ears	1
B0000B35D8:gold_round_hoops:p._l._bliven	I am very small featured and these are the perfect size.  Light weight and very well made	1
B0006IHHN4:bullet-proof_value_with_style:david_ellis	I have owned both the black "Monster" with bracelet ( my daily work watch )and the orange with the rubber strap ( which I sold to an envious friend ).	1
B000ALB1N4:very_cute:mandy_"mandisita"	Very cute, price efficiant... Only problem is if the band gets wet, and you have sunscreen on, your arm will get tinted blue	1
B0007CZK6K:perfect_everyday_no_reason_gift:k_a_goode	These lovely little gems are perfect for those women who, like me, have a second or third ear piercing. Small enough to be dainty but large enough to be seen without being unnecessarily ostentatious.	1
B000IQ9JQ2:pretty_pearl_earrings:m._breach_"mbb"	I am really happy with this purchase!  The earrings came together in an attractive box (perfect as a gift, but I don't want to give them away).  They are nice and large on my earlobe and look great.  They are really soft to the touch and I like the colors too.	1
B000B6CSIU:one_happy_fiance!:k._mccrum_"golf_geek"	I bought these as a gift for my beautiful fiance for Christmas. At first she wasn't overly impressed, but when she put them on (to humour me) she found them very pretty, and unusual. The crystals really reflect the light, and she was extremely pleased with them	1
B000E4C8BG:sterling_silver_pendant:m._musaus	I love this piece!! It is a beautiful quality and design....It is lightweight and will look good with anything you wear.	1
B000EPLR2G:a_fine_precision_instrument:andy_apple	From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance.	1
B000ASYPTE:darling_charm_bracelet:maryann_johnson	My granddaughter loves this bracelet - I sent it as a surprise and she wore it to school the next day	1
B000DT8SY8:outstanding_auto_winder...:alfred_s._vulpis	This Garinin autowinder does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Keeps both my autos running and ready for use.  It is quiet, smooth, and looks pretty good sitting atop my computer desk.  It has a variety of settings that will meet the needs of almost any auto watch on the market.  It is well built, and works as described	1
B000A7G45I:good_tool_for_most_watches:david_k._kullman_"fred"	Once I got the hang of it it worked like a charm. I needed to mount a magnifying glass to the table so I could see for perfect alignment. If not perfectly aligned you break pins.  Now that I got the hang of it I have one pin left I keep e-maling seller to buy more pins but seller won't answer. Does anyone know where to get more pins? I would buy another unit but seller went to the bank on shipping charges	1
B00023K4Z6:christmas_gift:kimberly_price	I got this yesterday from my boyfriend and I love it. It's very pretty and I was extremely happy to unwrap it. =	1
B0002LB2TK:jet_steamer:r._boyd	The steamer works very, very well. Sure beats paying for, or even just the hassle of taking your stuff to the jeweler and wondering if you got back what you took in. Great gadget	1
B0000B35GD:positive:erica_(yani)	I loved the earrings, but unfortunatly one of them was faulty and had to send it back.  The package was lost in the transition but Amazon gave me a full refund and was very helpful.  The earrings were beautiful and of good quality	1
B000AHICUS:circle_pendant:phyllis_h._pajka	I came in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected.  The person that received it loved it	1
B000936JGC:solid_watch:james_r._mcmahon_"jimmy"	Happy with the purchase, the watch was what I expected.  Casual enough to wear to work or for a night ou on the town.	1
B0000C9ZBE:a_very_nice_watch:j._walsh_"jw"	I've had this watch for about nine months now. I wear it every day. It keeps great time and looks great as well. Many people have complimented me on the design of this watch and asked me who made it. The mesh band is the most comfortable and lightest band you will ever wear.	1
B000A7G45S:perfect_tool:andrew_root	I never adjusted a watch band before and I thought it was going to be difficult after reading the other reviews on the other watch tools. This tool could not have made it any easier, I didn't break any pins and I adjusted two watch bands the night it arrived with ease. You will need a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the watch pin completely out of the band. I adjusted an Accutron Lady's York and a Swiss Army Men's Maverick. I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head	1
B000066P6R:bottom_of_a_nuclear_silo:m._maxwell_"nuclear_film"	This watch was great. I really loved the digital feature residing in the analog face.	1
B000FIWCZ8:quiet...quiet.....quiet:jeanette_tamayo_"scarlet"	owned a different brand that was noisy and only worked for about a month......this winder i can not hear it run and have had it a couple of months....it is still running like clock work......would recommend to anyone that doesnt want to pay an arm and leg for one.....	1
B000B7W992:very_pretty:patricia_west	Although glass, they do look like opals, and have a lovely irridescent qualit	1
B000E8H0BU:really,_500_out_of_5_stars!:k._driskell	My son tells me that he loves his watch and would give it 500 out of 5 stars.  He saved up for it, and he bought it with his own money after his ADHD and Asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders).  He'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having.  It is a cool watch.  It looks good, it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far.  It is waterproof/or resistant, so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok.  This watch was a way that he could solve his own problems, and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties.  That's why I like it so much.	1
B000I0YYO0:wish_this_had_a_better_clasp.:susan	Zina makes wonderful jewelry and that is why I am frustrated that they use such a cheap chain for this pendant. The pendant itself is beautiful and the silver SHINES, but the garnet is very small.  It is a nice red color though. I purchased this on sale and that is why it gets four stars and not three.	1
B000A3Z6A6:great_item!_hard_to_find!:amanda_reid	I bought two of these (one for each daughter 3 & 6).  It is very hard to find sterling chains in the length needed for children. Thank you	1
B00020J16W:great_watch_and_great_seller!:christina_alioto_"maine-iac_in_nyc"	Thanks for the prompt delivery.  Great packaging.  A beautiful watch--sleek and chic.  Perfect size for everyday wear and more active wear.  Great features, easy to use.	1
B0000C9ZBW:love_it!:j._todd_white	The watch is super thin; you barely know you are wearing it.  In two weeks, I have had over 10 compliments	1
B000K2O09U:pretty_and_petite:d._he_"at_harvard"	My roommate got this for his girlfriend, and after examining his girlfriend's ears, I have decided that these earrings are great for the price. Not something you want to give your wife, but an excellent gift for a young boyfriend trying to impress his young (or old) girlfriend with an entry-level "nice" gift. They are a decent size, and no faults are noticeable at a normal distance. Recommended	1
B00070OX3S:good_looking_and_good_value:margarette_connor_"doc_c"	Because I teach, I wear a man's watch so I can keep my eye on the clock without seeming to look at my watch all the time.  This beauty has a very easy to read dial.  And it looks very cool and retro--I've gotten many compliments.  I should probably have the bracelet made smaller--it's one of the bigger-sized men's watches I've ever worn--so I think it would be a great choice for big guys.  I am quite pleased with my purchase.  The price was nice, too	1
B000792K52:great_value:jonathan_kelley_"vaxocentric"	This watch looks and feels great on me. Yes, I had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit, but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes (which included figuring out how to do it, which I'll explain at the end).	1
B0006IC09K:beautiful_ring:angela_"a_sappy_romantic"	I love this ring! It's interesting to look at, and I like the design. I haven't taken the string off for fear of not being able to figure out the puzzle. Maybe one day I might try it, but I like it so much I don't want to chance it now. Shipped fast	1
B0009EYJM2:great_bracelet!:robert_c._mitchell_"robert__mitchell"	This bracelet looks better than the picture.  It looks beautiful on my wrist. The fifty bucks that I paid for it was a real bargain. I love it. There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now	1
B0009P674O:great_watch_/_great_price_/_great_service:k._mcdonald	Beautiful Watch!! I was already familiar with Invicta and know that they're worth three times the price and that in the future they will be.  Had it in just a few days.  Don't let the picture fool you.  It does not do this piece justice and you would be better off going to another site to view what this watch actually looks like...looks like it cost a whole lot more.  I've been watching Invicta's for about a year now and if you find a better price than this...It's stolen!!!	1
B00020J17G:great!:sofia_serpas	This was a gift for my brother and he really enjoyed it.  It was shipped quickly which is always a plus	1
B00023JRTK:much_nicer_than_the_picture:pira	This is a beautiful piece of solid silver jewelry.  Well constructed and spins without burrs or sticking points.  It is very pretty, and a wonderful addition to my wardrobe. A lovely pendant that I will treasure always	1
B0000X03OA:beautiful,_sophistecated,_elegant_watch:ekta_sachan	I have been wearing this watch for last 6 months no complaints. Loved the Adjust-o-matic bracelet. Great buy	1

B000EOR0J6:simple,_elegant_and_relatively_inexpensive...:s._thomas_"nycollegekid"	This watch is definitely something that I will keep with me for a while.  It is simple, elegant, and came to me for relatively cheap.  The free shipping is always a bonus, and I also came across it in the Gold Box deals, and when I saw it I knew I had to have it.  It is pink and is lighter pink in the center.  The bracelet was large with the extra links, so I removed them and took it to the store to make it smaller. I think its a great watch for both casual and more formal settings	1
B000BDIQPM:an_excellent_watch_with_one_small_criticism:robert_derenthal_"bucherwurm"	My wife commented to me on the attractiveness of this watch, something she has never done before as she doesn't own a watch, and has no interest in them. It is a beautiful timepiece.	1
B000KPSACK:very_accurate_and_i_like_the_numbered_face:d._r_schryer	Atomic watches are highly-accurate quartz watches which are synchronized each day with a time signal broadcast in the U.S. from the definitive U.S. Atomic Clock in Ft. Collins, Colorado. Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times. If you want a numbered-face watch that is always accurate this model is a real bargain	1
B000KPSACK:atomic_watch:k4jdr_"ron"	I am completely satisfied with this product.  Correct time is kept and it has been a great watch.  I have had many atomic wrist watches and this is the best one ever.	1
B0002291U6:great_info_dial-_a_little_big_:mr._michael_a._johnston	I've had the watch for about 3 weeks and I really like it better than i expected	1
B000GB1R5U:big_watch:cc_rider_"cc"	This is a Big watch for the price!	1
B000K8E1NE:just_beatiful:ernest_l._campbell	These are so pretty, I'd like to have a whole box of them just to look at.	1
B0000C4E4Y:platinum_hoop_earrings:j._weigel	These small earrings are great! I can sleep in them and because they are platinum, I do not have any allergic reaction to the metal! I'm so glad I found them	1
B0000C9ZD1:this_watch_is_a_winner:c._king	I gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it. Can't lose with this one	1
B000AXZE8K:beautiful_&_classic:bibliophile_mom_"aimee"	This is a beautiful, classic piece.  My husband got mucho brownie points for this one.  A good choice for anyone you want to show your love to	1
B000FTO9OO:great_product_at_a_good_price:b._whiting_"bridgette"	I own about 27 various expensive brands of quartz watches and finally decided it was time to invest in an automatic. I knew stories from other people who own them and claim that it's important to have a good watch winder, so, I saw this one and decided I'd give it a try. I could not see the point in spending hundreds of dollars on a winder when I could use that money towards another watch! :)   I ordered this before I even received my new Invicta Automatic Pro Diver watch.	1
B000J1F9VK:beautiful_pendant:m._e._goll	I purchased this necklace as a Christmas gift for my sister. The pendant is very nice indeed, but the chain is poor quality and seems like it will break easily. With a replacement chain the necklace turned out very beautiful though	1
B0000C9ZCY:just_what_i_was_looking_for:t._weinstein_"big_researcher"	Lightweight, great price, self adjustable...this was the perfect gold toned watch for me!  I shopped around and Amazon had the best price for this watch	1
B000BTOW54:small,_one-sided_moon_pendant:eric_t._lan_"elan"	This pendant is small, about the size of a dime, and very light. It is one-sided - the opposite side is hollow. It appears exactly as shown. The chain it comes with is 18", which is pretty standard, and has a circular clasp with the knob you have to pull on	1
B0002Z85E6:beautiful,_lovely,_but_would_like_a_different_clasp:oregonchick_"staci"	The set is absolutely gorgeous in person, and I'm sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster. The clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design, and it's incredibly secure when fastened; however, it's difficult to maneuver and I can't imagine ever being able to put the necklace on - or get it off - without assistance. That's the only reason I wouldn't give this five stars - the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great	1
B00076TR5Q:grandpa:kenneth_b._charlish	I ordered for my Grand daughters Xmas present and she loves them...	1
B000B8UWT0:loving_it!:a._chericozzi_"lovelymarquise"	I was honestly expecting some cheap necklace that felt like plastic, considering the price.  I was so very wrong! The necklace is gorgeous! The clasp is sturdy and not easy broke.  Package it was mailed in was also very good. I am able to Christmas wrap it in the package provided.  Excellent service.  THANK YOU!!	1
B00020J0SQ:excelent:pucmm_frank_de_cruz	Hasta este momento ha sido una experiencia muy favorable, pues el reloj ha funcionado perfectamente y el tiempo de entrega estuvo dentro de mis expectativas.	1
B00068TK7U:very_nice:s._miller	This is a really nice looking watch. Keeps accurate time. Would recommend to anyone considering. Did a lot of research and Amazon had the best price with free shipping	1
B0000AZ10B:really_gorgeous:j._d._sullivan_"jennifer_s001"	These earrings are a gift for the upcoming holidays.  I think the person receiving them will really like them.	1
B000B43QI8:outstanding!:deborah_macgillivray_"author,__a_restless_knight;_the_invasion_of_falgannon_isle;_in_her_bed"	I received this off my wish list from a dear friend and I must say, it's stunning.  It's both delicate and sturdy.  The craftsman's shift is beautiful, in what you would expect a piece to cost four times this amount.  The stone is beautiful and large, without being gaudy.	1
B000F7DJJM:beautiful_earrings!:donna_ashley_"problemchildsmom"	I bought these earrings as a birthday present.  They are very pretty.  I am pleased with the quality and the price	1
B00080Q2M2:beautiful_earrings:tim	They are small, but sparkly and look very cute.  My 15 year old loves it, and wear it every day	1
B000K2H1L4:nice_for_everyday:fdlewis	I found this pair of studs to be nice for everyday wear.    They look much better than the ones found in Macy's fine jewelry and they cost less.  Personally I would not go over 1/3 ctw with this quality because the flaws would become obvious.  I am very satisfied with my purchase	1
B00068TK84:good_watch_for_the_price.:adgorman	My husband has really liked this watch so far.  The price was great for such a elegant looking watch.  He wears it when he dresses up.  He really likes that it is Kinetic.  We don't have to worry about replacing the battery.  The last watch I bought him was a fossil and we had to send it to their servicing center when the battery died and had to wait 4-6 weeks.  The kinetic seems to be working out great	1
B00023K5GY:rubber_cord_necklace:l._jackson	Item came to me fast.  It is very confortable and very reliable.  I don't have to worry a regular chain sticking in my neck or pulling my hair when the necklace moves. I highly recommend this necklace for sensitive skins or active people	1
B000BIWRPW:kiddies:tania_parker_"dart_champ"	my son needs a watch and this is ideal for him its cheap and it non breakable	1
B0009P66Y0:big_watch:captainvideo	I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so.	1
B0006OATG0:love_it!:t._misenas	I read the reviews for these earrings and I am very pleased with the results.  I purchased my own pair and get plenty of compliments too	1
B000B0MYV2:nice_for_the_price:james_p._witherell_"hockeyjimm"	Saw the exact same watch in several jewelry case around town for $125 more. Very satisfied with my purchase	1
B00064UULY:nice:yael_j._horowitz_"mother_may_i"	for the price.  It is well made and solid.  Perfect for my kids	1
B000FF5DDY:solar_atomic_watch:michael_l._freels	This watch arrived very quickly, and it is a very fine watch.  I had an earlier Casio Ceptor watch and the battery died, I couldn't find anyone to replace it so I needed a new watch.  By the time I had ordered this watch, I actually replaced the battery myself in the old one.  So now I have two atomic watches, but the G-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power, just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge.  A great deal	1
B000B545BO:my_second_ironman_watch:mountainmom	I'm ;logged in on my wife's accont. I never had problems with the band. I liked the first one so much that after I ran over it with my car, I ordered another. If you think of it as a throw away watch and keep it for two years, you'll love it. It has a very intuitive design, is lightweight and just works	1
B000K2IJVA:tiny_but_nice!:p._r._foltz_"thrasymacus"	I went out on a limb and decided to surprise my wife with these for Valentine's day.  I purchased the white gold version for her, and to my great astonishment, my wife was pleased by my jewelry choice - a first!	1
B00074KYC8:another_excellent_eco-drive!:slider_"slider666"	This is my fourth (a fifth, limited-edition is on order) Eco-Drive. I collect a lot of watches but these are some of my favs to actually wear and use. They are the most accurate watches I've ever owned, bar-none.  The Nighthawk is solid, well made, and a delight to wear.  There are few watches on which I'd change nothing, but this is one.  I also got an excellent price and great service.  Many thanks	1
B00014ACLC:big_nice_watch:vanessa_medina	This watch is gorgeus, it's a very big watch (it doesn't look so big on the picture), the screen can be set to black or red, looks good either way. Very confortable	1
B0000UIUNE:good_watch._perfect_for_small_wrist.:trader3	I always wear timex and never have  a problem	1
B0000C6BO3:very_nice_earrings:d._money	I very much like these earrings.  My only reason for not giving them a 5-star rating is that the topaz is quite small.  You really have to look closely to see it.  But, they are excellent quality sterling silver and still beautiful.  I recommend them, just be aware that the stones are tiny	1
B000J468P8:great_for_2nd_or_3rd_hole:bluecuervo	Bought these as a Christmas gift, and think think they are adorable! Great for a second or third hole to add a splash of color. Possibly perfect for a young daughter's first hole. The stones have a very nice sparkle. Wasn't sure if 3mm would be too small, but I think these will do just fine. This set came individually boxed but in a clear plastic holder so that you can easily give as a set, or break them up for individual wrapping. For $49, I'm very satisfied	1
B0006NX1XE:pretty_for_a_decent_price:i._manzanares_"nm_ninja"	I thought this was a very pretty lil keepsake.  I think simple is very nice, and it's simple in design and what not.  Plus it's not too expensive and as a "thoughtful" gift it will win lots of points	1
B00023JON4:silver_chain_review:christopher_d._fraga	This is a nice chain with a durable lobster claw clasp. The diameter is somewhat small, but I will probably order another chain with a larger diameter	1
B000EER0EQ:great_watch!:andrew_d._flowers	I've owned this model for about seven years and I think I'll buy another to keep on standby in case I break the original (I'm not gentle with my watches while working/playing).	1
B0009OP1OW:pretty!:jillie_"watchwatcher"	This is a real nice-looking box. I'm expecting great leaps in organization for all my wrist wear. Tech Swiss also receives an A+ for getting this out to me so swiftly	1

B00076VRT0:stunningly_simple:jacqueline_murphy_"vmsmom"	needed a gift for my mother in law who has everything; including great taste.  she collecgts the swarovski figures but didnt have any of their jewelry.  i came upon this accidentaly and took a chance on ordering it.  it arrived promptly; in time for Christmas; and it is very stunning.  not gaudy at all; just classic style beauty.  could probably be worn to her office each day (upscale casual) or if she is dressed up.   the price absolutely could not be beaten for what you are getting.  i liked it so much i wanted to get one for myself; and i am not a huge jewelry fan	1
B00023K9C4:great_quality:michael_picagli	I love the workmanship in this piece. Nicely done, and Silver Insanity has Awesome customer service	1
B00068TJ30:nice_watch:lizrdb_"lizrdb"	This watch is very rich looking.  The price was phenomenal!  I saw this for sale at other retailers for $300.00 plus!  I have received numerous compliments	1
B000AHICUI:vine_pendant:ver	I just received this today.  Somehow I completely missed that the pendant is on a silver-wrapped wire and not a chain.  Had I noticed that, I probably would not have ordered this piece - and I would have missed out.  It is very nice.  It has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but substantial.  The wire lays on my neckline just right, and the pendant looks beautiful. I'm very pleased with it.	1

B000NLRGWG:diamond_earrings:linda_s._boyd	These are so danty and comfortable to wear.  Was an excellent price as well.  Thanks for the offer	1
B000792JYE:nice_looking_watch,_digital_window_too_small:paul_h._vanderklay_"paulvk"	I've been through generations of digital watches with plastic bands. My wife thinks they look nerdy but I like the alarm and other gadgets. I'm tired of wearing these things out though and wanted something that looked nicer. This is a very nice looking, sturdy watch which was what I wanted. It also has the window with the digital time, date, alarm, etc. My only complaint is that that window is tiny and not easy to see. Also the light for night viewing is wimpy. The watch works fine and is very nice looking but I wish the window were a bit larger.	1
B000E8F2TM:glad_i_bought_it_on_amazon:m._j._rubinstein	I bought this watch on Amazon for my husband, who is an avid runner, and he LOVES IT !!  He sometimes has difficulty with the heart rate while running because of sweat (so he says) but otherwise no complaints (and he can be a tough critic)	1
B0009P66YK:beautiful,_practical,_and_durable:henry_h._knapp_"emotional_intelligence"	Are you tired of replacing watch batteries?  Do you bump into things with your watch?  If so, buy this one.  It's a beautiful, practical watch that's available at a very good price.  It winds itself mechanically as you move your wrist about.  No batteries.  It's shock- and water-resistant.  Bang it around, swim with it, wash dishes with it, shower with it.  No problem.  It's gold-plated stainless steel, with a gold-plated stainless steel band.  It's beautiful.  It's big, so if you have small wrists, buy the ladies version,  If not, buy the men's version.	1
B000GXCYFU:excellent_item,_she_loved_it:brandon_peery	Great item, don't go looking for huge diamonds, but it looked good over all.  And my girlfriend loved it so I guess that's the most important thing	1
B000EQRYMM:great_watch_but_it_could_have_been_better:o._obi	I got this watch some couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. It looks,feels and functions really good and got lots of positive comments from my peeps. Now for the reason i cant get give it a 5-Star (i really wish i could); IT DOES NOT HAVE PERPETUAL CALENDER. i was looking for a watch with all of the 2100 qualities and also with perpetual calender. I hate the fact that i have to manually adjust my watch and painfull enuf, i have to leave with this flaw.	1
B0000B35FY:beautiful:jose_roberto_magana	This was a gift and was lovely and beautiful. Not too big, not to small. Delivery time was great. Strongly advice to buy this	1
B0001ITXM2:great_watch_to_own:mila_murray_"mila_murray"	This was my first fossil watch I usually buy Burberry or D&G, but I was so hard for me to tell time on the watches so my friend told me to buy a fossil, so I did and I love it is so stylish and cute. I love the way it changes color from different angles	1
B000HAUP44:much_more_attractive_than_in_the_picture:kaneonapua_"the_dog_lady"	A nice moderately priced chain that is very pretty. It is fine, delicate chain and the serpentine pattern has a spiral look to it. The are reflective areas that shimmer every 1/4 inch or so. I am using with a large cubic zirconia pendant and it is quite stunning. The chain feels strong and less likely to tangle. Great purchase for the price	1
B000BF0XWE:great_watch:r._wollenstein	The watch is actually better than it appeared from the photo.  One of the few times when I can actually state that something is an even better value than it appeared	1
B000AMY252:as_advertised:c._mackel	First of all,I recieved the item in a very timely fashion..Approx 3 days..Second the packaging was very nice..The chain was a good quality snake chain and the pendent was a very good quality..Heavy and prettier in person	1
B00020J16M:perfect_for_swim_workouts_and_aquathlon_races:ocean_swimmer_"multi_sport_endurance_athlete"	I love this watch. It's perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races -- takes splits, can do intervals, etc. I use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs, but can't use it for my swims (since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water, and also, the unit itself is not waterproof). This Timex has an audible chime under water, and it's easy to set the various functions. It stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout. I also love the 3 alarms - my schedule is different every day, so I use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school, when to leave to pick up my son, etc. I had lost my first watch (same model), but never found another watch that had all the features I wanted for a reasonable price. This is my second one!	1
B00029U2IO:too_small_for_me__:-(:jk8	I ordered these earrings knowing they would be small.  If my ear holes had been a bit more toward the edge of my earlobe they might have fit.  These earrings are *really tiny* and do not fit me.  I need the next higher up size. These are like 3/8 inch, way small for me and also way difficult to even bend/manipulate to open the hoop	1
B00023K85C:my_favorite_earrings:d._smith_"sweethome"	These are my favorite earrings: I wear them constantly. They are unique and jazz up even the most utilitarian outfit. They are a bit larger than you might anticipate,and it is a size I really like but which might overpower some. The picture, at least on my monitor, is about life-sized	1
B0007X9F74:gorgeous_watch:jessica_peters_"jess"	the band and face are both SO MUCH darker than they look in the picture.  also, amazon neglected to send the owners manual and warranty information (I had to contact Skagen for this).  the watch is very attractive though	1
B0007IR4U4:best_watch_i've_ever_had:ihatesony	My girlfriend bought me this watch. Its design is great, and what's better, it's super light (titanium hooray!!). I think no country other than Japan can produce this kind of watch. Citizen, you rock	1

B0009ALML2:larger_than_life:beck_"-_beck"	They were quite a bit larger than I expected, I don't recall if they listed a size on the page.  But I am 100% pleased with the many other purchases I've made with Silver Insanity.	1
B0000C9ZBZ:slim_and_catchy:himanshu_parmar	this is the best watch if you consider following things:	1
B000FRP9WM:nice:cristi	this watch has it all at a nice price, the display is kind of dark and the band sacrifices some of your hand-hair if u have and i doubt that u don't have, else is a masterpiece, all stainless steel, even base, thermomener and a smart cronograph, plus 3 yrs battery, this is my favourite, no other watch has this price/quality proportion. try it and u will be satisfied, sporty but looks elegant too	1
B000FIJQI4:simply._._._beautiful!_:elizabeth_munoz_"...love_is_digital...baby_-bjork-"	I purchased this Bulova watch as a Christmans gift for myself, this past christmas '06. I have a small watch collection & I hadn't really bought such an elegant watch before, so I decided why not? Specially when I researched the price on how much I would save by buying it on Amazon.  By looking at the pics on Amazon it looked so nice, but when I received it  was the most BEAUTIFUL watch I had seen or owned. The diamond bezel is just right it isn't to much glitz nor is it too little, the diamonds are just right & amazing they sparkle so beautifully against the chronograph face & the stainless steel band. The watch itself is a little heavy compared to other watches I own so it is definitely sturdy & above all just a well made timepiece that I am sure will be, not just in my collection but on my wrist for years to come.	1
B000EG6FZY:great_value:blue_mom	I am very pleased with these earrings.  They are a great quality at this price.  I would also recommend the matching pendant.  Great set!	1
B0009Z0T20:tanzanite_toe_ring:gail_conway	Beautiful.  Wear them all the time.  Sincerely,  Gai	1
B0001HIT1Y:nice_watch_for_the_price.:c._johnson	A very nice watch for the price.  Very low profile and nice flexible band.  Would like smaller face but otherwise a great watch	1
B000E4ARE6:great_purchase:peggy_rodabaugh	we sent this necklace to our daughter. It arrived actually earlier than anticipated and she just loves it. What a great company to deal wit	1
B000B3MF0E:timex_marathon_indiglo_stopwatch:mr._brian_a._clements	I selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature, and I need to operate in subdued lighting.	1
B000AR7S30:waveceptor_atomic_watch_by_casio:d._parks	An awesome watch. I absolutely love it. Incredible value at this price	1
B000GHRBAY:wonderful:kkp	These earrings looked better than I expected.  They sparkle on my daughter's ears.  Very pretty	1
B00020J1JE:nice_under_$20_watch:ivaylo_v._ninov	I ordered one of these for the time I spend in the gym and on the track running, also it is a good choice if you go swimming every once in a while.	1
B0006IHHMU:nice_buy:t	Bought this to use at work since I had to send in the one I usually wear for repairs. Lumi is extremely bright when charged. The Monster has gained 1 minute in 2 days which is not bad for an inexpensive Seiko. Swapped the band with a NATO, fits a little bit better on my wrist. Overall a good purchase	1
B000BD3T7M:as_beautiful_as_the_photo_shows!:kathy_engelhard	Beautiful & deep blue round crystal post earrings.  I love them	1
B0009EYJKE:muy_hermosa_y_elegante:carlos_bustamante	Este es un lindo producto, hermoso y elegante, pero se raya muy facil. Igual me gusta y lo uso todos los dias, pero no creo que sea algo de muy larga duracion	1
B00023K8NE:they_are_as_pretty/prettier_in_person!:melissa_kitty_:)_"melissa_kitty_:)"	These earrings are very pretty. They are a nice size and they aren't heavy at all, very lightweight. I have had them for a week or so now and have gotten nothing but compliments on them. They are great and so is the price! The vendor sent them very promptly and there were no problems.	1
16749	Clock is smaller than I thought, and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall.  Made of cheap materials, definitely not worth $25	0
99944	I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a "20 inch" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!	0
110067	One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.	0
260864	If you are looking for something with great sound quality or even great accuracy in measurment, this isn't for you. The radio is hard to use since it doesn't have any indication of what frequency you are on, and every time you move it gets overwhelmed by static. The pedometer function is marginal at best. But its what you would expect for $15.	0
377937	I baked six loaves in this machine.  I have been using various bread machines for the past 12 years and feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right.  My big complaint with this machine is the low baking temperatures.  Even on the darkest crust setting and the longest baking time (70 minutes), my loaves were only marginally acceptable - they were not sufficiently baked.  I was using a nearly-whole wheat recipe.  The machine was quiet, strong, and had a lot of bells and whistles, but with only partially baked bread, I had to return it to Amazon.  Amazon shipped it to me in a very poorly packed box which was gaping open when it arrived, but they included return labels which made it a cinch to send back, and were quick enough with the refund	0
502288	I have ordered this unit twice this past month, the first one did not work properly in one of the units, the signal was distorted. After returning it to the supplier, I ordered it again from another Amazon supplier and one of the units did not work at all. I will now look for another brand	0
598356	Being somewhat of an insomniac I read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me.  I therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight.  If you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons.  Firstly, there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly.  Secondly, when using batteries, they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries.  This light is also extremely fragile.  Over a couple of years I went through 7 of these!  I would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply, and the constant new purchases after it breaks, you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light. I now have the Tri Lite by Capstone Enterprises (available at Barnes & Nobel - come on and get it in stock Amazon!)  It is terrific!  It has a clock with an alarm and a timer.  You can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes.  At that time you can extend the minutes.  If you don't do so, for example you're sleeping, it will automatically shut off.  It also produces much more light and is much brighter than the Itty Bitty Book Light	0
B0000635XM:quality_is_less_than_i_expect_from_kitchenaid:d._hayes	This toaster is more a decoration than anything else. My kids eat a lot of bagels & frozen waffles, and this machine just doesn't do the job without multiple toasting cycles. Even regular bread comes out barely toasted on one cycle. I also had the plastic prongs that hold the crumb tray in place, break off. (How?? it just sits on the counter, no one is playing football with it!) I feel that I wasted $50.00 on this- save your money	0
B000A8J3EQ:pump_doesn't_last:pooped_out_mommy_"pooped_out_mommy"	For what this item costs you would think that the pump would last longer than 3 months.  I really like foaming soap because I have three young children who have a tendency of making a huge mess with both bar and liquid soap.  Since there is so little actual soap in foam soap there isn't the big mess to clean.  But I have a fundamental problem with paying for bottles of diluted soap.  I searched high and low for an attractive foaming soap dispenser and Cuisipro was about all I could find.  But within 3 months the pump started to stick and I have to manually move it up and down.  It's cheaper to keep refilling the store bought soap dispensers and just buy a new one when it starts to stick.	0
B0002EXVJG:it's_dead,_jim:steven_e._field	I have had this scale for about 4 months.  It worked fine the few times I used it, but last night I went to use it and it has given up the ghost.  I swapped batteries and still nothing.  The connection for the 9v battery is VERY loose, and even after crimping and holding it tight it didn't get any juice.  Not happy so I will order a different brand and hope it does better.  I do not abuse or heavily use my kitchen gadgets, so maybe I just got a lemon	0
B0009XHEA2:damaged:ralph_harris	I really like the look of this bread bin, but the manufacturer does not package it in a box.  It only has a clear plastic bag around it.  Even though Amazon uses it's own box for shipping, it arrived with dents and cracks.  Amazon quickly replaced it with another one, which had dents, cracks, and the entire bottom was was badly scratched.  I don't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which isn't damaged, so I gave up after returning the second one	0
B000AB9LSG:lousy:gordon_dayton	the electric skillet takes forever to heat up and it does not heat in the corners also it takes longer to cook than an electric  frying pan I would not recommend this product.  thank yo	0
B00080Q2QI:seal_leaves_a_lot_to_be_desired:vtbonita	I bought these because they matched my dishes.  I really wish I'd kept my old ones, even though they were black.  The size of these is nice for flour, sugar, etc.; however, the rubber seals in them aren't great.  The seal on my flour (biggest one) falls in every single time I take the lid off.  They're pretty, but not very functional	0
B00022NGFW:loses_suction:rarely_write_reviewss	While this vacuum is easy to use, it loses suction after only 6 months. Don't buy this to waste money.	0
B00008V40B:hate_it!:holly_butler	I can't believe I spent good money on this vacuum.  I've had to open it with a screw driver countless times to try to figure out a myriad of problems: why it won't vacuum without pushing it with all my might, why it makes an awful noise that terrifies my children, why the filter won't stay in place, and why it SMELLS LIKE BURNED RUBBER every time am forced to use it.  I have replaced every filter and belt.  Now I am going to throw it away.  I'd gladly give it to charity, but I can't in good conscience give it to an unsuspecting victim	0
B00063RXLA:wrong_size:j._rusk	This item is not nine inches wide.  It is the same width as the seven stick cornstick pan, but costs ten dollars more.  So you are paying ten dollars to get two extra cornstick molds of the same size.  Hopefully, the item description will be changed soon.  Now, I have to pack up and ship back several of these, but at least Amazon is paying the freight.  Lodge Logic is the greatest for cooking and baking though.  I think this is just a random error.  Just be sure and buy the seven stick pan for 7.99.  The cornsticks will be the same size	0
B0007U01P2:i_bought_two!!_aughhh!!!:julia_marr	It looked like such a good idea on TV but that's the thing about TV. They didn't fit well on my stove at all and I couldn't even put my other stock pots on my back burners at the same time. Also the bottom scratched after a couple uses!	0
B0002AQQ56:better_than_nothing_._._._:anonymous_"cat_enthusiast"	If I had to do it over again I would try a different mat (something larger made of soft foam rather than hard plastic)	0
B00005KIDR:don't_buy!_doesn't_work_well!:k._sin	When we first bought it, it worked nicely and smoothly. Thought we do not need to buy another opener again. Boy were we wrong! After the third use, it will open only a small gap and the handle will just keep spinning. Reminds me of a car turning it's wheels will all smoke and noise but no results. Glad we still kept our old opener from a much lesser known brand. This opener certainly does damage to the KitchenAid name	0
B000FIIXLA:crack_casing!!!:bev.	Yes. I opened immediately when UPS delivered the window fan and it got a severe crack casing!!Got to return to Target minus off my shipping charges! Sad	0
B00008J4C8:defective_trigger:martha_sterling_ray	Do not buy the Shark Portable Steamer under any circumstances.  The trigger mechanism is defective and fails after a few uses, causing all of the steam to leak out uncontrollably, which is also exposes the user to a possible steam burn.  Euro-Pro Operating LLC does not stand behind its products.  They will not sell you a replacement trigger or hose assembly if it fails (and trust me, it will fail).  Instead, Euro-Pro wants you to spend $40 ($12.95 shipping + $27.00 "minimum" repair charge) to even look at it.  Replacement parts are an additional charge!  I can buy a competing product for the cost of Euro-Pro's "minimum repair" charge, shipping charge, + parts charge.  Euro-Pro's service after the sale stinks. I will not buy Shark Products or do business with Euro-Pro Operating LLC ever again.	0
B00005B5Z0:saucepan_made_in_indonesia_:h._moon	Saucepan made in Indonesia was extremely lightweight and pan was distorted so that the lid did not fit securely.  There was no way to realign the pan so the lid would fit.  It was in the construction of the pan.  As a long time user of Revere Ware, we were very disappointed in this product sent to us.  We will never purchase another Revere Ware product.  Once burned we will not go back to a second treatment	0
B000063CBY:was_grand_for_a_very_short_time:"meri-beth"	This item, affectionately named R2D2, worked like a champ with all the bells and whistles, well, actually lights and dials for about 5 weeks and then just stopped. ... Thus I'm profoundly disappointed - and now without any grinder. In fact, given its short life, the 2 star rating is incredibly generous	0
B0002XGM7A:form_over_function:j._lanham	I bought this blender based on the reviews here, as well as its great-looking design.  When I got the blender, only one of those factors came through.	0
B000BGKDXC:keep_shopping:d._howell	I have owned this blanket for less than a month so I cannot make any judgment about its longterm durability, but the first (and only) time it was washed it shed like a buffalo in springtime, and the dye used on the "moss" green was not colorfast in warm water and detergent.  I gave it two stars because it is reasonably warm, and has an attractive weave	0
B00076NPDG:no_good_:chris_prone	I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it.  Well that chance did not pay off.

B0000860FJ:not_great_for_electric:s._keck_"sassterbond"	I bought this hoping to wow my family with some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great on my electric stove.  If you leave it up too high for longer than a minute on the grill side the griddle coating burns off and stinks up the place.  If you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks.  I end up putting on high for a few minutes and then back down.  Doesn't cook thick meat for chicken breast through well.  You are better off finishing them in a real pan in the oven.  The coating chips easily.  I am thinking of going with cast iron as it is more work in the begining but I think it worth it in the long run	0
B000FTM5IQ:caveat_emptor:the_designer	This was a special offer and the price seemed excellent. Description stated "Standard Classic White Goose Down Feather Pillow". A more accurate description would have been "Mostly Feather Pillow with Some Goose Down, Skimpily Filled". I would have purchased better quality had the description been more accurate; i.e. larger quantity is listed first with additional quantities listed in descending order. Vendor should have precisely listed percentage of feather to down content, as they did with other catalog items. I believe they kept description fuzzy leading one to believe it was a fantastic offer rather than what it was. Caveat emptor	0
B0002I7ALW:piece_of_junk!:freddy_"fred"	This fountain is a piece of junk.  I ordered three of them, and all three had cracks and holes in the top piece.  The top piece is a molded resin that is very thin in places.  The thin regions easily crack, making it unsightly, interfering with the performance, and within days rendering the fountain unusable.  I was very disappointed and ended up buying an entirely different fountain	0
B00005QTXL:better_off_with_paper_filters_:mr	Don't buy this product.  It was ill-fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with.  I returned mine and went with paper filters, which work so much better and are cleaner	0
B0000VLMU6:don't_waste_your_money....:ellen_jorth	I've owned one of these for about a month.  It's a total waste of money.  It rarely sprays, just a steady stream of oil.  I'm diabetic and thought this would be a good way to restrict my use of oil on salads, etc.  I am so very disappointed......   I'll try to find another brand that is more reliable and that does what it's advertised	0
B0009PU91G:very_poor_quality:k._conner	I have used Wamsutta for years and have always been pleased with their quality and softness.  But I sincerely regret having bought these sheets.  I purchased one set, and, after the 2nd wash, there was enough pilling that they were uncomfortable to sleep on (all the little "balls" felt scratchy).  My husband asked me why we were using the "old" sheets instead of the new ones because they looked so worn!  I was so suprised that I called Wamsutta directly, and the very nice lady there assured me that I must have gotten a defective set, because that simply "doesn't happen with their sheets".  So I exchanged them with an identical pair.  And the end of the story is that I am returning this set for a refund because it is doing the exact same thing.  What a disappointment.  Absolutely do not recommend, and am now very wary of all Wamsutta products	0
B00004SACI:deluxe?_try_"cheap":kenny_o.	I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it.  The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose).  Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.	0
B000095SEK:i_should_have_spent_a_bit_more_to_get_a_better_one!:"babybsmom"	Not too happy with this small pizza stone--before I ordered this one for a long time I had a set of flat bricks in my oven that were made for pizza baking and bread baking.  I couldnt find these bricks again--I had them for a long time and they were cracked and hard to clean by now BUT they were so much better than this small round stone!  My bricks made my pizza crust so crispy--and this stone is a poor substitute for this!  My bricks were square and made a beautiful large square on my shelf--if anyone knows what I am writing about--PLS email me and let me know where these set of bricks can be found and their name!  I am not happy with this pizza set-the rack is of no use--the pizza cutter is a cheap one--they really should put the money into making a better product than giving extras	0
B0001CKS22:yeah_not_so_much...:g._augustine_"misplaced_expatriate"	Washed them once (before using) and now they look really old. They have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them.  I am not impressed. Would not buy again	0
B00020BP2U:supersized:a._antenucci_"winebuyer"	I bought these because I was looking for nice red glass.  I'm almost embarrassed at the size of them.  They are not practical but i paid so little it wasn't worth sending them back.  I recently saw them in Bloomingdale's so maybe this is the new trend but they won't do anything for your wine.	0
B000FRXHRQ:deceptive_photo:mark_a._jaehne	I thought I was getting a SET of forks NOT one fork. The picture and description are deceptive. The picture depicts a set(s) I am sure the ONE fork I got is great but I have 5 other hands that need a fork as well	0
B000BUQMZ6:don't_buy_refurbished:r._snow_"becca"	We had previously bought this same coffee maker new and liked it so much that we wore it out.  When I saw the refurbished for $20.00 I thought it was a great deal.  It would have been if it had come with all the parts and didn't leak!!  It didn't come with seals or with the water purifier.  I tried everything including new seals (that I bought separately).  Eventually we just went out and purchased a new one, because we still like the model.	0

B00004SBJ3:they_rust!__big_disappointment...:m._seddon_"green_thumb"	I have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best.  Only problem is that they RUST!!!  I had mine a few weeks when I noticed the rust spots on the interior.  I don't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot, so it must have happened simply because I leave water in my tea kettle at all times.  The directions that come with this kettle say not to do so, but any serious tea drinker like me knows that's unrealistic.	0

B000A7NN4I:can_not_replace_battery:martin_thurn_"kingpin"	We've had this for about five years.  The battery went dead but THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THE BATTERY.  The battery is soldered to the circuit board!  They expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $20 each way!  I opened it up, cut out the old battery, and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months.  Cooks rice great, though	0
B00004W4UQ:nordic_ware_microwave_cover.:gregory_marshall	This is not a good product -- it is not a very flixible plastic and breaks easily if dropped or flexed.

The product wouldn't even turn on, much less work. The packaging indicated it had passed Qulaity Control. whatever that means This was a Christmas gift that totally flopped. The Euro-Pro was one of the more expensive deep fryers in the store and I assumed the price was equal to the quality, boy was I wrong. If you're purchasing a deep fryer please stick to the name brands. This will be exchanged tomorrow and not for another Euro-Pro. Too bad because my 16 year old was looking forward to Deepfried Japanese dumplings for Christmas. A real disappointmen	0

B0008JIW8U:nice_idea,_but_disappointing!!:gingerpeach123	I received this model as a gift and thought it would be great since we only brew a few cups at a time. However, as other reviewers noted, almost immediately the clock started losing several minutes every day. I wasn't intending to use the delay feature very often so I didn't bother to return it. Now, just short of a year after I received it, it suddenly started working, so I'm shopping for a replacement. I might try another Mr. Coffee model with better reviews, but not this one	0
B00008SJXQ:lg_should_be_ashamed:mark_l._perilman	My wife bought this one from Best Buy without me reviewing it 1st. Amazingly, I would have bought it after reading the reviews here. I'm starting to wonder who writes these things ... LG employees? The microwave is fine - no complaints. The toaster, however, is an unmitigated disaster. I am of the opinion that you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance is a poster child for this thought. The toaster browns extremely unevenly and inconsistently (sometimes you should toast the same piece of bread on 5 and sometimes as high as 10!). More importantly, the toaster broke after 31 days (coincidently the Best Buy return policy ends at the same time - Best Buy has an unacceptable return policy but with a guy named "Ricky" managing the store what can you expect?). LG picks up the phone quickly and they honor the warranty. The problem is they can't think outside of the box. They had me get it repaired but I have to inconveniently drive it out there and pick it up - OK ... no problem. One day later? It breaks again. It is an extremely poorly built appliance and the repair people thought they had fixed it and had not. That's how bad it was. LG will not budge - have it repaired again (great option - costs LG money, me more travel time, and it won't do the job) or do a rebate. The rebate requires me to buy another LG or Goldstar product. Huh? So you create a shoddy product and rush it to the marketplace (they admitted they don't have a detailed enough repair history because it is too new) and then don't stand behind your product. You backend me into another LG or Goldstar product that I would not have otherwise bought. How does our government allow these atrocious foreign companies to business here? Our we so bad as a manufacturer that we can't top this? Their supervisors were very hardlined and there was no getting around this. "You can cal Korea but they won't change their policy" they said. I will never willingly buy another LG or Goldstar product and I highly recommend you do the same. Shame on you LG - you could have had me as an appliance buyer for the next 50 years and now your name is mud to me	0

B00004RHRM:not_all_it's_cracked_up_to_be:"designmania"	This grater is not a convenience, it's more of a punishment.  I have tried it for hash browns, cheese, chocolate, etc.  I thought at first I was using it incorrectly, but then realized, there really is no wrong way of using this.  Everytime I have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that I would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually.  My fingers and hands ache so bad that I can't even hold a pencil after using this gadget.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  Unfortunately, you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star, but in reality I give it NO STARS!	0

B00020BP2A:don't_be_fooled:shannon_wortham_"shongzah"	This is a very powerful handheld vacuum cleaner.  If you just need to clean up loose this like salt or cracker crumbs it will perform great.  Should you actually try to use the beater brush attachment you will be very dissappointed.  I bought this cleaner for the purpose of cleaning my curtians and stairs.  I own two cats and virtually all of my in-laws are allergic to them.  Everytime they come, I have to clean the house top to bottom.  My upright vacuum (Dirt Devil Vision Lite model 008650) weighs a ton and was not designed to use on stairs.  I thought this little cleaner might be just the trick.  The brush worked great the first several times I used it.  But after about 20 uses it began to slow down.  I cleaned it very thoroughly but never saw the initial performance again.  Eventually, it stopped working at all.  I urge you to buy something else, if the beater brush is a selling point for you	0
B0002MM5AO:sanyo_sc-x1000p__canister_vacuum:g._galluppi	My wife and I have used this machine for several weeks now. We found it to be a great machine for the price.

Now there are no limitations as to what surface the machine can be used on. This thing is lite, strong, and easy to empty. The cord retractor is a little lite so I wouldn't be to rough with it.

B00005M1V0:good_coffee.__not_worth_the_aggravation!:steven_e._joseph	A friend of ours bought this for us.  He owns several coffee shops and we were excited to have great coffee at home.  Out of the box, I needed to tinker with it for a while and had to refer to online chat rooms to figure out how to get it to work correctly.  The problem was that the coffee didn't stay perculating long enough in the top and then it shot down into the carafe. I called Bodum of North America and their customer service person was a surley $$***!!!!!!*****.  They offered no help at all and had no idea what I was talking about which unless they totally disregard internet reviews was a lie.  Several people wrote, in online articles, to cut down the tube that goes in to the carafe by small dimension.  I didn't do that but I learned that if you don't push the top down all the way it will work okay.	0

B00004VXB9:where_are_the_replacement_batteries?:fina	We have had the cordless blender for 3 years now, and although it was a bit cumbersome at first because we were used to the lighter and smaller corded version, it was a great benefit for a well used kitchen. Clean up was a breeze, too. The worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery, which, withihn a year, took less and less of a charge after each use. Now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once. It does not surprise me that Cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately, which, in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence, but in turn, Cuisinart should not be surprised when I never buy another one	0

B00008GSX5:not_durable:l	Bought this set at Target 3 years ago for $200, and during the first few months was seriously impressed by them.  They're heavy, cooked things well, and the stainless handles are strong and stay cool.  Never once put them in the dishwasher or put any utensil (metal, etc) in them that didn't belong in them.  Took care when washing, didn't burn things in them, etc.  Somehow the finish still flaked off of both skillets starting at 6 months, and the pots have now also been showing the early signs of retirement. Because I didn't want to pay return shipping or get a replacement set, and the flaking finish was too dangerous for donating, they had to go straight to the trash.  Very upsetting that such gorgeous pots and pans had such a short life, with high care and high cost.  The 2nd star is because they are beautiful and I cooked every day with these - if you rarely cook and plan to take care of these, they might work for you.  For me, stainless steel and cast iron is the way to go.  I wouldn't even try another "non-stick finish"	0
B00006JL09:i_bought_an_upscale_product?:dennis_k._lawson_"amaten"	Within 2 weeks, the pause & brew didn't exist. The coffee poured all over when I tried to pull the carafe for a cup.

B0002F56CU:wish_i_had_another_slow_cooker...:s._boston_"s-boston"	My husband bought this for me for Christmas 2005.  I was thrilled to get it since I had an older, smaller model.  I had never burned any food in a slow cooker before I used this model.   I couldn't figure out how to get it to cook SLOWLY.  I finally called customer service and was told I wasn't using the right kinds of recipes.  She told me that the pot had to be at least 75% full.  I used her advice, but it still boils everything on every temperature level.  I use it to make roasts and that is all.  It "sweats" horribly and I have to put it on a cutting board so it doesn't burn my countertop.  The handle cracked after 6 months.  My biggest "ah-ha" moment was when I came home after a long day out.  There had been a power surge, and it had reset itself.  My whole meal was ruined and that is when I realized the value of a dial-knob slow cooker.  Just back away slowly from this one	0

B00008YO16:don't_waste_your_money!!:gary_kelsey	I have a lot of low-voltage lights on our house.  Many colors and different wattages, which I dearly love.  Unfortunately, the spiders also love to build webs on the siding because flying insects are attracted to the lights.  One night I used my Panasonic vacuum (which I love) and got over 30!  The motor chews them up and spits the pieces into the disposable bag--I've never had one survive! Nice jolly subject, right? Often, I have to hold the vacuum in one hand (20 lbs.) while using the hose with attachment in the other.  This gives me over 3 ft. of reach and the suction is so great that the insect is "gone" within 1" of the brush.  OK, the Lentek is rechargeable, doesn't have a power cord and is lite (albeit unwieldly).  After charging for a day the unit would pick up a 1/8" spider but nothing larger.  After a minute of operation the suction is down by about half and you won't get anything then.  Yes, I'm back to the Panasonic and the Lentek?---the "round file"!	0

This "aquarium" is way too small, betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1-2x weekly atleast. This is probably 1/2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day, t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills. This also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring, no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn't good. You can also buy large Critter Carriers (2-3 gallons) for the same price or less, it wouldn't be great, but it'd be a heck of a lot better	0

B0000SWABO:won't_stand_behind_product:jameswright6161	At first, we loved this ultra quiet vacuum cleaner. After one year, however, it started sounding like a jet engine. The turbo-nozzle had broken. I live in a major city and no one within the city limits services these things, and when I ordered a new turbo nozzle, they sent a mini. It turns out that the actual replacement nozzle, listed at $29.99 a year ago, now costs $125.00! The explanation I got was "Prices are subject to change without notice." Now I'm stuck with a 5-inch mini turbo nozzle and my wife is going to kill me. Plus the cord, which used to snap back into the cannister at the touch of a button, creeps in while we're vacuuming--and when we press the button too. I love it at first, but I'll never buy another Electrolux. It's not well made, and they don't stand behind their product.	0

B000AAT6ZK:nice_at_first_but_rusts_away_very_easy:j._sung	Bought this knife set 3 months ago. It was beautiful with unique patterns on the blade and very sharp. But within few days we noticed it rusts very quickly. We left a knife in the sink in the morning after breakfast, by the time we came home for dinner the knife had several rust spots. We had to use Barkeeper's friend to clean all the rust out. We've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the #*@ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms. Once, when someone else was helping clean up, one went into the dishwasher. It didn't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away! Now the knife has jagged edge!!! I guess if I grind down the knife about 1mm I'll have a full edge again but I didn't expect this from top-of-the-line knives. Will not buy this brand of knives anymore	0
B00004S9GB:soviet_design_--_bulky,_heavy,_and_imprecisely_put_together:katya	This juicer is extremely heavy, made of industrial type metal parts, but it's poorly machined and assembled.  The heavy parts don't fit together well, and the juicer is wobbly and unstable, despite it's heaviness.  I am sending this back without using it once, becuase there's no way to adjust the parts, and it's too unstable to use as is.  Also, it really is almost impossible to pick up and move, due to the weight, without straining your back.  Finally, like a reviewer of the orange-x large-size juicer, I find the industrial chemical smell of the parts unpleasant, and the enamel paint is chipped and scratched in many places.  It seem like the kind of company where to get a good product, you'd have to go to a store and look through several boxes to try to find an undamaged one	0

All complaints were that the ring is not loud enough to hear if you are in another room, have a fan on or are listening to the TV or radio. Replacing the battery does not remedy the problem either. If you want a kitchenaid timer invest in one of the Red, Black, Blue, White or Tangerine ones that are entitled Digital timer with rotating dial - no one has any complaints over this style of KitchenAid timers.	0
B0002T1G3E:short_lived:kimberjs	Until a week ago, I'd have given this coffee maker four stars because it has brew-strength control.  Last week, though, the clock face turned entirely black and this morning the unit completely malfunctioned. The shut off alarm sounded after only an hour but when I went into the kitchen to salvage the last of the coffee, I discovered the unit was still on.  Draining the pot, I attempted to shut the unit off manually and it kept coming back on. I finally got it shut off and 10 minutes later it turned itself back on again. After unplugging it, the unit went into the trash. I strongly suspect steam was able to get into the mechanism causing the electronics to short circuit. Obviously, it is a fatal design flaw--or a clever ploy to force people to buy more coffee makers. In all, it lasted about eight months	0
B0007CXQQ6:disappointment:m._mccarty	The only good thing which occurred when I bought this item from Amazon was it arrived with in two days.  I was quite disappointed when I opened the package only to find it was a typical pop-up hamper I could have bought anywhere in a store thus in the long run I ended up paying more for it.  I wanted to buy a pop-up hamper with a lid that you can zip it to stay closed.  This hamper lacks a lid so I reccomend if you're looking for the same thing not to buy it.  If I had known it lacked a lid I would not have purchased the hamper.  It's partially my own fault for not doing enough research about the product.  I gave it two stars because it's still functional and sturdy	0
B00080FM9G:quick-cup_versus_eco-pad...winner_is_eco-pad!:peter_hopper	I have explored a number of different ways to use my own grind of coffee in the Senseo Coffeemaker.  Folding filter paper didn't work....too much water goes by the filter making a week cup of coffee....The Quick-Cup sounded like a good idea....but it doesn't fit the holder tightly enough and too much water goes around the filter to get a good cup of coffee.  I found that the Eco-Pad fits tightly into the two cup holder and it works well.  The key to any of these re-usable pods is that water cannot be allowed to go around the filter.  The pressurized hot water must be forced through the coffee.	0
B0002TU4FA:neat_looking...and_that's_all.:j._martin	Seriously, for as good as their mixers are, their knives are really, really disappointing.  Flimsy, dull, easily bent and broken.  Within the first week of use, our paring knife bent a full 90 degrees at the tip and needed regular re-straightening before it eventually broke off altogether a couple months later.  The steak knives are now following suit, and the handle of the chef's knife has completely seperated from the blade.  Gah!  Don't waste your money	0
B0000CFRTP:if_you_order_this_item,_prepare_to_wait_more_than_a_month!:jbad	I ordered this item and received several notices postponing its delivery.  Eventually, I cancelled my order because more than a month has gone by, and still, no table and chairs	0

B00069SOI0:compact_size,_good_storage,_poor_aesthetics_and_finish:john_w._wallace_"renaissance_man"	Functionally, this product holds plenty of media in an easily accessible manner.  It is not attractive to look at however.  My walnut finish was closer to a cheap mahogany, there are multiple areas where the finish migrated along the seams and left areas with nearly no finish, the varnish is very high gloss, and the knobs are low-grade, mismatched junk.  I believe the build is solid, but only time will tell.	0
B0000B2EYO:product_5_stars,_packing_-3_stars,_hassle_-1_star:rock_bottom	Great looking set if they could arrive here without being broken. Amazon, how can you continue to ship these out to customers when it is so obvious that the manufacturer doesn't pack them well enough for shipping?	0
B000A33B0S:bad_choice:george_kristoff	I bought this fryer and used it twice.  The 3rd time I got the error message on the screen and could not get it to work, even hitting the reset button wouldn't get it going. I had to take it to an authorized dealer for repair and he got it working.  I used it one more time and it went out again. I took it back and two months later I received a new fryer in the mail.  The new one doesn't have the digital controls, it's back to the old fashion dial for temperature setting.  If you look on their web site this fryer is no longer there.  The one that they sent me is there instead of the Dual Zone.  When the fryer worked, it did a great job, however it didn't work very long.  I will be using my new one tonight to fry some fish and french fries.  My guess is that it will work as it should, since they got rid of that stupid Dual Zone control.	0

B0000AFX4J:very_expensive_mistake,_awful_customer_service:botanica_37	I've own my X3 for about 2 years now and overall, it has been used to make one double espresso daily. So when it stopped working a month ago, I was heartbroken. Called FF, after some back and forth I sent the machine in for repair. The cost of repairing it is about $200, incl. the shipping. Add that to the $499 I paid for it and this turns out to be one very expensive machine.	0
B000634M3C:don't_use_dark_fountains:j._j._boutall_"jboutall"	Petmate makes a great fountain, but their black model should be discontinued.  It is impossible to tell if the water is clean by looking at it.  When I went to wash this fountain, like I usually do every couple of weeks, there was a purplish color slim growing by the pump and the charcoal filter was covered with it.  I think the pump motor might have been leaking (I'm not really sure). If I had their white fountain I would have noticed there was a problem with the water right away	0
B000GQSQTK:this_is_not_silent...:a._wan	I wanted a humidifier that was silent, but when I plugged this in, not only could I hear it from the other room, but it's a high-pitched whine. I don't know what to do about it. I think I'll probably just return it for something different	0

B0009O1ELG:singer_7442_80_stitch_sewing_machine:laura_j._everidge	I liked the price and all the different stitches.  However, I needed a sewing machine that would handle many varied things, such as alterations and heavy sewing.  I'm very disappointed in the lightweight quality of this machine.  The needle threader never worked and on close inspection my husband found that a tiny hook was missing that was supposed to hold the thread.  Also, the food feed stalls, jerks and surges.  This machine has beautiful stitches, but is for lightweight sewing only	0
B0000AYIXG:arrived_broken:michael_brotherton	I like this type of opener very much, and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing.  So I opened the package, and tried to open a bottle of wine, but the corkscrew would not lock.  I'm not even sure I'll send it back given the warranty hassle, shipping costs, etc, given the price.  I just can't recommend this brand to anyone	0
B000065UEX:simply_re-used_parts_by_villaware!!!!:k._bussard_"internet_shopper"	The problem with this is that (as it appears to me) VillaWare has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it's Panini Grill (which for the record is an excellent product - which I have given rave reviews).  Check out the Panini Grill - unless you had these products in front of you & were able to open them up, you'd never be able to tell the difference between them.  I would say, don't write off VillaWare products just because of one poor one, as I said I also own the Panini Grill & LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  However, don't waste your money on this one - I hope VillaWare does right by their respected name & pulls this off the market completely.	0

B000KG6NT6:looks_aren't_everything:dot_g._"shotz613"	We too have the same issues with this that everyone else has mentioned.  We already had to trade it in after using it only once because of some sort of electronic malfunction on the espresso side that just made the digital screen blink on and off, nothing in the troubleshooting guide fixed the problem.  Now a month after using the new one, its espresso pump is loud and noisy, sounding like its broken. Also for some reason or another it won't send the water all the time through the brew head to make the espresso.  It ends up going into the overflow container to be dumped out. But then wait alittle bit and it starts to work fine.  Its been going for the last couple of days, but its such a iffy thing. On the plus side it does look nice! And it does make a good tasting espresso when it does work! My husband does agree with the directions are hard to follow, but he says that about everything	0
B0000959GD:look_for_a_shot_glass_with_additional_measuring_units:shay_lynn_"shay_in_colorado"	I found at a housewares store (Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or the like) a shot glass with several different units of measurement: fluid ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons (in half-tablespoon increments) and ML's.  Much more useful than this product, especially if you're measuring for weight loss purposes and can have EXACTLY two and a half tablespoons of that salad dressing	0
B00004S9G7:a_big_mistake:	i tried this thermal coffee press - delighted to see it was 1/2 the price of other thermal coffee presses - but in this instant you get what you pay for 1) the coffee doesn't stay as hot as a regular thermos 2) when you press the grains down to the bottom they leak back up into the thermos and your last cup of coffee looks and taste like mud 3) its these times that you wish you bought the item in the store because now i have to pack it back in its box and send it back	0

B0002XGKHC:just_say_no.:mboy	Amazing that in 2005 you can read review after review on Amazon about the poor quality of almost every toaster offered. We hoped this one would be an exception. It was, but only in that it may be the poorest of them all. Ours buzzed loudly whenever in use. Never had a toaster buzz before. We toast bread at least twice a day, and the toasting performance of this unit is horrible. It has no bagel setting (which toasts the cut side more than the crust side), so we ended up with one side burnt and the other barely starting to toast. What's more, it toasts completely unevenly. One corner of toast will be blackened while the far corner will barely be tanned. And it's really annoying when a 4-slice toaster does not allow you to operate the heating elements independently. As far as looks go, De'Longhi did just as bad a job. The photos look cool, but the crumb tray this unit "sits" upon is actually wider than the unit itself, so there is a big uneven gap at the seam. It's the lower line you see in the photos--but they make it look real nice for that! What you don't see is the other side of the toaster where the bottom crumb tray will be sticking out several MM from the side of the toaster rather than being flush as shown. This makes it look broken, like two pieces of something that no longer fit together. If De'Longhi had spent even a second thinking about this, they would have done the opposite: The bottom tray should be slightly smaller than the toasting unit, which would give the unit a seamless look rather than a busted look. (We even went to a store [yes, a real store] to confirm that they are all like this, and they are.) Also, the bread warming rack is another poorly designed element. There are 4 tiny plastic feet inserted into the four metal posts of the rack so it doesn't scratch the metal surface of the toaster. However, two of the feet had already fallen out during shipping, and though they slipped right back in, all four of the tiny feet can easily be removed or fall out (only friction holds them in) and you WILL loose them very quickly--especially if you ever wash the rack. We're happy to pay extra for a quality item--even a toaster--but we expect something in return besides utter dissapointment. Final advice: Stick to the $20 toasters with functions such as bagel, defrost, and dual controls. If it's ugly, keep it under the sink and only take it out when you use it. This one looks broken, performs poorly, and costs a lot of money. If you do buy this model, maybe you'll get ours...we returned it	0
B000FBKQ0S:espresso_maker_leaks:l._bautista_"lynelle"	Searched for a long time to find a good quality espresso machine that didn't cost over $500.  We had a great workhorse Krups combo espresso coffee machine that was still working after 15 years.  Was hoping this one would be the newer, more powerful, fancier model.  Boy are we sorely disappointed.  The coffee part works fine.  Unfortunately the espresso part leaks all over from the gasket and doesn't even produce hot espresso.  I exchanged this once, hoping I just got a bad one but apparently the Krups XP2010 is designed badly.  Shame on Krups for releasing a premature, untested product	0
B0007KVOQW:not_as_cool_as_i_hoped:christy_peterson	I really wanted this cereal dispenser to ease the morning rush. Unfortunetly it is just messy,annoying and takes up counter space. When you turn the nob it crunches the cereal and much of it flies in every direction. If the cereal is too big (honeycomb size) it doesn't come out easily. If it is too small (fruity pebbles) it comes out too easily and gets everywhere! I definetly would not buy this product again. At one point I even had ants crawl up my counter into the dispenser and had to throw all the cereal away. The time saved by not getting the box of cereal from the pantry is spent cleaning cereal of the counter	0
B0000CNQW6:not_what_i_expected,_can't_be_assembled:ddr	I was excited when I read the great reviews for this product, but I was very dissapointed when I received it.  I wanted this because I live in an apartment complex where I have to carry my laundry some distance to the laundry room.  I thought it would be great to just be able to wheel it over with this.  However, when I tried to put it together out of the box (it requires complete assembly), though it is simple to put together, not one of the small screws that hold the top bars on to the unit fit!  All four will go half-way in and no further.  Perhaps I got a faulty unit, but I see it falling apart soon because of this. Also, the bag itself seems flimsy.	0
B00004OCM5:too_sharp:	I have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and I have a lot of experience peeling vegetables...I am fast and have rarely cut myself.  However, I bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago I cut myself so severly with it, I thought about going to the hospital.  This peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others I have used and so it some how gives me an &quot;out of control&quot; feeling with each thrust.  It is also extra sharp.   I can't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well	0
B000630N1C:broken_top__-_try_and_get_replacement_-_good_luck:t._robinson	The item is not packed well for shipping. The drawer and top were cracked.

B0002EXVNC:automatic_dish_dumping_rack:e._spohn	Unless you're planning on washing dinner plates only, this dish rack is not for you. Smaller plates (or bowls for that matter) are not secured by the inadequate wire lips ( about 1/8 inch )so they fall flat and then fall out onto the floor because the sides are completely open (3 1/4 inches) . Anything small dumps out of the side opening and onto the floor. The utensil basket has a divider which moves around and your utensils end up laying down in the bottom. I bought this thinking that since Polder has a good name, it would be a good product. I was wrong and Polder should be ashamed of such inadequate design	0

B00065L4YU:r.i.p.:reviewer	I bought this kettle in February 2006. I liked everything about it until its automatic ON-OFF switch died recently - only two months after the purchase. Now the kettle won't turn on. It wasn't abused in any way, and these kettles usually last for years and years. The last one of similar kind served me well for 12 years until it started to leak and was replaced with this spanking new Proctor Silex K4070.	0
B0000505J1:didn't_like_at_all!:susan	The can opener does not swing tight and once installed, kept swinging out instead of staying stowed.

B0002XAIP2:not_all_i_thought_it_would_be.:r._crist	The detector was simple enough to use, although it required alot of batteries(8).  But the results were mixed.  Urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances. Even in areas where I knew there had been an accident, it was difficult to spot the difference.  All in all, I generally wouldn't recommend this.  (Although it did clearly show a distressing amount of what I believe is mold in the bathroom.)	0
B0000BYENW:so_disapointed:happy_campet_"happy_camper"	After reading the reviews on this product I thought it would be a great space heater for my apt.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  It barely gets hot - even on the highest setting - and gives off almost no heat!!	0
B0009PRVGM:poor_merchandise:kevin_f._dolan_"yogi_k"	This towel start falling apart after one wash and a tumble dry on low--one inch strings were sticking out all over the surface and little balls of frabric (like dust-bunnies) formed on it too.  Perhaps it would be good to use as an oil rag, but not in one's bathroom	0
B000064849:works_well,_briefly...:	As far as whisks for non-stick surfaces go, the silicone-encased wires are very flexible--a far cry from the hard, thick plastic whisks with only a few wires.  They are ideal for non-stick surfaces except for one problem.  The silicone is soft and not durable.  After a few uses or getting banged around with other utensils in the drawer, the silicone gets easily cut.  The silicon then easily peels exposing the stainless wire inside which defeats the purpose.  I have been very careful, but this works out to probably $2 each time I used it	0
B00021Q1H8:5_stars_for_the_product,_-3_stars_for_the_packaging:rock_bottom	I love the SANGO NOVA BROWN dishware and rate it 5 stars. This boxed set of bowls is just not padded enough for the weight. The slightest rough handling by a shipper is going to result in damage as can be seen in the prior reviewer's comments. Mine too arrived broken. Sure seems like Sango would put a bit more padding between those bowls in the box. Amazon could also do a better job of protecting this item when they pack it for shipping. I sure hope Amazon gets credit from Sango for all these broken pieces. Combined score +2	0

B00005QTX9:no_replacement:harmony_child	Although its description said it is a replacement carafe also for a different model, for which I bought it, it did not fit at all.  I felt it a nuisance to return it, so I did not return it.  But I certainly wasted the money I paid.  I was very unhappy	0
B000AO1CIU:cute_set,_very_cheaply_made_&_very_rough:stevy_hill_"jaxonsparents"	I was so excited to get this set in the mail for my son, but when I took it out of the package it felt like sandpaper. I have washed it several times but it is still very rough. Also the first time I washed it one seam ripped all the way down the side and frayed. It was very cheaply made, but my son does love it, purely because its Thomas I'm sure. I wouldn't buy this again	0

After about a year the spinning brush only goes on when the handle is tilted a certain way. Still has very good power. Bad news, it doesnt move around easy. It is like dragging an old tire around, hard to turn and direct, canister always rolls over. The only reason i am still using it is because i only have area rugs in a large apt, and dont vacumn that often, i guess because i dread using it. I am looking for a simipler unit with a bag because the hepa filter starts to smell after a while. But still like i said, lots of power if you keep the filter clean	0

B00005AM8J:expensive_mistake_from_krups:m._juran_"toddler_twins,_no_time!"	I bought this coffee maker with great faith in the Krups name -- willing to order online without the "touch factor" -- I was sorely disappointed.  WHile the concept seems promising, the actual product is a failure.  The carafe is awkward and you have to fiddle with it every time to pour your coffee.  And, the handle simply came off after just 6 months of normal use (a.m. coffee only).  And there is no way to fix it as the bolts are lodged inside and can't be accessed.  An expensive mistake and to think I'd looked to Krups to solve my problem of having to replace coffee makers every six months or so.  Don't waste your money and I personally will avoid the Krups brand from now on.	0
B00004RHN2:these_don't_expand_to_fit_all_wine_bottles:j._kitchens	I previously had a chrome wine stopper purchased from another store, but it was damaged by falling into an active garbage disposal, so I bought these as replacements.

All three stoppers in the set had the same problem.	0

B00068UTJI:too_small_and_awkward:k._shoebotham_"pookiegen"	While cute, this little pan is difficult to use. There's no room to use a spatula, so you'd better like the eggs cooked through - you can't flip for over easy, and the egg white is too deep to do sunny-side up. Also the handle gets hot and the little plastic egg bit is not enough to grip, so you have to use a potholder. Plus, it's so small that it won't fit any normal-sized burner - another burn risk to your fingers	0

B0009314RQ:ok_unit:john_a._david_"jd"	Gaggia used to be the cat's meow in espresso. They have lost the bubble in the last ten years. Many other machines do more, are easier to use, and produce better cups in an easier manner. i still have my old Gaggia, but now rely on a Saeko in my home. The difference is obvious	0
B000153ZXS:toasts_unevenly:m._maddocks	This appliance has several good features, but they are outweighted by the fact that it does not produce a decent piece of toast.  At the lowest setting one side of the toast comes out too brown, the other side barely toasted.  The inner side of the bread toasts faster than the outer side. We did manage to get a decent piece of toast by inserting the bread, setting a timer for 1 minute, pressing cancel, reversing the bread, and slowly counting to thirty before pressing cancel again.  Far too much work	0
B0002IC8J6:i_can_see_why_the_price_dropped!:absolutely_love_cooking	I had one of the originals...with the vaneer look.  --Ugly yes, but it was actually very sturdy & well made.  Unfortunately, it got lost in a move.	0
B00068J25U:henckels_twin_pro_s-8-inch_chef's_knife_w/hollow_edge:g._high_"creative_cook"	The knife is constructed well - as pictured - does not cut very well.  It just was not very sharp.

B00009V4C2:don't_buy_this_cuisipro_grater!!!!:cynthia_h._fogle	LOUSY!!!!  The handle design makes the Cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold.

B000G2TIT6:wouldn't_recommend:ali	I purchased this set of spoons because they are narrow and can fit into any number of spice jars.  I also wanted them because they are hinged and nest inside of each other & take up little space.  After first use, the pin fell out and the spoons became unhinged.  I tried to reassemble and the pin keeps falling out - wouldn't recommend	0
B000FL9QUO:not_a_high_quality_insulated_tumbler.:j._kleen	Received set and tumblers are not good quality. The edges are quite sharp and the glass still sweats. Would not recommend	0
B000K6IEHA:worst_quality:c._curless	After remodelling our kitchen, I wanted to upgrade the look of items that would be sitting out. When I saw the picture of the towel holder, I thought it unique with its scroll-work and wouldn't look like everything else I saw. When I received it, the first thing I noticed was that the base had ugly black smudge marks on the area that would be visible. I tried with no luck to remove the stains. The area where the short post attaches screws in crookedly because the threaded receiver was set at a tilt! All in all, I would not trust this company to have consistant quality in their workmanship	0

B000GHDOIM:don't_bother:matthew_t._moses_"mosauce"	OK...this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted. It barely picks up even simple dirt and debris, and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds, not minutes.	0

B0009WRKSE:_it_really_sucks!__and_not_in_the_way_it's_supposed_to!:n._gunnar_"janet_n"	Moved into a new home. Wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets, decided to try a bagless model. This thing is a total waste of money. It has barely any suction whatsoever, especially when trying to use the hose, so for now after running this thing I have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets, to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn't suck up. It's ridiculous,it's a brand new vacuum! I have never had to do this with any other vacuum. I had my husband make sure it was working right and it is, it just has a very weak suction. This thing is going back to the store and I am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Also, I have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping, and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors (well, they all pretty much do that job, but for some reason this has a bare floor setting, whoop de do!)it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor, nor can it suck up a cobweb! DON'T BUY	0
B0007XXHD2:two_machines_one_cup_of_coffee:a._urban_"mackaboogie"	I ordered this machine for my wife after reading dozens of reviews and and positive feedback. We followed the instructions explicitly and created one cup of coffee. After that the machine said "ventilate". We followed the proceedures for ventilating the machine and it seemed to correct itself. Went to make another cup of coffee and it said "ventilate". This time it would not fix itself. I tried to perform the ventilate process and it would simply spray hot water out into the tray. Turn off the knob and "ventilate" comes back up on the screen. Turn the machine off and turn it back on, "ventilate" came up on the screen.	0
B0000DKHIC:do_not_buy:h_"m"	The thermometer of this heater is completely messed up. It does not measure the room temperature, but the temperature of the air that has just been heated up. In other words, if your room temperature is 60 degrees and you program it to heat up the room to 70 degrees it will do so (according to the thermometer reading) in less 2 minutes and stop. If you do not use this functionality, but instead let the heater run for some time (5-10 minutes) the thermometer will want to make you believe that the room temperature has gone up to 90 degrees. The thermometer is probably in the wrong location. Did Honeywell do any kind of testing before putting this model on the market ?	0
90962	I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate.  It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page.  The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed.  So, functionally, it gets a solid A.	1
187208	This was my first calaphalon purchase and I am so impressed that I plan on using nothing but calaphalon in the future. This pan is shallow and bigger around than normal 2 1/2 qt pans.The unique design of this pan means less cooking time and more evenly heated food. Hand washing the pan is easy. I love this pan !!	1
281933	We have owned other Hoover steam cleaners.  They did a terrific job but all ended up leaking.  We purchased a Bissel and returned it due to the soggy carpet.  We bought the Hoover F5914-900 based on the reviews.  I was confident that it wouldn't leak because of the reviews and the fact that this was made in America.  I was confident it would be a better product and Hoover had gotten their act together.  We have grandchildren and 3 dogs so our carpets are constantly under attack.  I couldn't keep affording to have the carpets professionally cleaned when I knew Hoover could do just as good a job.  Ok...our Hoover came.  My husband put it together and it leaked all over.  I then re-read the reviews and a few had mentioned how important it was to read the directions and put it together by exactly following them.  By then we had already taken it to the repair center.  After a week they had not touched it.  My husband picked the machine up  and brought it home.  We decided to start from square one and put it together again.  He did, following the directions to the letter. Lo and behold...no leaks!!!!!  Yeah!  My carpets are beautifully clean and I am a very happy woman.  So...the moral to this story is always read the directions first	1
430410	I've read a number of complaints about food sticking and difficulty with cleaning.  We've experienced neither of these - make sure the heat is not too high and clean with hot water!  It's a great saucepan and the price was great.  Highly recommended	1
511110	This is a significant improvement over the 750 model. The 750 model was not very well designed. The first one we purchased broke within 3 days because the blade came up and hit the plastic. We returned this. We got the 760 to replace that. The 760 has been redesigned to avoid this problem. For the same price as the 750, the 760 comes with one extra bowl,  juicer and egg whisk. Compared with others like the Cuisinart and we determined that this was much better constructed.	1
B000FFQ554:it_made_my_marriage_better..........:mom_of_4_good_kids	My only complant is that the cord is shorter then I am used to. But I guess it needs to be for the automatic rewind. This feature is a must however since my husband always griped at me for not coiling up the cord properly.	1
B000050993:memories:l_k_devries	My mother had a set of Franciscan Apple dinnerware as I was growing up, though I never thought too much about what I was eating off of at the time.  Later, as a wife and mother myself, I was looking for a theme around which to decorate my kitchen.  We had just moved to Appleton, WI (16 years ago) so I decided to use an &quot;apple&quot; theme, w/o even connecting the idea with my mom's dishes.  I was frankly surprised to visit my parents and become reacquainted with the Franciscan dishes. Over the years I've collected innumerable apple items, but my goal is to have a set of Franciscan apple dishes of my own!  They do chip, but they last forever and retain their color beautifully	1
B000AAT6QE:super_sharp-rockin'_knife:chop-a-holic_"basenji_mom"	Admittedly, I am a bit of a knife-buying nut.  I love kitchen knives and own chef's knives and santuko knives from Wusthof, Henckels, Kyocera and Furi.	1

B000F930FS:highly_recommend_this_item!:d._sorenson	This is my first "electric" litter box.  I have two cats and they took to it the first day it was set up.  It really decreases the usually strong smell of a litter box.  It was a breeze to set up.  I also purchased the tent to go on top and that has worked well keeping the litter from flying all over the cats' bathroom floor. And with the tent they can't hang their bottoms over the side of the box and accidentally leave a BM on the floor.  I'm going to use rewards points from a credit card to purchase the replacement litter cartridges and that will keep the cost of maintaining it down	1
B00069SOHQ:great_product,_poor_shipping:c._hajek	This is a very nice piece of furniture.  Well built, good quality.  It was shipped via UPS and the box was quite damaged when it arrived.  Thank goodness for good packaging, or it would have been destroyed.  One of the doors did have a crack in it and a new door is to be shippped shortly.  A new mode of shipping should be considered.	1
B0006N8UHG:meat_grinder:s._mazzilli	After several tries and telephone calls to my brother; I finally have the blade in the correct position (I had problems with the directions in the book). It works great now.  A reminder to oil the blades before you put the machine away; they rust easily if damp	1
B000FSFNVI:a_fan_furever!:r._l._pursley_"armadillo_lady"	This is one amazing tool. We went from vacuuming 3 times a week to once a week. We simply can't believe the difference. The dog seems to love it, too. I don't have to work on him as long or hard or often as I did with the standard rake. I am a fan FURever	1
B0008155BU:perfect_size_for_lunch:chris_sandvig_"chris_sandvig"	These bowls are a perfect size for holding one portion.  Much better than plastic containers that melt in the microwave.  I use one almost every day for taking  my lunch to work.  At $2.99 it more than pays for itself every time you use it (verses buying a take out lunch).	1

B0007ZH13M:works_great_and_enjoys_a_place_on_the_counter:maureen_a._boutwell	There's nothing worse than having to find space for, and then digging out a small appliance every time you want to use it. Henrietta looks terrific sitting on the countertop, and because she's on the countertop, you will use her. She works great. Will hold seven large eggs just fine for hard or soft boiling. I tried jumbos and she will only hold 4 jumbos at a time as they are fatter eggs, but seven large eggs at a time is fine with me. She poaches four eggs perfectly, and here, you can use jumbos if you like. The water reservoir is clearly marked and once you use her, if you find that your eggs are not quite done enough or too done, adding more or less water the next time will take care of that. Actually, the first time I poached jumbos, I found that the eggs were still a bit too liquid for my taste; I added a bit more water to the cooker, plugged her back in, and the eggs were perfectly done in about another minute. When the water evaporates, she chirps loud enough for even someone who is hard of hearing (as I am). I love this cooker. First one I have ever owned. And because she looks cute sitting on the counter, I don't forget I have her; therefore, she gets used alot	1
B000FIIXLA:inexpensive_air_circulation:daniel_b._gilbert_"movie/book_aficionado"	Excellent for Fall & Spring here in Florida. Fans have a reversible switch which is very handy (don't have to turn the whole fan around)	1
B000E138DG:humidifier_filter:sally	The filter is the make and size recommended by the manufacturer of the humidifier.  It works really well.	1

B00013K8OY:visually_pleasing,_extremely_functional:van_forrest	I owned this dispenser for close to a year, and love it.  The cereal is always fresh and accessible and I do not have to keep the boxes or reach out to grab few nuts for a quick snack.  Great design	1
B000EZMHCK:great_for_cooking,_serving,_&_storing_*****:furbabies_"furbabies"	I took a chance on ordering these, and I'm glad I did.  They are heavy-duty!  I like the handles as I do a lot of microwave cooking and it's nice to be able to use the handles instead of having to have hotpads each time with the regular white corningware.  I've also used these in a convection oven, and them seem to work really great!  I picked the "Sapphire" color, and they are very attractive on the table as well!	1
B0000BVKYS:calphalon_10_pc__stainless_steel_cookset:	I received the 10 pc set from my husband for Christmas.  I have been very pleased with the quality and how easy they are to clean after use. Some veg did stain the bottom of the saucepans. Maybe this will disappear if tomatoes are cooked in them. The pans take longer to heat up because of the thickness and the weight but once they are hot they cook evenly. I feel we made a good choice	1
B0000AV0XQ:best_label_going_for_various_size_bottles:captain_audio	Due to the slits around the opening, this label will fit a wide variety of neck sizes including Burgundy and those odd Rosemount Shiraz necks.  I would like it better if it were more of a plastic coated paper since I think it would hold up longer in a cellar, but at least it fits all my bottles.  The others I've purchased don't	1

B00004RFOH:cold_steel_perfection!:belladonna_le_femme	This knife along w/the matching 7" 5-star meat fork are my weapons of choice for carving leg of lamb, prime rib, ham, veal, turkey, etc...at various carving stations at my job. I love the 5-star line & have most pieces from it as well as 2 of this knife. I'd recomend trying the 4-star & pro-s line out as well before deciding on this line(same blades, different handles). I'd definately replace if lost/stolen. After using proper tools there's no way you can go back to cheap knives. I'd love to see a 12" version of this knife w/a wider blade	1
B0000645Z6:great_product!:c._cotton	Looks and works just as advertised. Took it out of the box and used it the day we received it, made for a lovely and lively family dinner. Great buy	1
B0000C4JZH:fragile_but_worthy:greg_keats	I very much like THIS Sommlier glass but they are quite fragile.  A significantly better choice for everyday use is the Schott Zwiesel Diva line of glasses.  Granted, the Riedel glass is thinner at the rim but man, for my dollar, the Schott glasses are a steal	1
B000AF786O:very_small_and_to_the_point:brian_peyton_"bmp1967"	wife loves this contraption.  if you like your coffee or tea strong you need to use more than usuall.  easy to  clean. and the best part is that amazon sent me two of them when I purchased one.  sweet.  cup it comes with is great quality.  peace!	1
B0001HJZ62:beautiful.:ranch_girl	We purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago.  It has held up so well, that I just purchased ten more place settings (the Friday only sale) to use for entertaining.  Our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day.  This flatware is heavy and really nice to hold, (the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from).  The super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions.	1
B0009YDHO8:coffee_maker_that_rocks!:judith_c._alvarez_"judy_coffee_making_diva"	After much research and consideration I decided to buy this product as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I am not the type of person to research products before I buy them, but taking into consideration how picky my husband is about his espresso (and being Cuban and drinking cuban coffee since birth--makes you critical and suspicious about the quality of the coffee made by these new espresso machines), I did not want to buy something that was not going to meet our expectations. I have to say this product has surpassed my expectations and my husband is very pleased with it.  My main concern was how HOT the coffee would be, and this product makes the coffee with the right temperature and richness that we have come to expect from the corner cafeteria coffee.  I've read reviews about the noise it makes, and after having the Deloghi product, the noise this machine makes when warming up is NOT that loud at all.  We are very happy with it.  Buy it, you'll be happy too	1
B000EONEU0:easy_product:peter_j._psyllos	This product is great to have on hand. In the past, I've used purchased yogurt as a starter, but this eliminates the need to run to the grocery store when you want to make yogurt. After a small delivery snafu, the company immediately sent me a replacement. They also sent me a follow up e-mail just to make sure that I received the product (thanks Fred!!!	1

B00004R92T:better_than_sliced_bread!:james_r._mckinley	After mixing your dough and letting it rise the first time, this basket helps shape the dough into a perfect loaf, with an interesting pattern on the crust.  My first loaf with this basket turned out perfectly.  It is  much easier than hand shaping a loaf, and much more rustic/natural than  using a loaf pan.  The natural coils shape and decorate the loaf the  old-fashioned way. When it's done rising, carefully remove it from the  basket and care fully put it on a pre-heated bread stone in the oven.  The  loaves look and taste great	1
B00005LD3J:super_great!:lashonda_s._bates_"quick"	This bowl is very durable and I love the different colors that it comes in.  The bowl is dish washer and microwave safe and my kids have banged them in the sink what seems like hundreds of times.  We basically use them for eating cereal but have used them for eating ice cream, popcorn, nachos, etc.  I love these bowls and am going to buy a set of Fiestaware for my mom	1

B0006346EC:wonderful_but_can't_find_replacement_teases:kiyomi	My three cats adore this playpen.  Just moments after putting it on the floor, they started playing with the tease.  They also love snuggling in the bed together (2 cats fit at a time).  My only complaint is that I can't find the replacement teases -- they are supposed to be available in both catnip and non-catnip styles.  The manufacturer does not sell direct to the public and I can't find them at Petco's online store.  I would give this 5 stars if replacements were easier to find	1

B0000B2QYT:large_elegant_casserole_or_soup_tureen:ms._rena_sproston_"rena2007"	This Lenox piece holds an extremely large quantity of soup or casserole. It is microwave and oven proof to 350 degrees, so you can cook and serve in the same beautiful casserole/soup tureen.  Handles are sturdy, but short, so they are hard to grip with a cloth pot holder, but easy to grip with bare hands. Because of this feature, you may decide to use this as a serving dish only. Good for a large group rather than due to large capacity. We are a family of 2, so we would prefer a smaller casserole from Lenox	1

B000069CEL:great_for_wine_and_other_uses:suzanne_plambeck	Yes, it is made to be a decanter for half bottles, but yes it does easily hold a full bottle.  What I use this decanter for is to have a nice presentation of the wine at dinner.  So, I decant it then pour 2 to 4 glasses, and the rest of the wine sits in the decanter on the table until it is consummed.  If you use it in the same manner, you do not have to worry about the size (but again, it fits an entire bottle so do not fret about size unless you need maximum air contact).  I also bought a second one and use it as a water pitcher to have at the table, and guests love it	1
B0001KO9SI:great_machine_:coolzaz_"mrac69"	I was going to buy The Lello 45900 Ariete Espresso/Cappuccino Maker, because the price was so good , but I waited over three months because it was not in stock so I looked for a replacement and this machine was more than twice the price, but after using it, it's more than twice the machine I think , on the Amazon description it says the pump is a 16-bar pump , But after checking reviews on different web sites I think Amazon made a mistake because on all the other web sites ,it says the a pump  to be 17.5 bar pump, that's even better , And the other thing that I like, was the fact that it had a CD , that was not said on the description either , I never use a espresso machine before so seeing a short little videos was very helpful , shows and explains the basics, from making espresso two frothing the milk ,cleaning tips and more very helpful .	1
B000A3G59C:great_little_book_light:jason_klein	I had a regular incandescent book like in the same format with the light on an extendable arm.  Lasted a good while but the bulb finally went and I couldn't find a good replacement.  I saw the Triple LED book light and knew right away that it would be perfect.  I looked at a lot of lights and nothing compares to this.  You get great light that you can direct exactly where you need it.  And it only uses AAA batteries! Defintely gets the 5 star rating	1
B000C238V4:great_looking_sofa_transformer_!!:kanaan	We are using 2 Love seat throws for an old L-shaped sectional sofa. It really transformed the green plaid sofa into a nice burgundy color. The material quality is great for the price.	1
B0008D6VKC:wedding_cake_cookie_cutters:j._messina	The cookies were amazing. I really liked using these cutters. They came 5 days earlier which was perfect since I was doing them for bridal shower favors. The only problem I had was that I ordered two of the same size, and when they came in the mail, one was smaller. I had two different size cookies	1
B0009VEPX8:very_solid_pillow:john_o'bryan	This pillow holds the heart shape better than I expected from some of the other reviews.

B0002D0NDY:exceptional_product_and_customer_service:lauren_doherty	Luigi Bormioli has proven to me that they possess the exceptional quality of service that I would like to be able to expect from all vendors.  When my product arrived broken from shipment, amazone.com would not replace it due to the fact that it was past their deadline.  I contacted the Luigi Bormioli company and they were heappy to replace the broken glasses.  When they arrived, however, they were the wrong glasses.  I returned them to the company, along with the broken glasses I had received to be sure they sent the correct glasses.  Again they happily sent new glasses and even included a few extra in case any broke in shipment again.  I would highly recommend these glasses and this company	1

B00028K0VO:red_soup_tureen:larae_adams_"farmer"	This soup tureen and bowls are the greatest.  I use them a lot, and just throw them in the dishwasher.  Great value	1
B0006NAB8M:family_friendly:lonse_johnson_"family_friendly"	This is truly a great waffle maker to have if you have kids. They love to eat them and make their own	1
B000BI3P4E:cal_king_waterproof_mattress_cover:josephine_m._catalano_"jocaty"	Cal King sheets, etc are extremely difficult to get in the stores OUTSIDE of CALIFORNIA.... this was just what I saw in Mervyn's in LA.... a couple dollars less than retail.  Arrived promptly.  Washed it as soon as I got it and no shrinkage.  SUCH A DEA	1
B0000CD9WU:reveiw_from_salt_and_pepper_shakers:	What a great masterpiece! This beautiful salt and pepper shaker set is an attractive, useful set. Great to use for bright rooms! Cheery color- even the pepper will brighten your day	1
B00005NCX5:this_thing_rocks:delawaredrew	It makes the cleanest and purest coffee I have ever tasted.  I also use a Moka pot, A french press, and a drip  and only the press rivals the taste of this vacuum pot.  To those who had failures and could not get it apart, I have no idea what you are doing wrong, there is little to go wrong.  FIll the lower pot, put on the upper pot with grinds in it, heat it, watch the water infuse the grinds,, remove from heat and let it  go back down.  What is there to go wrong?	1
B000BPSTDO:would_have_loved_a_lid_with_it...:k._t._megin_"krazykanuck"	This is a massive skillet! Be warned it's heavy, but the handle and front grip help a lot when food is in the pan. It's preseasoned right out of the box and with a bit of care and extra seasoning this pan is great. I would have liked a cover to prevent grease splatter, but the high walls on the side help keep some of the splatter down	1
B000C2X92M:these_are_really_great_bags!:peter_a._mcgovern	Everything about our Miele (Red Velvet) vacuumn cleaner is top notch, including the bags. The nicest thing about them is the way you can slide a protective piece of cardboard over the bag hole when removing the bag. This prevents the dust and other vacuum dander from escaping as you walk the bag to your trash from the cleaner.	1
B00068UA8S:power_station:k	Works great. I purchase 3, one for my husband and 2 more for my children. Good design. However, it would be nice to have a bit more room on the station to accomodate larger products like a Blackberry, an Ipod and a Gameboy. The station is not wide enough to put three products like this on at one time	1
B0002MR0TA:great_quality:julia_a._toman_"tekiechick"	I was a little hesitant to spend over $10 for a splatter screen as most of them really aren't worth more than a few bucks.  However, I am VERY glad that I spent the extra money on this one.	1
B000COC5MK:a_marvel_of_low_tech:kevin_salerno_"icarustwo"	As a person who loathes cheap, clutter, infomercial  widgets I bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would be returned the same day.  This opener is large, requires an electric plug and takes up counter space.  But to my surprise it works amazingly well.  There is a foil cutter that is stored in the base.  The screw enters cleanly and seems to eliminate broken and shredded corks which can be frustrating.  Hold the button again and the cork emerges from the device and drops out.  I always liked my sturdy and simple stainless steel opener.  But this turned out to be a keeper. It's design is contemporary and clean, although it looks like it should do something more profound than just pull a cork. It's also a conversation piece provoking smiles from guests. A pleasant surprise, highly recommended and especially so for a person who lacks hand or wrist strength.	1
B0007WZP1A:heavy_duty_pan.:ioannis_g._stamatiou	Since I have been pleased with my T-Fal pressure cooker, I purchased this pan based on the quality of craftsmanship. I like this pan for frying. Its stainless steel with the thick aluminum heat diffuser bottom makes it robust (it is warp free). Other aluminum pans tend to warp over time. The nonstick surface seems to be less prone to scratches. However, I always recommend non metallic utensils for piece of mind. The center heat indicator is helpful to know when it's ready.	1
B0001M3MIY:egyptian_cotton_blanket:charlene_d._thaxton_"charlie_potter"	very nice, warm blanket, but too big for a full size bed, way too big	1
B000FMZS9G:perfect_for_2+_year-olds:eyes_wide_open	My daughter used this set and now my son uses it.  We threw out the fork by mistake so I'm ordering another set -- the fork is just perfect for a toddler but my almost 6-year old still loves the fork.  I'd highly recommend this	1
B0001FATNC:best_knife_storage_ever:james_lyman	We had our kitchen gutted and completely redone. I built a knife holder to use in a drawer. Now, with the Wusthof 25-slot, I have removed my home-made holder. The drawer can be used to store other items. I can fit a huge assortment of the knives we have been using for several years. There is no need to buy a lot of new knives. Just use a sharpener and keep those old friendly knives. Having the knives up on the countertop makes them much more accessible and therefore easier to select and use. You can't go wrong with this super storage block	1
B00004RFPJ:hints_and_tips_for_using_this_product:l._chantler	Although it has two prongs to do two shapes at the same time, I had problems with the cookies sticking together so I would recommend only using one mold at a time	1
B000IZDUJU:scooba_clean:lizkauai	Being used to the swiftness of the Roomba (10 stars!), the Scooba seems very slow. It does not follow the wall as much as the Roomba but at the end of the cycle, the floor is clean and sweet-smelling.	1
B00007BHZI:best_bakeware_ever:lexi_"lex"	THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR LE CREUSET'S ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE HEAT EVENLY, WITHSTAND HEAT WITHOUT STAINING, AND TO TOP IT OFF, IT'S SOOOO EASY TO CLEAN! WORTH EVERY PENNY	1
B0002AQQ5Q:quick_and_easy_for_an_affordable_price:a._nace_"loubelia"	I just bought this for my cat and it definitely keeps the mess and odor to a minimum. It cuts the cleaning time in half from 8-10 minutes of dumping the litter or sifting through it with a scoop, and spraying the box down- down to only 2 minutes. It's just overall so much better than any of the other litter boxes/litter maid products I've seen. And the price is reasonable.	1
B000ERNO0M:your_cat_will_love_this:carrie_crane_"craneca"	This is a wonderful item that your cat will love. I originally purchased a thermal mat from another website (more expensive with a pattern that I didn't like). My 3 cats fought over who would get to sleep on it, so I did a search and when I found this one, I ordered one for each of them. This cat mat has been such a hit with my furfaces and is such a great deal that I just ordered 3 more, for my dad, sister and a friend to give to their cats. I've seen similar thermal cat mats for $50+. The pattern that appears on the super soft side is a dark green with subtle black leopard print and the other side is black faux-sheepskin. My cats like both sides. You can throw them in the washing machine and fur doesn't stick to the smooth patterned side, which is nice. Of all of the cat beds I have purchased, including a heated window-mounted bed that plugged into the wall, this mat is my kitties' favorite thing to sleep on	1
B000BO4I8U:soft_and_great_quality!!!:l._tadeja_"lynn14"	I am very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is as described and I will buy more!	1
B00018HQBC:simple_and_beautiful:david_q._ziegler_"texasdave"	I love these glasses.	1
B000BAWS8Q:make_poached_egg_sandwiches_instead_of_butter_drenched_fried_egg_sandwiches,_your_heart_will_thank_you!:james_r._mason	I bought one of these in August of this year.  I used it daily to make a ham/egg/cheese/english muffin sandwich every morning with great results.  However, after about a month, the non-stick coating started to bubble then peel off from the egg poaching pan.  I called Back To Basics and had a new pan free of charge within a few days.  The new pan has been in use for two months without issue.  The people at Back To Basics were very kind and shipped my new pan without hassle.	1
B00004RFLW:these_are_great_knives:george_s.	I bought this knife and block set as a Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it.  Our only disappointment was that the block was a different style than that shown on Amazon or, for that matter, on the box it arrived in.  The picture showed a block with six slots for steak knives.  The block we got is the one now shown in the Amazon add.  Apparently Henckel made a change in their set about the same time I ordered it.  We can live with the substitution though as the knive set is now selling for $50 more than what I paid for it in December 03.  I would have bought the set regardless of the block design but the steak knive slots was a nice feature that appealed to me. The knives are well crafted, have a great feel, extremely sharp and we love them.  There were two extra slots in the block that accomodated another Henckel knife we already owned and one other. We also love the selection of knives, especially the paring knife and small serrated knife. Some other reviewers have mentioned scratches or uneven sharpening but we've not noticed either of these conditions	1
B00018HQB2:stylish:m._munoz	I just got into wine a little while ago, and wanted some nice glasses to sip from at home, rather than just using a plastic or glass tumbler.  But seeing as how I'm anywhere near wine snob status, I didn't want to spend a bunch on a set.	1
B000HGKQUQ:wow_factor!:amateur_party_planner	I bought this chocolate fountain for a 3rd grade class Valentine's Day Party.  It was the talk of the whole school.  The kids loved it.  I used Sephra chocolate (a coupon was included), so I didn't have to mess with adding any oil.  The chocolate fountain worked great and left quite an impression.  The cascading, flowing, chocolate wasn't quite as perfect as the pictures on the box, but it probably would have if I would have added a teenie bit of oil, but the pure Sephra chocolate tasted devine.  I also saved $25.00 by buying the CHP (champaigne color) version	1
B000FFRZ2Q:best_coffee_maker_ever.:anny_o._privett	I have found this to be the best I have ever owned.  My daughter had gotten one and finally my old one conked out and I just had to have a Bunn also.  I envied my daughter's ability to make coffee in literally three minutes.  I used to only have 12-cup capacity pots but there is no need for it now.  The best is that you can always have a "fresh" cup of coffee and it is always hot. It makes a "clean" cup of coffee easily and efficiently.  We are thrilled with this product and highly recommend it anyone and everyone.  This will be our brand of coffee maker forever	1
B000BMAKHU:best_knife_i've_ever_used:genevieve_smith_"bead_gal"	I bought this knife for my daughter for her birthday.  I'm sure she's going to enjoy using it.  I had the occasion to use it at her house after she unwrapped it and found it to be amazing.  It was so well balanced and weighted that when slicing a potato very little pressure had to be applied. Now I just have to get one for myself.  Well, my birthday is coming up in February	1
B00004YTPV:great_for_those_thin_kids,_bad_for_thick!:brad_hunter	Shamu is ready for you to ride him! Be gentle though... he hates rough tubers and riders, he can't withstand heavy duty people on him! If a heavy rider tries to "Inner Tube Giddy-Up" him, he'll be over forced in his body chamber and will POP! BE CAREFUL! Liste	1
B000BIVIGQ:my_pod:a_mom_in_michigan	The My Pod and its filters work great in my Senseo. Now i don't have to buy the expensive pods all the time. The only problem is i have to shut it off manually as it won't sense it is full and shut itself off.	1
B00080Q2OK:nice_:jillian_r._white	I really like these plates.  I bought the crocks as well and have no issues with them.  THe go together really nicely if you are serving soup and salad for dinner guests.  I love the colors and I am happy with my purchase.  The price was attractive as well	1
B000E9WCIU:very_pleased:lisa_sikora_"armywife"	I was very pleased with how quick I received my purchase. I had looked for a long time for Bunny cake pan	1
B000050AP4:only_brand_that_fits:bluesundown	the cheaper ones don't quite fit... unfortunate because these are so expensive...  which is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 stars...  I would give five for the product, but the price really is outrageous...  They know choice is limited so they gouge their own customers (Hamilton Beach, not Amazon)...  too bad the makers of these machines don't have the users in mind, instead of their bank accounts...  They take advantage of people who NEED these humidifiers	1
B00008R9PH:worth_the_money:d._weber	I have two of these in my home and they really help to cut down on smells and dander from our two cats.  And the filters are inexpensive enough to be able to change regularly	1
B000050AOT:life_of_unit:b._thomas_"auntbee51"	I loved my hamilton beach unit and when I got use to the small about of noise that did not bother me.  Dusting was way down and now that my unit has stopped working I notice a big big difference in the dust and my allergies.  I have no idea why it stopped working after only having it for 3 years but it did. Anyone else have this problem	1
B000BU1H5G:great_machine:kathie_lee_"kath"	Nice machine for doing quick clean-ups, stairs and car. A bit heavy but great suction. Not thrilled with the method in which the hose for accessories is hooked up but a small price to pay for a good job. Worth the minor frustration	1
B000CI6FGS:superb_quality:j._sherrill	Our queen mattress is not a pillow top so the fitted sheet is deeper than necessary but it tucks under fine.  Having the elastic around the entire fitted sheet helps with this.  The lace edge needs to be ironed after they come out of the dryer but that only takes a minute.  These sheets have held up well so far and feel great.  If you get the ruby color, make sure you wash them in cold to keep their bright color and prevent color runs.	1
B0000CNQWH:i_absolutely_love_this!:lowkey	When I got this I was a little worried it would be too cheapy b/c the materials are light-weight.  But, I set to putting it together and the directions were VERY easy and all the pieces were there and when I got done I was estatic.  It was just so easy and looked so good! I have a very small laundry closet and it fits perfectly next to my dryer and stands about 3 inches below the top of the dryer and is the exact depth of my dryer. Unlike other reviewers, I find it rolls very well and is not flimsy or wobbly at all.  Maybe they overtightened it and stripped the bolts	1
B00006JL0B:best_coffee_maker_i_have_owned:s._tully_"blah_blah"	I consider this coffee pot to be near perfect.  It has no "auto turn on" feature, but i never use that anyway.  The only thing that takes getting used to is the way the filter holder thing opens, but it soon becomes habit.	1
B0002X1I4M:new_customer:tune_j.	Bought this product with a gift certificate from my children.  I am very satisfied with the bowls.  I give this product a high recommendation	1
B0006G0KR6:good_blades,_nice_feel:j._shinn	I was surprised at the quality of these knives for the price.  I was not prepared to spend a rediculous amount of money on a knife set with a blade for every plausible occasion.  This set has the perfect number of knives and each one feels natural in the hand.	1
B0009R31TG:well_above_5_stars.__the_best_interactive_toy_available.___10_stars:adobe_princess_"laura"	My pug loves this toy better than all the rest of this kind.  He jumps to pull the beas out of the hive.  He squeaks the beas.  Perhaps it is the contrast of the black band and the shape of the bea head.  He went crazy for this toy and got exercise with it.  It is better to play with you dog and hold the hive and have them pull the beas out by their heads.  He likes the wing detail for chewing on.  This toy gives exercise.  I am so glad I tried it.  He plays with the hegehog on his own.  Those are the 2 best toys.  The squirels from the hide a squirel are fun, but the game holder is not something he was really excited about.  These interactive toys are great.  I have never seen such excitement and tail wagging.  He hardly ever wags his tail and he did with this toy and the jumping is great exercise.  This one is the best.  It is well worth $10 for a dog who loves to play.  I get him to stop destroying the house as much with these toys	1
B00022AP1K:loud_but_worth_it:mary_c	I see all the reviews agree - IT IS LOUD - but I love it.	1
B0002PCT0W:a_fine_fan_for_any_purpose:plant_lady_"jann"	This fan is an excellent value for its price.  It gives 3 options for style of air flow nd 3 speeds.  Additionally, it is easy to move the head up and down so that you can either just circulate the air or actually have the air blow at body level.  I bought this fan because my old one had "died" in the middle of a hot summer.  This one filled the bill and is effective in a small to medium sized room.	1
B000GB568O:unbelievably_wonderful.:mrs._beasley_"avid_quilter"	After using my Roomba for a year and loving it, I decided to splurge and buy Scooba.  Wow!  I think I love it even more than my Roomba!  I turn it loose in my large kitchen every couple days and go upstairs and forget about it.  When I return, I have a gorgeous, shiny, clean-smelling floor.  Once a week, I wrap a damp washcloth around my Swiffer mop and go around the edges or my kitchen and deep in the corners--but the rest of the floor is spotless and shiny ALL THE TIME.  Scooba is a miracle.	1
B0007DFTLA:nice_grill_pan:melissa_m._miller	This is my first grill pan and it work very well. I have only cooked chicken on it so far and I have found that I like the way tenders cook better then really thick chicken breasts	1
B000143SZY:just_how_you_want_your_hair_to_look!!!:s._winkler	Ever since my curlers arrived I have been obsessed. I love the curls I get from the larger size. Just roll your hair when you wake up, do your make, eat breakfast, and when your ready to walk out the door just take 30 seconds to pull out the curlers (very painless) and you look like one of the girls on the shampoo commercials. I love this product!!!	1
B00004RFRP:villaware_prima_pizella_baker_primo!:lynn	The pizzelle baker performed very well. The batches of pizzelles were excellent and the recipes included were good. I recommend this pizzelle iron.	1
B00009NRP4:love_the_look,_love_the_toast.:roni_jordan	The English take their toast seriously, and while I don't share their affinity for beans on toast for breakfast, I lusted after this gorgeous piece of appliance art at Williams-Sonoma for years.  About seven years ago, when the dollar was still strong versus the British pound, I bought the 2+2 combi model by mail from a restaurant supplier in the UK for about $100 less than the then-going US price.  While it's a bit dicey fitting thick-cut bagels into the slots (not a big bread item in the UK), I solve the problem by using the sandwich baskets to contain them.  The toasting is even, and I actually the enjoy the old-fashioned timer without pop-up, which keeps the toast warm while the rest of breakfast is being assembled.  Unlike others, I do not unplug it after each use.  Never had a problem.  The crumb tray is terrific, and actually does catch every bit of crumb without a mess.  I've had the $100 Krups and Cuisinart models, which burned out within two years.  This one is made for restaurant use, and I expect it to last a lifetime.  Worth every penny, if you appreciate high-end kitchen appliances and tools	1
B0000CFG1X:great_product_great_company:smartshopperco_"cheryl"	I just want to say I am not sure why the person who lost a piece of the product in her (Dawn Ulepich "Dawnski337" (Illinois)) haste is criticizing the company for a bad product. I have only had one problem ever with a Rival product and when I called the company, they immediately sent a new product out to take care of the problem even though it was not a product problem but rather a handling problem. I have found that they are a more than fair company and will take care of their customers. They probably would have even taken care of replacement of the plastic part (even though she lost it). It is not fair to penalize the store from which it was bought or the company that produced it because of her carelessness	1
B0000VLIV4:the_best_grinder_for_the_best_grind:c._w._smith_"wee_golf"	We have had one of these grinders for over 15 years.  It was always the best and easiest to use.  Simple to change grind size, easy to fill and the side turn gives excellent leverage when grinding.  We broke the top and kept it in place with duct tape - not real pretty.  We were so happy to find the same grinder and now have two	1
B000F7JXM4:food_mill_was_a_good_deal:mikyd	I received the food mill promptly, and in perfect condition. It was as stated by the seller	1
B000K9UQDC:just_what_i_wanted!:winnie	A great ice cream maker. No prefreezing bowls. It is loud so plan your ice cream making accordingly - you will not want to be in the same room as this thing when it is going unless you are already deaf LOL!	1
B0000C88D6:the_filters_are_too_expensive_-_but_it_works.:h._rosser_"hrosser"	I started to order replacement filters at $47.99 (too expensive) - but found the whole machine was on sale for only $49.99 - so I got 3 spare machines. I'll be looking for one with a washable filter before those need replacement.	1
B000063TMB:really_great_measuring_spoons:heardy_vanover	I really bought these measuring spoons to match the Michael Graves measuring cups that I was planning to buy, and I am sure glad that I did.  The are the easiest to use measuring spoons that I have ever used.  The unique handles seem just right.  You can use them equally well with either hand.  It seemed with the dipper type spoons that I previously used I was always changing hands, and the spoon was always in th wrong hand.  With these you can forget that.  You can tell the size of each of them just by looking at them, but I wish that they would have embossed the sizes all a little larger and painted them white.  Black on black is hard to see, especially when the numbers are so small	1
B00007CWFG:great_upgrade__carafe.__no_more_burnt_coffee.:	I bought this as a upgrade from the glass carafe that came with my aroma control machine.  I was tired of burnt coffee due to the burner burning it.  This carafe keeps coffee steaming hot for hours.  A great upgrade	1
B000G27O4M:absolutely_fabulous:mrs._sheila_kravitz	The grinders perform exactly as described.  They are attractive and I would recommend them highly	1
B00004S1B9:sharp_knives,_takes_practice:jhm	I've owned one for five years and my knives are razor sharp. It took me a little practice before I realized I was using it correctly, though. The directions could be better, and the machine doesn't provide any feedback to distinguish proper sharpening. _Cooks Illustrated_ magazine found that they could get knives sharper with this device than with the higher end models	1
B00004SAF7:cork_puller_for_the_weak:robert_c._as_solutions	My 82 year old aunt can now open a wine bottle because the Vacu Vin requires minimal physical strength -- the only I have found that is so easy to use except for bench models	1
B000308C3O:so_far,_so_good!:k.o.	It's still brand new, so everything's working great.  I really love the color; I bought it to match my yellow standmixer.	1
B000CPAV3O:great_stuff:s.__bass_"blackcatmom"	Helps with multi-cat households.  I had one of my cats die and the following month I adopted a rescue.  Naturally, all five of my cats had issues.  The Feliway Diffuser helped reduce their anxiety and fear.  It isn't a cure-all, but it was/is a help.	1
B000FVU4A0:i_hope_i_don't_have_to_return_this_one.:m._naganand_"got_coffee?"	i've had a braun for 7 years which mysteriously developed a leak and was laid to rest.  Replaced it with a $20 MR. Coffee 4 cup from Walmart, which eventually, let water out the front, the back, the side, etc... creating a puddle just like the leaky braun.  Threw that out and went to a 12 cup Hamilton Beach that I had received as a gift.  What a POS... It had a bulky carafe that was difficult to clean and also, the crap leaked as well, and when I lifted it, water fell out the body creating yet another puddle on the floor.  After reading reviews on the Net and countless hours of searching for a good price, i was ready to buy the BUNN stainless steel.  I almost bought the Bodum electric Santos until I read that for some users, the bottom carafe developed a leak and it needed to be modified so that the water heats to the correct temperature.	1
B0001MXU6S:a_great_machine_for_the_office:monika_brenner	Very quick and good coffee as long as you buy the proprietary pods, which can be found on line usually with free shipping	1
B00068K71I:the_best_mice_on_the_market:sarah_harrison	Eeks mice are great! Most catnip mice lose their flavor/smell/attraction for my cats pretty quickly, but my cats still play with an Eeks I've had for over a year. The one drawback is that they don't look too good after being played with (teeth marks, drool stains, ripped-off tails, etc), but cats don't care about that	1
B000ESVI7C:cuisipro_peanut_butter_and_jelly_spreader:c._elementary_school_"ellie"	In our family we give a "mystery" kitchen item each year.  Everyone tries to guess what the item is used for.  This spreader really had the group stumped, someone finally came up with it on the third day, with some minor hints.  Since then my 11 year old has been using it to make sandwiches.  She says it works great, but you need to spread the peanut butter first.  This really is a gift for some one who has everything	1
B0002FCG5K:almost_perfect:m._pence	Look.  I suck at using a normal iron.  But, after reading some reviews decided to try a press out to decrease my dependence on Dry Cleaners.	1
B00006JO11:awesome_little_vacuum_with_lots_of_power:fairview	I was in a second hand store and saw this little vacuum.  Wasnt really looking for a vacuum but plugged it in to test it and was immediately impressed by the suction.  It had some of the best section power I had seen in any vacuum.  So I bought it and have been totally amazed by its capabilities.  Its so light...about nine  pounds and easy to transport and store.  Its power cord is on a reel that retracts into the vacuum at the touch of a button.  The bags are a bit small but its a small vacuum.  They are very easy to get at and change.  Its the best vacuum for hardwood and kitchen floors, along baseboards and on stairways.  Not so good on deep pile carpets although it will do the job in a pinch.  I have three cats and gets lots of hair and dust and its great for a quick vacuuming.  This is a great second vacuum to augments a heavy duty upright.  My vacuum came with two attachments and the crevice tool.  Many third-party vacuum attachments would work with it too.  I am glad I bought it and would recommend it.  Its the vacuum I would use most.  The biggest drawbacks to using a vacuum is the weight and unwinding the cord to use it and then rewinding it and your done.  Push a button and the cord automatically rewinds.  Whats not to like about this vacuum.  Highly recommended	1
B0000E3FXY:the_best_i've_seen!!!:luis_l._schuster_"pipelions"	I don't know about the other reviews that say this knives aren't stainless steel, the labels fall off, or the filet knife breaks, but what it's for sure in my case is that these knifes work great.  I don't go by fanciness nor brandy items... I WANT KNIVES THAT CUT nice and easy, and the Miracle Blade III are the best.	1
B00008JNU1:if_you_only_buy_one_toy_for_your_dog...:sumo's_mom_"sumo's_mom"	This is absolutely, hands down, the best toy we've gotten for our dogs. We own three sets of these in varying sizes. Because the balls are plush, they will wear out- this is not for your destructive chewers. Our dog plays with the colored balls at least 3 hours a day. Before leaving for work, pop a couple of treats inside and you're out the door with less anxiety while they nose out the snacks.	1
B0000DDVR4:great_idea!:renee_m._duguay	This was one of the best buys for the kitchen. I hate brown lettuce, and this makes sure it doesn't turn brown.  You can't beat the price, either!  I recommend this to everyone!	1
B000BKLNGY:better_than_crate_&_barrel:t._lehman	Loved this rug.  I have purchased 5, nicer than the one at Crate & Barrel and at such an affordable price	1
B0000U6PU4:perfect_travel_companion:karen_cawrse_"bestbookshare"	My husband travels to UK frequently and it's hard to find a good cup of coffee there. We've looked everywhere for a portable coffee press that would work in a hotel room in conjunction with a hot water pot. This fills the need completely.	1
B00093024C:the_best!:pat_k.	These are a purchase to go with Wamsutta sheets. My daughter likes extra pillows.	1
B0000AFX4E:simply_the_best:zak_rudy_"muzak"	Here I have a refurbished Palinato X3; textured, very hardy stainless; and a good bargain with no cosmetic flaws, -170 to start (6 mo warranty).	1
B00004UE6M:good_product:m._martinez	This product looks great on my counter and is effective at prolonging the life of my garlic.  Amazingly, it arrived with no breaks or chips despite the fact that it was poorly packed by the manufacturer (just a thin cardboard box with no padding).  The only real gripe I have is that the lid does not sit flush on the top of the keeper.  The hole at the top of the keeper is not perfectly round so the lid sits tilted to one side.  This does not take away from the effectiveness of the product since garlic requires air circulation, but it detracts from its aesthetic qualities - one of the reasons why I picked this particular product in the first place.  If it were not for the flawed lid, I would have given this product a five-star rating.	1
B000CC1ULE:its_a_coat_rack:hlf170	It isn't exaclty what i expected.  But it works.  It looks nice.  And holds a lot of coats and doesn't tip over.  It serves its purpose.  Are there better quality coat racks?  yes.  But for this price, its worth it	1
B0000V6Z12:sweeper_bags:k._murphy	The Electrolux sweeper that uses these bags is very expensive and so are the bags.  If I had known that I could only purchase these online I may have chosen another vacuum system.  But, on the bright side, the sweeper works very well and the bags are not too challenging to put on and remove	1
B000I6NIOG:it_really_works:elmo	Over the years I've tried a good dozen humidifiers.  Worries about bacteria, difficulty in filling up, and difficulty in operation led me to trash them all.	1
B00032HGMU:nice_and_retro:steve_p._fronczek	We received the Zephyr as a wedding gift. Ours is a little newer design than what is shown in the photo. The handle on ours is brass instead of chrome. It heats fast and holds plenty of water for several cups of tea or cup-o-noodle.   Much nicer than some of the higher priced tea kettles out there. My wife and I are very pleased with this tea kettle	1
B0006A03QA:this_is_an_awesome_knife:gb_guitars_"gbroulet"	In Anthoney Bourdain's book "Kitchen Confidential" he talks about how in a real kitchen the chefs don't use Henkle or Wustoff knives, they use Global.  Cat Cora of "American Iron Chef" also uses Global knives.  I needed a good knife in my kitchen so I decided to check out Global as well.	1
B0000AR7VQ:extremely_pleased:w._woolard	This was a gift to my wife for Valentine's Day.  A good friend of hers had one and after she tried it, that's all she wrote! We have been extremely pleased with this unit and would recommend it to anyone considering purchasing one.	1
B000634278:cats_paradise!:annette_d._watts_"totallycharmed"	My cats love this!  They will play with it by themselves or with each other.  It is a little wobbly for my big fat male cat, but he still loves to play on it.	1
B000GFHXEU:love_these!:a._leichtman	These are GREAT! The keep my drinks cold for a VERY long time and are top-rack dishwasher safe!!	1
B00005YXC1:excellent_-_makes_restuarant_quality_rice!!:kevin_k	Just tried it out with some basic jasmine rice from the local supermarket.  It is rice we have prepared numerous times in another (cheaper) brand rice cooker and also have prepared on the stovetop.  The rice that came out of the Zojirushi was absolutely perfect!  As good as any I have had in any local restaurant or on my frequent trips to China.  I was astounded.  None of the crispy brown stuff we had in the other cooker, just perfect plump, fragrant rice.  The countertop stayed clean as well, didn't bubble over with starch water like the other cooker.  Clean up of the cooker was easy.  Top notch, excellent product.  You can't make better rice than what this thing produces	1
B00012F408:sturdy_spatula:albert_zigler_"alzigler"	Sturdy well made spatula. Perfect for use in 12in to 16in woks.  For the price you just can't go wrong	1
B0002AQXTA:totally_silent!:a._r._snyder_"pluperfect"	I love this filter! It keeps the water pristine and more importantly it is easy to assemble and clean thanks to the included double tap valves and media basket.	1
B0000YWF5E:coffee_tastes_as_beautiful_as_this_maker_looks_!_a+:m_m_m	It is a very pretty maker, and coffee is made under perfect conditions.  The price is good through Amazon, just make sure you use suggested filters, the other DO NOT work... (learned from experience).	1
B0001A9TE2:works_pretty_well_...__except:cat_lover	I have three cats and bought this to keep one of them away from my door.  It works very well on two of them but the one I wanted to deter is a Siamese.  If you read the fine print it does state it might not work on some exotics.  It also won't work if your cat has hearing problems.  For all others it is great	1
B000A386PS:my_favorite_knife:alison_hayes	Of all my Global knives I have bought recently, this is my favorite - I just love it. It is very light and so easy to use and has so many uses and especially good for peeling vegetables.  One of my best buys.	1
B0000WT310:excellent_cat_food_and_tastes_good:n._lim	My cat asked me to submit the following review:	1
B0001MRGKE:book_light:a._simms_"mom_of_2"	I bought this Lightwedge for my daughter who is 7. I found out that after I put her to bed, she could not go to sleep right away. She would use a flashlight to do little reading. Well after doing some research this seemed to be the best type of light. It shows right on the page and should be better on the eyes. My only issue is you have to buy to separate sizes. I ordered the paperback size because that is all she is reading but even that size is small because there are different size paperbacks. They should make a retractable light that fits a vary of sizes. But it does do the job	1
B000AV2STA:great_for_the_money:esta_brook_"esta"	I was very happy with the princess comforter, it was plush and soft. My granddaughter was thrilled	1
B00080QK3S:cute_and_functional:nicole_smith	I bought these as I was trying to find my pattern on the internet.  I love them!  They are great in the microwave and they match beautifully.  Perfect for a small dish of ice cream or peaches or to put salsa in for snacking.	1
B0007Y3A8S:the_little_bugger_works!!!__though_not_well_at_first.......:sirluke	I normally don't write reviews... but after owning several toasters in the past, and being very disappointed, I just had to write about this one.  I owned an old Toastmaster 4 slice toaster for about 20 years.  It never did brown evenly, but was a workhorse until finally the bread crumb tray broke.  Got my money's worth.	1
B000C20XWQ:very_nice:beth_c._roman	this is a good pet bed and a bargain for the prize.  Seems to be well made, very puffy, my dog was trying to pound it down before laying on it.  I love the round shape, have always had rectangles but this fits the area better and  seems to provide plenty of laying room for the dog	1
B000G7JX8M:wonderful_item:p._huddleston_"lottakids"	No more water rings - what more could you want?  Keeps drinks cold for hours	1
B000BX49C6:_cotton_steen_duvet:thomas_j._christiano		1
B0000CAQAE:great_bowls:hsmath	These bowls have been in my home for a few years now.  We have used them for cereal in the morning for warming up food in the microwave.  They are nice looking and very functional.  When we needed another bowl when one broke, we knew we would get another fiestaware bowl	1
B0000DDVO3:perfection!:love_shopping	This product is perfect for keeping pots and pans from scratching our new stainless steel sink. Rubber feet are great for protecting the sink as well	1
B00005AM7X:great_starting_set:	I recently purchased this set after spending several weeks trying to decide which set was right for me.  Not a chef, just a regular guy who likes to cook.  I looked at several competators and decided that, for the price, this set was the best one out there.  I've had the opportunity to use most of the knives at this point and I find that they keep their edge very well and are extraordinarily easy to clean up.  They have a nice heft to them and the handles seem to be just the right size.  The only drawback that I see is that I would have preferred an 8&quot; chefs knife instead of the 6&quot; that comes with the set.  Overall excellent for the price and an absolutely sufficient set for novice	1
B000A5CL3Y:wow--gorgeous_dishes!:kelli_hamilton	I ordered this china specifically to use during the holidays.  It arrived in perfect condition with all pieces accounted for, and is absolutely lovely. The red and gold combination can be used year-round, and it is dishwasher safe!  I like it so much I intend to order another service for 8.  Excellent value	1
B00077JFLG:it's_perfect:julie_jennings	The stool fits under my kitchen table and is easy to move around. I bought this stool for my 3 year old grandson, he pulls it up to the sink when he wants to get a drink of water and he sits on it when he eats his lunch. He loved mine so I bought him one of his own	1
B0007KITT2:queen_12"_with_5"_of_therapeutic_memory_foam_mattress:r._kuschner_"brewman2"	It's pretty comfortable, but what new mattress isn't? The foam-memory material takes a little getting used to. I generally prefer a very firm mattress, and had to get used to the "sinking-in" feeling. I've also found you can't really use a lot of pillows.	1
B0009ZA9TI:$12.99_is_a_great_price_:dwight	I need a tablecloth and this was the cheapest price PLUS 6 napkins.  Both packets arrived  dirty with many hanging threads and I threw them straight into the washer. They are 55% cotton and 45% polyster so they came out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I am very happy with these basic table linens.  I like the price too.	1
B0000CFMAX:food_scale:mary_brown_"dabsgram"	This scale is quite accurate and easy to read.  The only problem may be that it can be a little touchy when trying to adjust the needle in order to use a different container	1
B0000ULC48:love_it,_but_have_some_problems.:j._levin_"hannahbears_mom"	I love my spice rack, don't get me wrong--I mounted it under my cabinet to increase storage space in my tiny kitchen.  Unfortunately, sometimes when I spin it (gently, as always) the entire rack comes off and falls apart!  The spices go everywhere and creates a mess--not to mention wastes spices.  I had it come off twice in one week.  It happens if we spin it clockwise or counter clockwise--there is no way to 'lock' it into place, it sits in a channel, but is not locked.  So, look out when you spin, or put your other hand underneath it to steady it.	1
B000BI8P4E:best_deal_around:dan_blankenship_"author_of_the_suspense_novel_the_running_girl_(exposing_the_spiritual_war_against_christianity)"	Looking for a great armless chair?  You just found it.  This is an affordable chair, a comfortable chair, and a chair that is easy to assemble.	1
B000ILFRI6:your_closet_will_finally_be_perfectly_neat_and_everything_will_fit_in_it!:intelligenceisparamount	This item saves space because it folds everything to the same size.  It is god's gift to those of us who have small closets and hate messes.  I first saw it when a clerk at a store was using it to put clothes back on the floor for sale.  I tried to buy it off her and she told me the name of the company.  I LOVE the flip-fold.  You won't be sorry if you buy this item	1
B0006590AA:without_a_doubt,_the_best,_easiest_corkscrew_you_will_ever_use!:beth_cholette_"doctor_beth"	Being a wine lover, I've used all kinds of corkscrews, from your basic twist model to the kind with the "wings" to the two-pronged kind. Finally, I received the Screwpull as a gift, and my search for the perfect corkscrew came to an end! As others have said, the Screwpull effortlessly lifts the cork up, so there's no actual "pulling" whatsoever--all you do is simiply turn the easy-to-use lever at the top of the device. In almost 10 years of usage, the Screwpull has never failed to easily and cleanly remove a cork; on the rare occasions when it had trouble removing the cork on the first try (probably because I started too close to the edge), simply starting over solved the problem. Spend a little more money to buy the Screwpull, and you'll never need to buy another corkscrew again; highly recommended	1
B000CN6Z0E:great_product_for_the_price:faye_langhoff	This sheet is great.  Feels great, looks great, and feels good to the skin.  Glad I bought it and the price was great	1
B000FELBKO:hide_a_squirrel_dog_toy:k._ayres	My dog loves this toy.  She especially loves for us to hide treats inside it.  She will find a way to remove the treats without taking any of the squirrels out	1
B00005Q5IJ:not_pretty,_but_works_well:bippy_the_beardless	There isn't much you can say about a sharpening steel. It sharpens well, and is extremely fine for keeping already sharp blades at their sharpest. The handle is ugly gray plastic, but it seems solidly put together, and is easy to work with	1
B0000DJBNI:great_skillet:happy_cook	Immediately became my favorite skillet.  Cooks evenly, cleans up easily.  Only wish it also came in the 12" size	1
B0000DJ27A:cleans_the_air_efficiently:erich_habich	I purchased the smallest version, the LW 14, for the purpose of cleaning the air in a small kitchen without windows.	1
B00013K8P8:best_fit_for_my_husband:jean	My husband loves cereal for breakfast, and I bought it so he doesn't have to go to the pantry every morning to get a box of cereal. It was a perfect fit for him, and it even accommodates the extra large cereal bowl that he uses. I was surprised at how big it was, but the stainless steel frame is incredibly beautiful. The rubber turn knob doesn't jam up as easily as I expected, although dense cereal may require a bit more effort to dispense. Only complaints: 1. The top plastic covers are not completely airtight, but are fine for dry cereal. 2. The bottom rubber covers fall out easily - they should fit more snugly	1
B000G0QP8K:like_a_nice_piece_of_furniture:t._angelo	Very well made and far more attractive than a wire cage or plastic crate, this pen is a great option for keeping a larger pet in the living room.  Our dog - a rescued Border Collie - is incontinent, so she cannot roam around the house.  And while she prefers being outdoors, with this great looking pen she can now spend quality time inside, in the same room as her family (instead of out back in the mud room, where her old wire cage was)	1
B000E26HHO:excellent_machine_for_the_price:cr	I recently upgraded to this machine.  I had an antique White that only sewed straight and zigzag...imagine my pleasure at having a machine that can make 48 different stitches!  I'm very happy with the product - you can't go wrong with a Singer product	1
B00004RFN0:wonderful_knives!:	These are great knives, especially for the price.  They are just like the Pro-S line from Henckels only are not hardened the same way.  They are sharp.  The chefs knife sliced a very ripe tomato straight out of the box.  They have excellent weight and balance and the handles are comfortable.  All in all, a great buy!  I can't believe I used dull knives for some many years when these wonderful and affordable knives were so accessible.  Definitely worth their weight in gold	1
B0001VQIHW:muffin_rings_-_ring_true:robert_a._greene_"crumpet_maker"	The price was excellent. Ordering was quick and easy.  Delivery was prompt.  The high quality of the muffin rings was matched by their performance in the kitchen. They performed flawlessly on my electric griddle.	1
B0007CXQRK:frequent_washer:e._krausz_"the_book_maven"	The product is everything as described plus. It stores alot of laundry, and wheels easy	1
B000BGJ1GC:best_fogless_mirror_i_have_ever_owned:david_d._van_rheenen	I've gone through several fogless mirrors in the last 20 years and this one is simply the best.  I owned one before made by Z fogless and could not find a replacement when it was broken.  I had tried many other brands and found them to cloud up soon after I got them.  The Z Fogless is the best shower mirror and the price beat all the competition including ebay	1
B000056JNU:kidco_gate_installation_kit:d._kolk	We recently purchased this kit to install on the top and bottom stairs with a kidco gate.  It was very easy to install, its very sturdy and we did not have to drill any holes into our banister.  We would definately recommend it to everyone	1
B000FBWYH6:not_your_mother's_corelle:catty	I have  really nice Dansk everyday dishes, but needed something lightweight and less breakable for frequent outdoor use. I have to admit, these dishes are really stylish! They look great on the table, are very lightweight, stack very compactly and are a nice large size. The only thing keeping me from giving these dishes a 5 star rating is the bowls. They are small, and while they look really cool, the squareness makes them hard to get a spoon around. If you're looking for bigger bowls for cereal, you could easily fill in your set with the standard white bowls that Corelle makes. For salads, the square ones work just fine. A word of pricing caution: On Amazon at this moment they are $69 a set. I bought mine for $49 per set at my local Walmart	1
B00006JKZQ:it_works_great:kenneth_elliott_"mack"	After reading some of the previous reviews about shipping damage I almost didn't order it.  However, it arrived in great shape and the packing material was excellent.  Someone must have gotten Sanyo's attention on the quality of their packing material	1
B0002PCD1M::d:c._bedell	I looove this mug. Its such a beautiful shade of red, very nice looking. Also, these mugs are huge. One of mine already has a chip on it, but I'll leave that to certain people in my house being very clumsy.	1
B00006WNRX:fast,_user_friendly:joseph_j._gnatek	Works just fine for my needs ... I use it to press my 'wrinkle-free' Dockers. The water container for the steam is a bit awkward to fill . . . but once it is filled it lasts a good long time.  Heavy duty, well-constructed , dependable unit.  First package 'disappeared' at UPS.  When they shipped the first machine, it was evidently damaged and returned back to Amazon by UPS. (probably due to the thin cardboard used for packing)  The replacement shipment arrived just fine, and, as always Amazon customer service very helpful on shipping replacement while first package was still 'lost'	1
B000KV7ZGQ:entertaining!:scout_r._"scout"	Just a word of advice:  If your dog is used to playing tug of war with a rope they will easily pick this toy up.  If they aren't, it probably is not the toy for your dog.	1
B0002DHZTY:filters:anatole_gutowski	Best price I have ever seen for this product, and free shipping to boot!	1
B0006NHUU4:handy_and_versatile:a._m._doyle	I received this as a Christmas gift.  I've used it to carry wine to parties and even onto an airplane.  I had a tote large enough for this to fit into when it contained two bottles.  I found that it is just enough protection to keep the bottles fron clinking without adding extra weight when you're flying. It's the best way I've ever known for carrying wine bottles anywhere	1
B00067P764:like_it:marmar	I really like having this. It's odor free and easy to use. Yes, you have to empty the bags and that takes time, but it's worth it. I have found refills at walmart, petsmart and petco. So they haven't been hard to find	1
B000215J8K:super!:lynn_f.	It is hard to find spoons for tall drinks. These are excellent quality- nice heft and good looking as well. Highly recommend	1
B0000B0HRU:great_wine_tower!:barbara_parker	I just received this wine tower the other day.  It looks as wonderful in my home as it does in the picture.  It's perfect for our needs and takes up so little space.  The ONLY complaint I have, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, it was a pain for my husband to put together.  Also, it came with 2 bottom shelves, instead of one bottom and one top...he had to improvise until I can get this corrected with the manufacturer. (Fortunately, it's not noticeable)In spite of this, I recommend this wine tower for anyone wanting an expensive looking wine tower that is so space efficient at this price.  I've already gotten compliments on it from friends.	1
B0006GMID0:nice_item_:e._billman_"stormbringer"	Overall this is a very nice item. I have been using it to make Mojitos and it works wonderfully. The only negative thing I have to say about it is the handle could be longer.	1
B00005B5ZZ:reconditioned_kitchen_5-quart_mixer:oklahoma_homemaker	I am very pleased with this mixer.  It is just as I requested. Received in excellent condition.  The performance reaches all of my expectations in a KitchenAid appliance.	1
B00066XUUK:love_this_piece:melissa_dellett	We have been looking for a reasonable priced armoire for a while.  This piece is very sturdy and adds so much elegance to our living room.  The instructions for assembly were easy to follow, however it did take my husband and I about 4 hours to put it together. It is well worth the time and money we put into it. I love it!!!	1
B0009JKGTM:a_tried_and_true_classic:jen_sb_"rabble_rouser"	Fiestaware ROCKS!  The turquoise place setting is beautiful...It is much brighter than the pictures on amazon.com...Fiestaware is functional, calssic and fun- I love to mix and match the colors and the 5 piece place settings are great for this.  I highly recommend mixing and matching Fiestaware. I mix up colors that you wouldn't normally expect to go together and they usually look great	1
B000A3J4JA:very_handy!:bradley_ashley	This is a great product.  Very quick to heat and I enjoy the dettachable base feature.  The Cons include a limited amount to pour water into the unit (the lid doesn't pop up very far) and some of the finish doesn't do great with steam.  Overall a good buy	1
B00006IFR9:no_problems:lori_a._pfeifer	I received this set packed very well, no scratches, no broken pieces so I have NO complaints. The color is beautiful and the dishes are durable.	1
B000F9AXR6:lou_buckner:glenn_l._buckner_"louise_buckner"	I recommend this product. It is excellent quality. Very quiet when running and has lots of power	1
B0002MR0AO:great_oversized_towels:k._duffy	For the price these bath sheets are great! Very soft and plush. Exactly what I was expecting	1
B000CKMVE6:small_but_efficient:nagtatampisaw_"tagatanod"	I like the fact that it included diff sized containers, and 2 of those were tumblers with handles to boot. I have read reviews where people have burned out their motors, and I will have to say that, yes, it's possible, but only if you didn't follow the directions. The manual indicated a recommended time of usage so you should be patient, expect to shake things up once in a while between blends, and this unit should last you at least a year :D I think some people have the wrong expectation that you can just turn on the switch and leave the unit alone to do it's thang. Gee, if that was the case, I'd let my car drive me on auto pilot.	1
B00005NANS:great_for_heavy_use:louis_s._toth	I am a sous chef and I use this knife to break down everything from shell steak to veal chops, and I love it.  I also like the flexibility of the blade.  It holds an edge very well, with minimum touch ups.  Overall I am very happy with the Wusthof line.	1
B0001KO9RE:great_machine,_but_spend_the_extra_money_to_get_the_gaggia_evolution:jordan_griesshaber	I have only had it for a few days, but moving up from a Krups Pump system with only 1050W of heating, this unit rocks!	1
B0000CF8N6:uniquely_useful_little_crockpot_--_consider_its_possibilities!:claresmom_"claresmom"	This is a lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful for a number of purposes. I've owned larger crockpots for a couple decades (currently a 6 quart Rival Smartcooker is my mainstay for preparing family-size meals), but the larger pots take up a significant amount of counter space & aren't at all useful for heating or re-heating small quantities. This little crockpot, however, is perfect for heating or re-heating 2-4 servings of soup or stew. I originally bought it, however, because it is *absolutely perfect* for making hot cereal on cold mornings, especially those hot cereals that require more than a few minutes of cooking in the microwave or on the stovetop, such as steel-cut oatmeal (try the nutty goodness of traditional steel-cut oatmeal once (also available here at Amazon) & you're unlikely ever to return to instant or "quick cook" oatmeal again). There is nothing nicer on a cold winter morning than walking into the kitchen & knowing that a healthy, delicious hot breakfast is awaiting you. From mid-October to late-March, virtually every night I prepare my entire family's hot breakfast cereal for the next morning in this little crockpot, with no more effort than is required to make single serving of instant oatmeal or cream of wheat in the microwave.	1
B00006RTXN:great_gift_for_everyone:	I bought this exact same slicer 20 years ago for my mom and it has lasted.  It's a unique item that guests love and it's easy to clean up as well	1
B0000DKHIC:good_value:invictus	Heats well and quiet.  Does not blow heat very forcefully but certainly warms sufficiently given enough time using the oscillation function.  Appears solidly built with good warranty	1
B00008R9PG:hamilton_beach_seems_to_be_doing_it's_job:holly_sutton	I love the different speeds it offers. I have found it to be really cleaning the Dust from the room.So far so goo	1
1295	If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine. National Review is for people who sympathize with Christian jihadists and white supremacists. Wouldn't want to be in that camp if I were you.  Read Time, Mother Jones, The Nation, or the American Prospect instead.	0
7098	Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it	0
7455	I found this magazine very unrealistic in terms of fashion (not clothing you would actually see people wearing on a daily basis and definitely not clothing that most people can afford).  The whole magazine is one big ad.  If I wanted that, I could just turn on the tv	0
8377	This magazine is great just for keeping the spirit. It's filled with many success stories. But hardly any of those success stories include the details that led them into success. It's also extremely geared towards franchising. Every other article, and every other ad is about franchising. I have a one year subscription and at this point I'm bored. I'll keep the subscription, but it's highly unlikely that I will renew next year.	0
10246	I ordered Star magazine in late December 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords. She stopped receiving it in June, well before her 12 month subscription expired.	0

11427	I received my first "issue" of Modern Bride in the mail yesterday.  It was just the cover of the magazine, nothing else!	0
13511	Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.  Us Weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses.  I'm not buying their story or the magazine again	0
14817	I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE EVEN ONE ISSUE. I LOOKED ON THE IN TOUCH MAGAZINE SIGHT AND IT SAID THAT I HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED 6 ISSUES. I WILL NEVER ORDER A MAGAZINE SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH THIS COMPANY OR THROUGH AMAZON AGAIN	0

21241	I was looking forward to another Oprah magazine with great joy.  Unfortunately, the pomp and circumstance within "O at Home"'s pages is a real turnoff for me, an average, middle-class American living, as they say in "middle America".	0
23869	I echo the same gripe that other reviewers have voiced here: The magazine covers the same handful of people week after week after boring week.  How many times is a reader going to see no talents such as Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, the Tom Cruise-Katie Holmes joke, and THE most overrated, overhyped people of all time Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie on the cover and not get tired of it?	0
25954	I'm sure that this review isn't unique.  Spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover, not to mention the ridiculous articles written within. By the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound' I've completely forgotten the point of thier article.  They must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing. They sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com. I'm sure that i've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin.  Next time you see it on the stands, I suggest you spin in another direction	0
26665	I subscribed in late May to MaximumPC and PCGamer. Early July I started getting PCGamer.  Still nothing from MaximumPC.  I called customer service and they said they had recieved my order June 2nd and to expect my first issue in late September. Thats nearly four months! That is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form. I gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine. But at a $8.99 news stand price it is too expensive... so I am left with the choice of spending almost $35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts (more than the subscription itself) or just missing out on those issue.  Very poor customer service.	0
26980	This magazine is all puff-- if you're looking for honest and insightful reviews, this is not your read.  However, if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them, this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue	0
31707	This was a gift for my daughter. Instead of receiving the New Yorker, she is receiving People. You need to fix this	0
32427	The amazon ad said next day shipping. Took over a month for the first magazine to arrive.	0
32434	Oh Lord!! Does anyone still read this?? I was a subscriber back in the early 70's,when it was a folded up, newspaper.By and large, Jann Wenner let people run it, that knew how to. It is now, and has been nothing more than an Ad choked,gossiping Teen slick.Right, like they are the ones with the money!! I wonder what they still pay Raoul Duke, to do??!! Ralph Gleason has to be turning over in the grave	0
33709	I subscibe to this magazine.  Will not renew it either!  Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical.  It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount	0
37621	The recipes included are good, but this is not a "cooking" magazine. This is a women's fitness magazine in disguise. While I am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness, it shouldn't advertise itself as a cooking magazine. There is way too much other junk. If I wanted a makeover or an exercise routine, I don't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that.	0
38917	For some strange reason, I began receiving this magazine in the mail. Never ordered. Never paid for. My conclusion based on reading the last three issues: You're kidding me. How can Time Inc. still publish this rag? What's the point	0
42573	Wasn't worth the subscription. I found the magazine to be bland, full of ads and basically boring. All the information can be found doing a quick web search. Highly Disappointed	0
43909	I have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational. Recently I have subscribed to Shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer. Its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks !!!!	0
45556	I was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction, short stories, essays, book reviews, and literary criticism. Instead I received a magazine that discusses political issues. Does the magazine know what it wants to be? They recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands. Why would they if they're becoming a political magazine?  Do they want to be a news/political magazines such as Time, U.S. News & World Report, and Newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine?	0
47414	While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past. Instead, I was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. Another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing.	0
48529	I first subscribed to GQ when it was still a quarterly...an issue only every 3 months.  Back then it was primarily a men's fashion magazine.  It was sophisticated, useful and classy filled with clothing men could actually wear and practical grooming tips, trends and style.  I suppose in many ways it resembled a Ralph Lauren print ad. Now fashion is relegated to a few pages in the back of the magazine with men wearing things they seem to have found at a local flea market.  Nothing seems to fit properly, patterns - plaids - stripes...anything goes.  It resembles homeless couture.  Odds and ends that nobody should actually wear.  Sure the world has changed.  But fashion, good taste, and quality are timeless despite tweaking and contemporary preferences.  The editors may feel that grunge, hopeless edginess for it's own sake and adolescent sloppiness sell issues.  But they might be surprised that there's a huge pent up demand for sophistication and real style, both formal and relaxed.  I hope someone else picks up the torch.	0
55551	I hate this magazine.  I subscribed sight-unseen based on the good reviews, and find the recipes are for food that no one in my house would ever eat...way too exotic.  If you like good ol' American fare, don't buy this one	0
57174	The writing seems to have come from under-educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool.  I wasn't sure if I was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles.  This magazine isn't for men, it's for boys.	0
60627	dO not order MENtle floss Magazin.  it preetends to be sMart but It's just a teaz.  Covers intersting toppics, aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng.  Each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu.  whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself?  Like ths revue, it dosn't live upto it's claims.	0
61038	I subscribed to BHG from their website and ended up subscribing to an additional year.  The articles are helpful to a degree but the layout of this magazine, with its overwhelming amount of advertising, takes away from any good points.  I've found the style to be choppy and very difficult to read because of the ads.  It's hard to tell how long an article is or where it starts.  I rarely find anything I'd want to save.  Overall a disappointment	0
63557	First off, I'm a huge geek.  I love programming and computers and the internet.  You'd think Wired would be like some great magazine for me.  But the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this "bad" stuff in the world, it makes you sick.  For every cool article about Japanese robots, you have to wade through like 10 articles about "how America is doomed".  Whatever...  they need to man up	0
63720	Regardless of the quality of the magazine, it is really annoying to see Oprah on every single cover! and to make it worst, she does not pick "regular Oprah shots", instead you look at every issue's front cover and ask yourself "How did they take that picture? She doesn't even look like her!" It's as if Oprah is telling all of us "See how I can look like?" Every month is just a new testimony from Oprah, that money does do wonders.	0
64157	While I rarely subscribe to magazines, I was looking for something to motivate me to exercise and so I signed up for a one year subscription to Shape. Before and during college I was a ballet dancer, but after entering the real, 9-5 working world half a year ago, exercise time became more difficult to find. Unfortunately, I found that Shape magazine was not really about exercise at all. It was about beauty products, fancy new-age spas and resorts, and trendy workout accessories. I was also shocked by the models on the magazine's covers and pages. Not only were they skinny but they usually sported next to nothing. I finally cancelled my subscription when a magazine came with a woman in a see-through, lacy top on the front of it, visible nipples and all. Workout wear? I think not! Trust me, the woman belonged in a porn magazine, not my exercise magazine	0
66450	Order placed early June. First issue of subscription not yet received. This is service	0
67834	Bad journalism and plenty of adds....if you like to exoticize Black people then this is your mag.....Nothing to be gained here except maybe the cost	0
70889	The heft and page quality of this magazine is impressive, but it's mostly advertising.  Very disappointing.  It does have some useful info and I do enjoy reading it (which is why it got 2 stars from me), but I definitely won't be renewing my subscription	0
70931	I TRASHED THE ISSUE WHEN I SAW THE SHOT OF TRASHY PARIS HILTON.  THERE IS ENOUGH NUDITY ALREADY IN YOUR PUBLICATION AND SEEING THAT SAD PIECE OF WORK (HER) ON THE COVER JUST TURNED ME OFF COMPLETELY.  SORRY YOU THOUGHT HER 'COVER WORTHY'.  PROBABLY MISSED SOME FINE ARTICLES.  SINCERELY: DEANE EVERETT	0
73391	I've subscripted to Gourmet for years but I let my subscription run out.  The lifestyle articles keep pushing out the recipies.  As I read through food magazines I dog-ear the page with a recipe I want to try.  In the last year there were very few dog-eared pages and it wasn't worth continuing the subscription	0
80911	The editor's gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid Lifestyle magazine, which you'll enjoy only if you're like her -- rich, creepily entitled, self-absorbed, and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining, but not really food or actual cooking itself.	0
81939	Cook's Illustrated is the first cooking magazine that I'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover, even though they DO insert advertisements for their own products, which I suppose, to them, makes this an "ad-free" magazine, but I'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. The one time I found it necessary to contact Cook's Illustrated about a customer service issue, I was simply floored by the treatment that I received... I'll simply leave it at that.	0
83138	This magazine seems most interested in promoting books, etc. that it has a financial interest in--most notably lately the South Beach Diet. Prevention and it's website are now full of misleading banner ads promoting irresponsible dieting techniques and fads.  Too bad, because more than ever nowadays we could use a nice little magazine about nutrition, weight loss, exercise and natural remedies that isn't influenced by it's publishing partners and advertisers. Skip this one, and try Self or Health for a more well-rounded look at women's heath needs	0
86550	I was looking forward to a magazine that took a good look at different subjects than those covered in the mainstream media. What I received was a manual on how to think the "right" way. I've never delved deeply into politically labeling myself, but I vaguely considered myself a liberal. Man, was I wrong. Clearly, liberal means much the same as the demonized "conservative". This magazine has a single viewpoint, that of an ultraliberal ex-hippie who has found themselves wealthy in the 21st century. It is full of articles about "finding meaning" and "reassessing life" that seem to have been written by folks who drive Chevy Suburbans and pay too much for a cup of coffee. The magazine gives off a strong smell of covert superiority, and it made me nauseous	0
90272	There was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking, tolerance, and openness to healthy, civil debate.	0
90715	As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia	0
93341	This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription	0
96485	articles weren't anything new. mostly fluff and cosmetic/clothes ads. better info and exercises in Oxygen and Women's M&F.	0
96728	I picked up an issue of this magazine last week because I wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser. After I got it home, I opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine I have ever seen. The articles read like something from "Teen Beat", yet it's filled with adult material. There were about 10 articles on "how to please your man" and "what guys like" and even a "sex workout". These articles didn't contain any "real" advice--just unintelligent babble. For instance, did any of you know that guys don't like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex? HMMM, crazy.	0
97159	I have to agree with those who didn't care for it. the only thing I liked was one article written by a Dad who was skateboarding with his son. It was witty, insightful and inspirational. the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life. It is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes. Does anyone do that? I don't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money. the few issues I read made me mad and depressed. I've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine. Give me break with that $400 cashmere hoodie for my son! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters. He is not a reflection of my style, he is a reflection of his own. Get over yourselves	0
98646	This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.	0
100002	I subscribe to the online edition you can receive through email in PDF form. I was looking forward to reading reviews of the latest audiobooks and hearing what the reviewers thought about them. Frankly I was disappointed. The reviews are little more than 1 paragraph plot synopsis, (the same info which might be gleaned from looking up the title on amazon.com or reading the back of the book). Reviewers add about 1 sentence or so to the title and call it a review... Please. They are also fairly out of date. Most of the audio titles reviewed are older titles which have been out for a while. Some titles aren't available anywhere that I can figure. Whats the point in reviewing an audio title you can't find?	0
103081	Change can be good; however, sometimes change can be very bad.  Earlier this year PC Mag decided to become a magazine for the masses instead of providing technical information for their longtime dedicated readers.  Before the change this was a magazine that I would keep for a year or so to refer back to the content; now I can skim it in 5 minutes and don't feel there is a reason to keep it for any length of time.  As a longtime subscriber (20 years) I will not be re-subscribing to the magazine.  I wish them luck, but I believe they have lost sight of their subscription base and are chasing a broader base of subscribers that might disappoint them	0
103087	I just cancelled my subscription and recommended that my daughter cancel the one I bought for my 14 year-old grandson.  For some reason Ziff-Davis marketers think that  full page ads selling sex videos are appropiate for PC magazine. (Dec 27, 2005, p 122 if you want to check it out).  Previous issues had partial page ads selling "sex pheremones" which I could almost overlook, but full pages scantily clad lap dancers is over the line.	0
105254	I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.  I'm also very unimpressed with their Cat Channel online board they advertise in Cat Fancy and cannot recommend it to others.  They seem to have poor management of their online board especially on weekends so inappropriate posts stay there for a long time and a professional magazine advertising their own online board in their magazine should have their online board perfected before offering it.  Also Cat Fancy pushes a ridiculous high renewal rate for their magazine, but if you go onto Amazon, you can get a renewal rate of almost half the Cat Fancy renewal price.  So I have come to the conclusion that between the Cat Fancy magazine, their poor online Cat Channel board and the high renewal rate Cat Fancy charges, they are not interested in keeping their readers or online members.	0
105278	TIME has long been increasingly superficial in its news coverage, and recent years have only accelerated this trend.  In the 60s and 70s, it was a somewhat serious magazine with a centrist bend (originally it was considered quite conservative), but as the years go by it's degenerated into more and more pop-culture fluff with little substance.	0
115770	It took four months to arrive and by then I was moving...	0
122110	I ordered this magazine thru Amazon three months ago, and STILL haven't received a single issue.  I've emailed their subscription department to no avail.  They have my money, but i don't have a magazine	0
126415	I have received this magazine from it's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies, however, the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service.  I have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right.  I have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer.  If you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them	0
132108	It is a shame but the reviewer that made the comment that this magazine does not have any balanced view of what is serious world news and what is fluff hit the nail on the head. It skims the surface and is 'pop'.	0
139767	I ordered Kiplingers and US News on March 25 and was immediately charged for both subscriptions.  Today is October 12th and I've never received US News.  I've complained several times and been given a variety of excuses and promised a refund and free subsciption which of course I haven't received.  When I requested a refund of course I was given the wrong amount.  If you want to order magazines I agree with the last reviewer go to another site because while Amazon is great for books that haven't got the magazine business straight.  Also, the customer service phone numbers are wrong and this is a total mess.	0
144187	Admittedly, I am slightly older than the "Relevant" demographic.  But I'm not 40 yet!  So there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me.  And I applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues.	0
149306	Do NOT!! Order from this website! I purchased a subscription for Oxygen magazine on Jan. 30, 2006, and I still have not received the first issue. I am very dissapointed, to say the least!	0
153263	!!!!!!!!!!DONT BUY!!!!	0
163278	I thought I detected some deterioration in the quality of Discover Magazine in recent months, so I went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion. Indeed they have. Sad.	0
168049	I was so excited to receive my first issue of Art In America, and I was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in Europe.  There are very few articles or artist Bios.  The photos are beautiful, but don't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about American artists or galleries	0
189692	I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine.	0
192366	This was kind of an impulse buy for me and I didn't get what I thought I would get. I thought it would be a clear and concise magazine on what is up and coming in TV and the Movies. Instead I got indepth ramblings on actors and directors. If you want to pick up a magazine and find out what is coming up without fluff and filler...this is not the mag for you.	0
194607	This magazine shows the negative side of black men. I find the magazine an embarrasement to the African-American community. It seems out of all the races of men in the world, black men seem to want to display their lack of self control, their love of  fancy cars, overpriced clothes, which in no way helps create wealth in our communities. And I am also offended that this magazine rarely shows black women on the front cover. Until, black men understand that this kind of pathetic display of supposed masculinity is stopped, they will always be stopped by the police, be passed over for employment, and looked down upon. I wish someone would create a magazine for black men which shows the positive side of being a black man such as being leaders in their community, showing respect and love for their women, and showing that everything is not hip hip!	0
198536	I subscribed to this magazine in January for my husband.  It took 5 months to get the first magazine, then I never recieved another one	0
205858	This magazine used to be very thorough, and it used to be very good at providing me with TONS of deals and tips that I never would have found on my own. It was great, and very opinionated. But last year sometime, they changed the look of it and now there's a lot less text. It's much more a style magazine now, and that's not what I want in a travel magazine that I have bought to tell me about money saving! Worse, except for the 40 Best Vacation Bargains, which are still okay, most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest I do expensive things. Since when is a $225 a night hotel considered budget?? The headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky.  It's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be! I noticed that Arthur Frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe is why--bring him back! My search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again	0
213402	Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue	0
224364	I ordered HOW for a graphic designer friend's birthday in January and it is near the end of March and she still has not received anything...	0
230580	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines I have read: motortrend, car and driver, automobile mag, sport compact.  I don't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars.  Car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny	0
234603	My family received this magazine for years, but recently we have decided not to re-new our subscription. This used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue. At this point, nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements--this isn't the real science magazine it claims to be, and is a waste of money.	0
240875	Truly this is the magazine of the warmongers, the neocons, who would gladly repopulate America completely with non-Europeans, except for the neocons themselves and their cohorts, who are of  "a race of the mind," as one wag put it, by and large.	0
251985	This is one of the worse magazines I have picked up in years.  If you have "money to burn" traveling, then it might be for you.  Loaded with advertising and little 'true' content	0
261661	I would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn't worthy of its title. I subscribed before reading review, I was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read, though some stories are interesting I'm sure I'd be able to find them in other magazines like Vogue or Cosmo. and there is plenty of ads, probably more than stories. And much like other reviewers When I first ordered it, it took forever for the first issue to arrive, now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	0
262146	A Great Magazine.  I had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago.  I paid $104 for the 2 year subscription back then, but suddenly the price in the US has skyrocketed astronomically.	0
288852	Where are the critiques? The articles lack any critical substance. Whoever is hot at the moment will get their behind kissed. It doesn't matter that the album is usually not worth all the hype, VIBE will go along with the flow. On top of that, there are more ADs now than ever before. Even articles that could have been decent are cut down to a page or so for the sake of saving advertising space.	0
296747	I bought the magazin on november, and I don't recive it yet	0
306944	I found Cat Fancy Magazine to be mostly advertisements and breeders advertisements than real meat of information for cat owners.

310250	I made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen. I received a very good offer to subscribe, that I didn't want to turn down. I thought this was going to be like a Better Homes and Gardens, or Country Living but it wasn't. This appears to be a good choice for design professionals. I was just not very impressed	0
312532	I ordered Star magazine in late December 2003 for my elderly homebound mother who loves the crosswords. She stopped receiving it in June, well before her 12 month subscription expired.	0
314934	I have been subscribing to US Weekly for about a year and a half. In that time, I have never seen an issue without several pages of Jessica Simpson. I have to wonder; does Jessica donate money to this magazine? She seems to dominate the whole magazine, each and every week.	0
322892	I purchased a subscription as a gift last Feb. and the recipient never recieved it! Instead they got a gift certificate from Amazon and a vague explanation..	0
328334	I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.	0
328643	it would be nice if i were writing about the magazine CONTENT here but since i never received a single copy of my subscription.all i can say is their customer service  SUCKS !!!! after repeated attempts to correct the delivery address or find out what happened the issue still hasn't been resolved.	0
331588	As a practicing photographer and not a collector, I've been very disappointed with B&W on the few occasions it's crossed my desk (I've never had a subscription, so I'm basing this on just the few issues I've seen).	0
334783	Kissinger, Honorary Chairman of The National Interest, was going to head-up the 9/11 Whitewash Commission, but he begged off when families objected.  Dov Zakheim, the 2.3 trillion dollar missing and unaccounted for Pentagon funds Man, is on the journal's board.  One is better off reading Commentary Magazine, where at least  the "Neocon fascist madmen" (in Web Tarpley's phrase) state their case in clearer and more honest - if that's the word - prose.	0
338365	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star.	0
338792	I have received this magazine from it's start and have always found it to be full of great recipies, however, the company that produces this magazine has horrible customer service.  I have battled with them for over a year about a billing mistake on their part and they still have yet to make it right.  I have cancelled all subscriptions with them and refuse to do business with them any longer.  If you subscribe be very cautious about ordering any books from them	0
347540	I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.	0

353095	This magazine recently (April 05) featured what they felt were the 100 greatest movie moments of all time.  Number 1 was the sing-along scene from MAGNOLIA.  Other moments in the top 10 included the credits from AUSTIN POWERS 3 and one of Eugene Levy's quotes from AMERICAN PIE.  Keep in mind, these are the 100 greatest movie moments of ALL TIME.	0
357815	I have been a subscriber to CGW for almost 10 years.  Sadly, I have to end the subscription now.  It was a very good magazine; but no more.  One reason is that more than half of the magazine are now ads.  The second reason is that the size of the magazine is getting smaller and smaller with the layout that is getting very hard to read.  And the reviews are bad. The reviews don't have a professional kind of feel anymore.  I can't totally blame the magazine. A big part is due to the gaming industry.  There is no good game anymore.  They are all FPS and MMORPG.  Just how many time you can review the same type of games?	0
359439	I would agree with previous reviewers, in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read.  The number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles.  It is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads (possibly 50% or higher) pitch ultra high end products, such as Viking ranges, BMW's, Oceanna Cruises, trips to Bora Bora...WTF? Although I do enjoy I a luxury meal, I don't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling.  Ocassionally, behind the clutter, I find a useful recipe; I rarely find an interesting article.	0
363529	I got this magazine for a year and a half before I had to quit my subscription recently. I liked all the fashion tips and articles on how to dress for your body size and style, and that is why I subscribed to begin with. But I was not expecting the bombardment of amoral opinions forced on me. (not to mention an overload of advertising- which you will get in most fashion magazines anyway, so that's not a complaint). Sure there was a few lines here and there that were nonbiased (telling the facts of STDs and such), but 90% of the articles on sex, were opinion and not fact. Girls today are having sex with anyone and getting hurt emotionally and physically because of magazines like Seventeen who say that sex is good if you're ready (What 15 year old girl is ready to have sex and get an STD or a baby?? Please.), and that condoms are 100% effective. They are not, but that's what most teen girls believe because of stupid magazines like this. They need to take advice from their parents and doctors, not magazine articles. I was disgusted at the opinions presented as truth to basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences.	0
365893	This is a good magazine for the home cook that wants to branch-out from the standard Family Circle or Good Housekeeping  no risk recipes.	0
366723	I started my first subscription to this one in 1980-81. It was EXCELLENT!! It had all kinds of great advice and help on real issues relating to "preventing" ailments/conditions.  Now it's a little advertising manual for drug users and fad dieters!  Wow...what a change now. I'm not interested in "paying" to read ads. I'll get my motivation and information on more reliable sources.  Besides, I got tired of all the little order forms that kept falling out on my lap while I rode the stationery bike!  What a waste of trees. :	0
368782	How people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me. All the usual suspects are found through out it's pages. This rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for: Polictal correctness, anti-capitalists, anti-gobalisers etc With all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head. What's more the 'ideas' you'll find here have been tried, tested and more importantly failed. Ah well... some people are just too easy to fool	0
373467	This is the worst magazine I have ever subscribed too.  I hated it so much after the first issue that when new ones came, I thru it right in the trash.  Here why:	0
376131	Occasionally when I go to the grocery store I pick up a magazine by the check out counter. So I bought an issue of Fitness magazine and then decided to get a subscription. I don't know what the heck I was thinking. Each time I got the issue I noticed there was always some skinny blond chick on the cover wearing a bikini.  There were NEVER any women of color on the cover. So when I was sent a letter, asking if I'd like to renew my subscription, I said he11 no. I'm not wasting my money on a so-called fitness magazine that doesn't feature women of color on its cover. There's just no way. I thought fitness was for everybody, not just for skinny blondes who wear bikinis. And just because your skinny doesn't make you `fit' either. Skip this if possible	0
376586	I have to agree with those who didn't care for it. the only thing I liked was one article written by a Dad who was skateboarding with his son. It was witty, insightful and inspirational. the rest of the mag just seemed totally irrelevent to my life. It is aimed at people who dry-clean their childrens clothes. Does anyone do that? I don't want my kids to be that concerned with clothes and money. the few issues I read made me mad and depressed. I've never written a review before but felt compelled to do so regarding this lame magazine. Give me break with that $400 cashmere hoodie for my son! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts and that is what matters. He is not a reflection of my style, he is a reflection of his own. Get over yourselves	0
377824	This magazine is just page after page of Hollywood P.R. agencies releases. Unbelievable. Why didn't I think of it? I know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources, but other than a few pages of VERY subjective movie/music/book reviews, this magazine just re-writes and prints Hollywood press release after Hollywood press release again and again and again. This magazine must not have a staff of writers, but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes. The funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by, say, Tom Cruise's management company/major film studio/hired PR flak fawning over Cruise or his newest movie - and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever, sassy, wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks. Uh, okay - wait, didn't you get the press release? If you Tivo EXTRA and have the theme to Entertainment Tonight as your ringtone, this magazine is right up your alley. Otherwise, don't waste a penny on this nonsense.	0

382473	If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine. National Review is for people who sympathize with Christian jihadists and white supremacists. Wouldn't want to be in that camp if I were you.  Read Time, Mother Jones, The Nation, or the American Prospect instead.	0
389793	Self what? The entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page. Their product placements went from "convenient and subtle" to obviously pandering to their revenue sources. Plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain couldn't relate. I once enjoyed Self and their monthly self-help plans. Their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing	0
394427	For years Discover was the best magazine for the lay person or even scientists who wanted to keep track of the trends in other fields of science. Now with a new publisher it has become almost worthless. Very superficial articles are mixed with over blown headlines and poor science. After buying Discover since it's very inception I find it sad what has happened to this magazine. Check the dates and notice the glowing reviews for the old magazine but pay attention to the negative ones from the last 6 months	0
401646	I subscribed in late May to MaximumPC and PCGamer. Early July I started getting PCGamer.  Still nothing from MaximumPC.  I called customer service and they said they had recieved my order June 2nd and to expect my first issue in late September. Thats nearly four months! That is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form. I gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine. But at a $8.99 news stand price it is too expensive... so I am left with the choice of spending almost $35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts (more than the subscription itself) or just missing out on those issue.  Very poor customer service.	0
403754	I was told this magazine was good to look at for design ideas. It isn't really, and there isn't really that much to this magazine.  It is just another tired old AOLTimeWarner publication, just like Time, People, or Teen People.  I looked at the August and September issues and the only things in those two that impressed me were the features on Elton John's Out of Africa fundraiser and the article on Julian McMahon.  The rest of it was ads, and not the classy type ads that make the advertising tolerable in Vogue magazine, but the same old ads you'll see anywhere else, and they are annoying.  There were several nonsense fashion articles with the likes of Kelly Ripa (post excessive Photoshop airbrushing tools-one of my professors would call it "plastic person syndrome") Mark Consuelos, waay too much on Jennifer Garner and her baby, and other weird things, such as the trend of designer cupcakes.  I wish I was kidding on the latter, but I am not, nor do I have $25 to spend on a glorified cupcake just because it is Jessica Alba's favorite.  There was entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because the stars do it that way in here.  Despite the size of this magazine, there is very little to sink ones teeth into, just way too many photos of the same old same old, and tips for mimicking them.  I am NOT interested in becoming a Teri Hatcher clone, nor am I interested in seeing Vanessa Carlton's pad.  This magazine is for you if you like excessive ads, no diversity, a subscription that is actually not a year (it says that special issues count as regular issues in the magazine) and your life's ambition is to try a cupcake from a bakery in New York because some celebrity did.  This magazine is mediocre at best, and the worst part is, it has the exact same fashion advice as Vogue.  I went with Vogue because there is substance in their magazine, and the ads are classy and very chic.  Leave this one behind-it looks to me like another brain fluff read from the folks at AOL Time Warner.	0
405679	Anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine, as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed, are often given bad reviews.  Its all pretentious pop-culture drivel for the conformist, weak-willed mainstream American.	0
406066	Our library has just finished its magazine usage count, and to my surprise the American Spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits, measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues. And yet our patronage here is very conservative. Perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all, or maybe, as a couple of reviewers suggested, with Bill Clinton out of office, it no longer has the same appeal.	0
417362	Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10. This magazine is an embarrassment in every angle. It is full of pictures of "sexy" boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear. And pictures is all there is, for you that think there will be something interesting to read, read this: THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS MAGAZINE TO READ!!! The latest issue contains of 48 (forty-eight) pages before you get to this issues contents. The first "article" starts on page 126 (!) and is about "why a man would like to slice of his testicles"! Totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text (letters that forms sentences) on about 40 of them. Besides this, the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not.	0
427509	As a member of a Southern family who treasured this magazine, it is with a heavy heart and a sense of loss that I have decided not to renew my subscription this year.  Yes, I've always given the brides in our family a subscription as a gift, and waited eagerly for my issue to come in the mail.  But those days are past.  Southern Living Magazine has been offered to all states for some time now, and I believe this has caused the editors to try to appeal to a broader readership.  This, in turn, has changed the recipe section into something one can find in any other magazine.  Honestly, I do love all sorts of different cuisines, but in a magazine called "Southern Living", I expect to find wonderful and traditional Southern recipes!  This magazine needs to go back to it's roots.  From now on, I'll be giving new brides a subscription to Southern Lady Magazine, and that's what I'll be reading myself!  I will miss the Christmas book, though.	0
428600	Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter.	0
428758	I can not review something that i have not received.  I thought I would have received my first issue by now but have not.	0
431763	I ordered this magazine as a gift for my brother almost 5 months ago and he still has not received an issue. I cannot get a straight answer from anyone about what is happening and I have not even been able to get my money back.  I would not recommend anyone wasting their money with this magazine unless they can find a legitimate web site to get it from.	0
433763	A self absorbed mag that likes to pat itself on the back for feeling pity for the lower 'folks.' They named Cindy Sheehan in their January 2006 Best of the Best issue for 'best stand!' They are so diluded they think that 'nut'is making an honorable stand-only by using her son's honorable death to serve her ego! Secondly, open the edition Tom Ford and you will be discusted with his self-gloating, and sexist photography of women. I don't mind nude pictures, but he only uses women-like sex objects. Reese Witherspoon (highest paid actress in Hollywood) is showed holding a doll by it's arm with an empty stare into the lens.the men are portrayed in sexual positions with the women, and the African actors portrayed are dressed in animal skins!Revolting	0
437221	I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it.	0
438161	I was one of Entertainment Weekly's charter subscribers way back in 1990. It started out great -- a different, intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage. But financially, things were shaky, so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience. I couldn't blame the editors. It helped them reach the needed tipping point, and they gained their needed mass audience. EW remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus, and I kept resubscribing.	0
447471	This magazine might be good if you were wealthy enough not to have to work, had time to work out four hours a day, had your own chef, could go on vacation six months out of the year, or could afford (or cared) about fashion. Otherwise don't bother. They sometimes have a decent or interesting article but they are so few and far between it is not worth it	0
447734	I've been a People subscriber for 2 years now & I quite agree with the majority of reviewers... Same Celebrities, different week. If it isn't Tomkat/kitten, it's Branjelina or Benifer 2. Oh, and we cannot forget "Mrs. Oops, I Did It Again" Spears-Federline. Very little on real people/human interest stories anymore, very little...	0
457315	The reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight, but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be's of true cultural wits like Mencken and Updike. Some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns, and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable. I'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag, and save your money to buy books that nourish you.	0
460416	AWFUL!!!  This is just page after page after page of ads for grotesque jewelry - mostly gaudy watches and necklace sets - and clothing.  There were two "articles" at the very end of the magazine, and they were awful.  One, on Christmas in the English countryside, should have been beautiful.  Instead, it contained just a few pics and very little text.  What a disappointment.	0
463660	the articles are "good" but the articles are wordy and doesnt get to the point. Too many annoying ads. If u want something to "read" this isnt the magazine for yo	0
466523	I subscribed to Modern Bride as a gift to my fiance.  Aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription, I only received about 3 issues total.  Months went by without anything being delivered.  While customer service at Modern Bride was very accomodating and helpful, nothing happens immediately.  When planning a wedding, each and every month is precious.  Especially during the initial stages of wedding planning.  To have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting.  Plus, by this time most of the wedding details were finalized, the magazines I received became useless.  If you're under 12 months to your wedding date, you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with Modern Bride	0
468987	Okay, so In Touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is: A glossy tabloid.  But just when you didn't think it was possible for the American tabloid press to dumb down any further, along came In Touch Weekly and US Weekly.	0
469945	I subscribed to Forbes magazine for a year or two, and in general the content is good, but I cancelled my subscription for 3 reasons. (A) 33% of the pages are ALL advertisements - what a waste of space, (B) every magazine has 3 or 4 renewal postcards that fall out onto the floor as I read the magazine, and (B) the classifieds in the back are "not of interest" to any real business person. If you don't mind the ads and the fluff, then this magazine might be right for you! It's not for me. I give it 2 stars	0
471188	Home Business Magazine is a publication aimed at those members of the general populace who either already own a home based business or who have an active interest in the subject and would like to pursue it further. This magazine contains articles relating to all facets of home business ownership from the initial setup all the way through to the payment of taxes at year end.	0
473119	Have a one year subscription to this magazine and will not renew it. Simply because its vulgar materialism to the extreme.  They say we Americans are obese in body, but magazines like this show to many are also obese when it comes to materialism.  Page after page of glossy ads for things we do NOT need.  And rooms to full of what amounts to dust collections.  Sure they make pretty pictures, but who wants all that 'junk' that probably has no real sentimental value but is more what someone else has told us we need to feel whole or successful.  I recommend the magazine Dwell which has a more holistic approach to a place to live that also wont mean hours cleaning.  For someone who professes to be so concerned about the down trodden, Oprah would do better to set a better example of living simply. And how many homes does one American need, when so many Americans cannot afford even one	0
475191	People magazine is one of the worst expressions of American life.  Instead of makiing our own lives more meaningful and exciting - which is possible - People encourages us to oogle and fixate over people who are essentially images, people we will never meet, and in many cases people who have very little going for them. Does anyone really think that Britney Spears has anything to say about anything, or that Paris Hilton is barely  aware of her own existence?  Does it ever make a whit of difference to your life how many times J.Lo is engaged (in order to get on the cover of another magazine) or who Demi Moore is grinding with today or where Gweyneth gets her gowns	0
477445	This magazine is all puff-- if you're looking for honest and insightful reviews, this is not your read.  However, if you already know all the artists they profile and just like pretty pictures of them, this magazine is worth buying for the sampler disc included with every issue	0
482165	I subscibe to this magazine.  Will not renew it either!  Maybe I am too old to appreciate this periodical.  It is way overpriced even with the Amazom, and others discount	0
491942	While waiting for my daughter in an orthodontic office last month (July 2005), I read through what I thought would be the familiar Redbook magazine of the past. Instead, I was shocked to come across a new sexual advice section in which the explicit techniques for giving your man satisfying oral sex without tiring yourself out was described. Another article within this section explained how a taller man can have sex with a shorter female partner while both standing.	0
496155	not nearly as appealing as the other magazines I have read: motortrend, car and driver, automobile mag, sport compact.  I don't like any of the long racing articles and anything on old cars.  Car and drivers off topic articles tend to be more interesting and occasionally very funny	0
500488	The National Enquirer has gone off the deep end and beyond the point of common decency.  To now attack a sweet, wonderful, charitable guy like Clay Aiken is very very sad.  To go after celebrities whose lifestyles are sensationalized is one thing, but to go after a quiet humble guy like Clay is another.  And now what? Is he supposed to justify their existence and have to defend this garbage.  Their story is ludicrous and they owe Clay, his family, and all of his fans a big apology.  I will not buy this filthy rag or any American Media products ever again	0
502064	...because that's all this magazine is: an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who aren't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet.	0
504907	A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated.  This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants.  There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine.  What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.	0
509518	Unfortunately, there seemed to be no recourse after I ordered this for 2 newphews as a Christmas gift, and it did not arrive.

523115	I would like to classify myself as a moderate but I probably lean conservative.  Because of that, I subscribed to Harpers so that I could read good writing that would challenge my beliefs and stretch my mind in new ways.  I got that, more or less, at first, but over the course of a couple of years the magazine drifted further and further to a leftist propaganda screed, the worst of which was Louis Lapham's bitter drivel editorials.  It got to a point where the writing was incredibly predictable; I knew exactly what position (read:  left of Pelosi) the writer--any writer in Harpers--would take on whatever the issue was, and I had a pretty good idea of what the line of whining would be.	0
524677	DO NOT BUY THIS MAGAZINE! FOR ANY PRICE, IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE. MARIE CLAIRE HAS HARASSED ME REPEATEDLY TO PAY FOR MY SUBSCRIPTION.  IT WAS PAID FOR IN ADVANCE THRU AMAZON. I HAVE SENT THEM COPIES OF MY AMAZON RECEIPT TWICE.  THEY ARE REPORTING ME TO A CREDIT AGENCY FOR NON-PAYMENT.  AVOID THEM, AVOID THEM.  THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS AND WILL FALSELY AND WITH MALICE DESTROY YOUR CREDIT RATING.	0
528222	I subscribed to T+L for one year.  My wife and I found the magazine to be uninformative and of little value when planning our travels.  Most of the magazine seems to be centered around places to go shopping and the photos that accompany the articles are artistic photos, usually of models wearing $1,000 outfits, instead of informative photos of the resorts or hotels.  The recommended travel products tend to focus on $1,200 designer duffels which, while perhaps within reach of the target demographic, are unlikely to survive many trips through a major airport.	0
532828	This magazine took a radical change in direction earlier this year, meaning most reviews prior to April 2006 are essentially reviewing a different magazine.	0
534117	I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad.	0
539493	My biz partner and I were excited to receive our first mag from this group.  We were sorely disappointed.  Most of the articles are not new information, but &quot;rehashed&quot; info widely available.  We read it cover to cover for about 4 months, then cancelled the subscription.  There are better sources out there and this is not one of them!	0
542832	I would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn't worthy of its title. I subscribed before reading review, I was hoping to find an affordable psychology-based read, though some stories are interesting I'm sure I'd be able to find them in other magazines like Vogue or Cosmo. and there is plenty of ads, probably more than stories. And much like other reviewers When I first ordered it, it took forever for the first issue to arrive, now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course	0
543485	A Great Magazine.  I had a subscription for 2 years that ended about 6-8 months ago.  I paid $104 for the 2 year subscription back then, but suddenly the price in the US has skyrocketed astronomically.	0

593314	[...] I got a choice of a free subscription to either Parents or Child magazine. Since I already got Parents, I chose Child. I will not be renewing when my free subscription is up. The magazine is boring, the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages. If you want a magazine about parenting/kids, go with Parents.	0
599799	I ordered this magazine a year ago, and my nephew still haven't receive a single magazine!  Every time I email customer service they would tell me that it's coming next month.  I will let you how the magazine is when I get it, but don't hold your breath.	0
604113	If you're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on. There is nothing of substance in Cosmopolitan. Open the latest issue and you will find "sex tips that will drive your man crazy!!!" and "snag that cutie!!" galore. It's pathetic. And sophomoric.	0
B00006AMTB:waiting_five_months_now_for_subscription:dean_emmerson_"outback47"	Great magazine but beware of subscriptions.  My subscription was paid for back in August '06 and I have yet to see a copy (January '07).  Their customer service have assured me twice that they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives.  Plus, the phone number they provided is not in service!  Its a shame because the magazine looks to be really well done	0
B00007AVYI:sometimes_incorrect_and_totally_biased._:terrence	this magazine is almost as bad as consumer reports. their comparison tests never adhere to their thesis about what the tests is measureing, for example a comparison test is said to be about quick acceleration and on point handling and then the car with the lack lust performance in handling and acceleration would be #1 in ranking. often, the car reviews are always mentioning information about a car that isn't relevant, or doesn't make sense, or the review isn't consistent with the posted viehicle stats. the magazine also seems to be biased. some vehicles are criticized with more irrelevant information than others to say its awful. after further reading of many issues, you would think they are playing favortism towards certain brands or recieving kick backs from manufacturers, for example, you will always see the domestic brand being referred to as basically "trash" and a japanese brand or a BMW is always the way to go, when once again the posted stats and sometimes photos say different.this is more noticeable when you can predict the out come of their reviews. ultimately, its a bad guide towards getting any  information on automobiles period. its the pat robertson of auto magazines. if it were possible, i woudln't even give this magazine 1 star.	0
B00005R8BL:good_for_ideas,_but_not_for_"how_to"_information:joe_"joe"	If you are looking to do major renovation work in rooms of an older house, then this magazine will give you some ideas, before and after pictures, etc.  There is precious little about minor jobs, improvements and fixes you may make on an older house.  There is a lot of showcasing new and expensive top of the line stuff.   My needs are more simple.  I want information on fixing and improving things in my house.  I am not a professional contractor.  For the major stuff, I will hire someone.   I have subscribed for three years but find that there is only one or two pages in each issue that can help me.  Their TV show "Ask this old house" is much more informative.  For magazines, I am going to try "Family Handyman" magazine instead.	0
B00070Q2VE:buyer_beware!:*_"eepeak"	I ordered and paid in full (through Amazon) for a gift subscription to Vogue Kitting last Christmas, 2005. The recipient never received a single issue and was treated very poorly when she phoned to inquire on more than on occasion.	0
B00006KFYB:no_content,_no_sense_of_style:nyc_design	This magazine seems to exist solely to promote their advertisers and their products. Their articles focus heavily on their sponsors and the ads far outweigh what little content there is. When they do focus on the best work of the design community, their examples are puzzling. They choose work that is often genuinely awful, and you rarely see any of the work that wins awards in other publications and award shows (ComArts, ADC, Graphis, AIGA, One Club).  While that would be admirable had they found other good work, most of the work they highlight is mediocre at best. There is a reason this magazine is free	0

B00006LCVJ:way_too_kiddy:shanti_r._"effervescent_adolescent"	I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!! There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens	0
B000066T1E:the_used_car_salesman_approach:richard_b._haines_"raincity"	The magazine is not bad, marginal at best. To my surprise, I am now a member of a club. I also was surprised to receive the first of a series of gardening books (mine to keep for a small fee).	0
B000060MKK:maxim_for_motorcycles:jonathon_d._owen	This magazine is published by the same people that brought us Maxim.  So if you like Maxim, check it out.  If you don't: pass.  The pictures are slick, models are attractive, but there is little in the way of information on how to do it yourself or what was actually done to the bike.  It is basically a picture book.  If you are looking for technical articles, how tos or performance installs; check out Road Bike for metrics or Hot Bike or American Iron for Harleys and Victory's	0
B000BVEET6:watch_out!:novel_reader_"novel_reader"	The magazine does have good information, but not for a child...it's more geared to an adult.  Watch out though!  They like to send you notices of collection if you do not renew the magazine when your subscription is up	0
B00006KMH4:amazon_gave_publisher_wrong_address,_did_not_receive:b._miller	This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines.	0
B000060MLD:no_good_patterns_-_ever:mirriam_bristow	I have about two to three years of Knit N Style (2001 - 2003)Magazines, and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a Cardigan Pattern to Knit for myself.  I haven't found a single one.  All of the patterns have serious faults: Drop Shoulders, (totally unacceptable) little or no armhole, neck and/or shoulder shaping. Most sleeves have little or no cap. And, worst of all, they are all made in five or more pieces. Haven't any of these &quot;designers&quot; heard of Elizabeth Zimmerman?  I was going to give the lot to the library, but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place.  If you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people, why don't you teach them the PROPER way to knit?  Young people are smarter than you think	0
B000K0YFVU:haven't_received_it_yet!:ronald_sankary_"ron_sankary"	I have not received the magazine yet and my daughter is pissed	0
B00005NINB:and_horrible_customer_service:c._weaver_"psychodoc"	So I'm mostly with other folks on the content.  If you get lucky, the small sampling of product reviews will include some item you're looking at (or should), and the anemic review will prompt you to follow up at the manufacturers website.  The "Buyer's Guide" was of decent breadth and useless depth on the bikes.  No bikes from Gary Fisher, the inventor of mountain biking.  Huh?  I'm primarily interested in MTB and the issues of Mountain Bike are good.  But, you only get 4 issues, and the content is redundant between the two magazines (or even within each mag).  For instance, the May MTB issue had a story on rebuilding trails in Los Alamos (I actually really like their reviews of specific places), and the cover also boasted a "Great American Trail Guide."   One of the FOUR trails talked about in this "Great American..Guide":  Los Alamos.  I can spot a cut and paste job when I see one.  Also in that issue "The Bike that Started a Revolution" about the Sp Stumpjumper.  A great idea for an interesting article that was butchered into a condescending comic strip.  Also, having ordered the mag for the issues of MTB, I was disappointed when they didn't even show up.  Emails with customer service resulted in one of the more disappointing "did you not read my email" type exchanges.  Two months later, and I now have one of the two missing issues in hand.  They have great photography, and I have yet to find a better option, but I'm really disappointed.  I won't renew	0
B00005N7UN:beginers_only:"oddwoods"	This overpriced magazine is for the weekend warriors who would like to start a new hobby. There is nothing wrong with this, we all started somewhere. However, one can only stand for so much of new tool ratings and how to build the same old challege-less pieces of furniture. Please don't waste your money. Try Fine Woodworking, woodworking, or even Popular woodworking. You will be greatful you did, and will be on the road to becoming an expert weekend warriors	0
B000K0YFRY:not_quite_as_informational_as_the_phone_book,_and_less_entertaining:melissa_adler	I'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is. There's nothing wrong with celebrity mags, but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially, it's about as deep as an E! True Hollywood Story about Kato Kaelin. I've tried many times, but alas, this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it	0
B00005N7S2:image_vs._content:j._scully	I'm not sure who's at the helm of this operation but I'd be willing to bet they don't get Outside too often. Not to be too cynical about it, but I just don't find this mag to be as USEFUL as it was before. If you like LOTS of articles on who the coolest extreme sports stars are, how they got their abs, and what gear they're wearing, subscribe NOW. The magazine looks amazing, the photography is top notch and they still manage to come up with a thorny article on the environment periodically. But for my money, it just feels like the editorial staff has been plucked from New York image mags that do one thing really well - SELL. I read National Geographic Adventure, and unlike Outside, I USE IT for information because it has CONTENT	0

B0007RNI5K:mostly_junk,_of_very_limited_interest--buy_a_copy_first:vintner_"vintner"	I made the mistake of subscribing to Make, based on the hype.  It turns out to be long and tedious, with instructions on how to make really messy junk of virtually no interest or use.  Successive issues have gone down hill, and by issue 4 they were dealing in vanity pictures of people's garage workshops.  Maybe you'll be the one in a million who wants to make useless junk, but buy a copy or two at the newstand before you subscribe.  It's not obviously wonderful	0

Unfortunately, it is in Italian which is not mentioned in the details on amazon. they offered  to refund the remaining subscription but the first issue cost me $25. Unless you can read italian and are very patient, I would pass on this periodical.	0

B00006KGD6:very_slow_to_get_first_issue...:samuel_finnessey_jr._"still_waiting"	I ordered Hamptons Magazine through Amazon.com back in October 2004.  I am still waiting for my first issue to arrive.	0
B000EU1H3U:a_lot_of_ads,_little_substance:a._miller	I'm very disappointed with this magazine.  It seems to be a total waste of money.  I found one article that was somewhat helpful and sometimes 2-3 pictures in each issue that give me some style ideas, but it's not worth the money or my time digging through it trying to find something I can use.	0
B000BT4GD2:glossy_and_lackluster:c._ogram	If you don't tend to care about writing, then this would be the magazine for you.  Save your pennies and indulge on something else maybe	0
B00006KOMK:mountain_bike_advertising?:sirpyrosapien_"rich"	I'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated. Sure it's an O.K. magazine, if you like immersing yourself in hype, marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language. Admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn. I just cannot read any of the articles. Chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme' language. I don't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary' or 'amazing' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers. They ceaselessly use vapid 'technical' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech, but is nothing more than marketing spew.	0
B00007AZ96:just_canceled_my_3rd_2-year_subcription:e._bonnell	I used to love Light & Tasty, then they decided to change the look and format, even though reader surveys said keep it the same.  The new look is hard to read, and lacks the down-home feel that makes the magazines popular.  There are less pictures of the finished dishes, and the pictures they do show are smaller.  They added full page ads for thier country store products, which goes against the no ad promise.  I have subscribed for years, but this new look is horrible.  Get it at the store to see if you like it first	0
B000K0YFPG:save_your_money_for_a_different_magazine:sierra_tompson	I started ordering Glamour 2 months ago, and honestly it is a huge disappointment to me. There are so many ads in this magazine its unbelievable. Ladies, my advice is to save your money for a different magazine..I dont recommend Glamour at all.	0
B00005N7Y4:over-rated:	Where's the content in this magazine.  ADs...ads...ads.  They try and make themselves out to be a great golf travel magazine, but I have seen much better in other publications.  I agree with the woman from England...Links loads up on these inserts.  I like to read a magazine like The Golfer, where they travel all over the world and review spectacular courses from the Carribbean to New Zealand	0
B00006L0D8:if_i_could_i'd_give_-10_stars...:	What is it with these gossip magazines?? Please tell me, because I truly think NO ONE in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage. All it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds, while not having anything important else in the magazine. Unless your 10 years old, do NOT subscribe to this. There are better magazines out there fortunately, like Seventeen and CosmoGIRL! which aren't nearly as filled with garbage like this. The reason you don't see J-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people, it's for little kids and it's not mature. PERIOD.	0
B00006L0D8:loved_it...when_i_was_nine.:i_am_the_pinky_lifter_"cindy"	I must say that I've read just about every teen magazine on the market, and this is by far the worst one I've ever read. However, at this point in my life, everything appears superficial and immature.	0
B000066SZT:irrelevant_to_hispanic_culture:midwestern_mom	This is just like the English version but in Spanish. The content does not reflect the culture or morals of the general Latino people. Nearly all models (especially on the cover) are white and/or American and are very thin and tall. They try to use photos of American celebrities when they have brown hair, for example Christina Aguilera, Mandy Moore, Angelina Jolie or just natural brunettes like Catherine Zeta-Jones. Maybe Cosmo thinks we're too ignorant and can be easily fooled by the dark hair dye job or the computer generated tans. There are tons of beautiful and succesful Latinas that could easily be placed on the covers but I think they'd rather just use the same photos that they already took for their English-version magazines. The ads are also for high-end American and European products. I've bought this magazine in Mexico and while it still has the same problems at least they feature real Mexicans and Mexican products in some of the ads.	0
B00005N7U0:they_didn't_follow_through_with_subscription:b._bodnar	We paid for a 12 month subscription and I got the magazine for about 4 months. I couldn't get anyone to answer why it stopped and basically they just took my money. I didn't get a 12 month subscription. I got ripped off.	0

2543	SAVEUR has been a guilty pleasure for me for some time. Guilty because it is hard to take serious a magazine with such a hoity sounding name... and admittedly some of the travel-and-food stories are just on the edge of self-indulgent, self-concious behaviour. They laugh at me at home (or used to) for reading it.	1
4222	I subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and Southern Accents is the best, bar none.  The houses featured are absolutely dreamy--the photography is gorgeous--and while the magazine doesn't offer how-to decorating ideas, there is so much inspiration.  I find it to be intelligently written...which is rare in a decorating magazine. The articles on antiques are particularly informative.  This magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful, classic design--whether or not you live in the South	1
8372	I have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my 2 cents.  Yes, the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities.  But this is exactly something I want to read and evaluate, the marketplace of business opportunities.  Many of these are franchise opportunities, which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start.  The articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful, but not all.  The value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process.  It was not until I read the E-Myth Revisited that I understood the value of these franchises.  This magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy.  The magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise.  Hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there	1
10508	I THOUGHT MY FIRST ISSUE OF YOUR MAGAZINE WAS A LITTLE SPARSE. IT WAS A VERY THIN ISSUE. THE MODELS WERE BEAUTIFUL. THIS WAS GOOD.BUT YOU KNOWIF YOU WOULD INCLUDE MORE IN DEPTH ARTICLESSUCH AS REALLY IN DEPTH STUFF ABOUT SKIN AND HAIR. LIKE I SAID BEFORE AGING SKIN NEEDS MORE DONE TO IT AND SOME THINGS LIKE MICRO-DERMABRASION COULD BE HELPFUL. ALSO 8 GLASSES A WATER A DAY IS THE MOST HELPFUL THING A WOMAN COULD DO FOR HERSELF. BESIDE PLASTIC SURGERY,THERES NOT MUCH FOR THEM TO DO. BUT I WILL SAYTHIS, TO ENLARGE LIPS I PUT A VITAMIN E CAPSULE ON MY LIPS, AND THEN HONEY AND THEN A GOOD LIP MOISTURIZER AND LEAVE IT ON OVERNIGHT. IT DOEES MAKE THE LIPS PLUMPER. ALSO I USE BABY POWDER ON MY FACE AS A FACE POWDER. SOMETIMES I USE THIS JUST ON MY NOSE AND CHIN. SOMETIMES I USE HALF MAYONAISE AND  CONDITIONER AND MIX THEM TOGETHER TO MAKE THE MAYONAISE SMELL BETTER ON THE HAIR. SOMETIMES I USE VITAMIN OIL IN MY BATH WATER SUCH AS VITAMIN E A PERSON CAN BUY THIS AT THE DOLLAR STORE.  IM NOT RICH BUT I DO SOME THINGS TO HELP THE WAY I LOOK AT  MY AGE. THEN YOU COULD INCLUDE PICTURES OF MOUNTAINS AND RIVERS AND STORIES OF PEOPLE .  THEN YOU COULD HAVE ARTICLES ON CELEBRITIES LIKE FRANK CONVERSE,ROBERT BLAKE,REALLY INTERESTING ONES LIKE THAT. PAUL NEWMAN HAS ALWAYS GOT SOMETHING TO SAY INTERESTING. ALSO WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO ACTOR RICHARD HATCH WHO STARRED IN THE HITCHHIKERS?  someone told  me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner. i didnt see that as i should. i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived .i like brad pitt and those people are always great. i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions.angelina jolie i   really like too beacause women do like these women. i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him. yes there is people like that still in the world. ive found some of them. well thank you	1
11206	I have been a faithful subscriber for approximately 10 years.  This is the magazine that impatiently wait for every month.  It has beauty tips, interesting articles, fitness information, etc.  I even gave my mother a gift subscription.  It's the best	1
12236	This magazine does a great job of featuring good articles at the beginning and then breaking down events you might want to do in New York City that week. The magazine is organized into various categories that are color coded so that when you get it, you can just skip to the section you're interested in. There's a whole city out there to discover and TONY can help point you in the right direction	1
13519	I am a huge Nelson fan and thought I was the only one left; until I visited their website www.thenelsonbrothers.com. They are as hot as ever! Since "After the Rain" they have released six more Cd's. I highly recommend the "Brother Harmony" Cd, or the "Like Father Like Sons" Cd, where they honor their late great father, Rick Nelson, by bringing back his music.	1
16230	Conde Nast Traveler is a magazine for the wealthy or the want-a-bees.  The magazine is geared mostly to North America and Europe.  It tells where to eat, shop or be seen on the two continents.  For example, an article will inform the reader of a new five-star Sushi restaurant in Florence, Italy.  Thus, if you plan to travel to Florence for Sushi (not Michelangelo), this is the magazine for you.  It is a great coffee table magazine for the armchair traveler, for the pictures are gorgeous.	1
16673	REAL SIMPLE is exactly what the name implies. There is no clutter on the pages, which is fitting because this is the best magazine for people combatting clutter. It's excellent for those individuals that can't multi-task well and never throw anything away	1
20138	On any list of pure English-language business reportage, BARRON'S would figure in the top ten. This newspaper-style weekly compiles more numbers than just about any other publication.	1
22579	Looking for a nice well-rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design? Miss superb printing quality, clean European lines, meticulous attention to details? You've got it all in this magazine. After moving here in the US from a major European capital, I have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design. Architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in Ladue, but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed European apartment or loft in your typical suburban house. This magazine has been a delight to read (nice coffee table edition too). It has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now. Recommend highly	1
26671	I'v been taking this mag since it was called Boot. It still has the best overall info for builders, but they are starting to get a little trendy in their pages.	1
27223	One of my FAVORITE Magazines! I would'nt live w/ out it!  Thanx!    Artchalet @ msn.co	1
31345	SOME ARTICLES ARE OUT DATED.. WHY IRAQ APPEARS IN EVERY ISSUE... SO BORIN	1
31709	New York magazine is the flag bearer for "New York is the Center of the Universe" belief.  It meets this goal in dishing up news, gossip, reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis.  (How else can one get away with call shopping Strategy?)  The magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery (example: An article on the 2nd best cities in the world) it turns up the restaurants, stories and culture that make NYC such a fantabulous place.  It's worth diminishes rapidly, though, the further one gets from the Big Apple	1
33710	I enjoy the vibe of this Magazine.the Q&A'S are truly interesting to me to say the least overall.very Entertaining&Un-cut.it has a up-front vibe&take on things.not like other magazines that is for sure	1
36443	I was so happy to pick up Meridian. It's a great mix of fiction and poetry and I couldn't put it down until I finished it	1
36642	Aperture is indeed the preeminent art photography magazine, and consistently has enough good material to warrant a subscription independent of its clout.  Although ostensively devoted to art photography, many of the spreads are essentially photojournalism.	1
37620	I'll agree with everyone else and say that this magazine probably does need a new name. However, I love all the other features in the magazine! It is Cooking Light, but there is so much more - always an article on a travel destination, an article on beauty, and an article on a sport, as well as other constants. The theme of the magazine is total healthy living, incorporating health issues and exercise as well as healthy food, though I do think that it is mostly a food magazine. I gave it four stars because while the recipies do look good, some of the ingredients are a bit too sophisticated for everyday and too expensive.	1
40568	Few magazines can match the New Yorker's high caliber of journalism, fiction, reviews, and of course, cartoons; all written by some of the best writers in the land.  It makes mainstream magazines like Time and US News look like high school newspapers.  But, one word of caution: if you're the type of person that whines "liberal bias" at anything that you slightly disagree with, then this is not the magazine for you.	1
42934	Filter and Under the Radar are the only music magazines I come near. I hear Mojo is just as informative, renovative, and enjoyable, but I'm a little too close-minded to care about other genres I... don't care much about. Fans of rock/pop/what the kids are calling "indie"/alternative/punk/post-punk/folk/!!!!, take a gander at this.	1
43906	The Good	1
44784	I just wrote a review for OPM, and had forgotten about this magazine.  I also used to subscribe, and had recently let my subscription run out.  I will not say it is not because I do not like this magazine, but because I am trying to save some money.  But the fact is, that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market.	1
45275	I've been a P&W subscriber and reader (even when not a subscriber) for years. I've also tried various other writers' magazines, such as The Writer and Writer's Digest. The latter two were fine when I was just beginning to dip into the freelance market, just beginning to look at publishers for first manuscripts, but when I gained more experience, I soon realized those just didn't make the cut anymore. The articles were too often repetitive and geared towards such elementary basics that I was no longer gaining new insights. P&W was the next step up.	1
47413	I look forward to recieving my magazine every month. I  really love this magazine. It has articles, marriage, sex, women's lives, etc. I don't know why the others didn't enjoy it.	1
48076	Man this is it, great mag for cool business people. What you do not know, you will after reading all this great info. Read on !!	1
50020	Although the stories and interviews in The Strand are well worth reading, I think it is worth saying that there are not many stories per issue, and, at least in the case of John Mortimer's Rumpole stories, they are taken from forthcoming books. That being said, The Strand is worth the four stars I've given it, but I would describe it as a &quot;coffee-table&quot; magazine, if such a category exists, due to its glossy pages, large size format, and relatively low number of stories and interviews in content	1
52675	Smithsonian says it like it was, albeit short and sweet.  Without sprinkling complex grammar and cute expressions that are the hallmark of so many publications, Smithsonian provides the latest meaningful scholarship, especially if it departs from traditional concepts.  Their photos are always profoundly informative and fresh, without cut and paste from the time-honored sources.  Their article on Gavrilo Princip, the assassin of Archduke Francis Ferdinand, shook me to the core.  Thanks Smithsonian.	1
53481	stupid that for bad supply side business i havent gotten the magazine and wont get it for at least another month and yet i am asked to write a review for it. BOO AMAZON WHERES MY MAGAZINE	1
55558	I never subscribe to anything! This magazine is great. There are usually quite a few recipes with ingredients that are easy to find and a nice mix of healthy recipes and indulgent recipes.  I'm on a health kick right now and find  most cooking magazines aren't that useful to me. I might enjoy reading them but I don't actually use their recipes. I've made 4 of the recipes out of this last Everyday Food issue and they were very healthy (lots of veggies, chicken, brown rice, salmon etc.) tasted really good, and were also fast which is a bonus for me. I'd give this magazine 10 stars if I could :-	1
57171	A magazine filled with hot women, movie reviews, game reviews, and nonsense that is sure to make you laugh out loud because of its stupidity.	1
59420	one of the most erudite music magazines on the market!  several in depth articles in each issue.  extensive reviews that don't fudge - candid and critical, and lots of pings to bands you've heard before, when reviewing those it's likely you haven't.  the only criticism i can think of, is that it's become so big and thick with ads that it's gotten harder to get thru!  but many of the ads display great graphic design, even they are fun	1
60773	needed. It's just as informative as MacWorld but more fun too read. To me MacWorld is like reading a text book while Mac Addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor.	1
61540	W..	1
63560	Where else can you get a magazine that talks about whatever it wants? From the perspectives of guys obsessed with computers, technology, and electronics, you get to find out news on just about anything remotely relating to these topics. Political, scientific, hollywood, businesses, technology, I love it. I get to read about topics that are covered in mainstream news sources, and on the next page, what's new with Japanese schoolgirls. I get such a kick out of it.	1
64150	I like Shape because it has great tips to help spice up a workout so you never get bored.  There are great articles on places to stay, hike, relax, etc.  As well, there are great inspirational stories	1
64682	This is by far my favorite magazine.  The pictures are excellent, the articles are informative and hilarious, it gives information on movies years in advance and the reviews are reliable.  The best part about this magazine however is that every time I look through it I find something new	1
66029	I love to cook. I am not a professional by all means but I do enjoy the concept of preparing food. Other than tv, "Bon Appetit" is one of my main sources I refer to that inspires me to create my next meal. I have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now. I have to admit I don't necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that I read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas. Some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue (I love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years) and Thanksgiving. What I am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end. From my point of view, a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make. I am blessed to live in a big city where I can find most of the ingredients but if I lived in a smaller city or town, it probably would be difficult to find.  These recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed. All in all, I still enjoy reading "Bon Appetit" and being inspired by the magazine	1
66802	Even if this magazine is a mag-a-log, what would we do without it? September issue rocks with Eva Mendes on the cover and some juicy fall finds inside. The biggest news? Lucky has found a way to shop with your cell while stuck in traffic. It's about time technology got up with our lifestyle	1
67826	I love this magazine(not because of the big ole booty's), because of the way they present the ladies. I have never seen a cover of King showing some skinny, no meat eating, starving her self to death type chic! They show real women, with real shapes. It shows how women look in the real world! I love it, and yeah I must admit, I do love the big ole booty's!! Sorry Ladies, I am a man! LoL	1
69687	I can give this great music magazine no greater praise than to say that pretty much all of my favorite new bands in the last couple of years have been discovered through Under the Radar. On top of that, they also write great articles on some of my pre-existing favorite bands. Under the Radar generally has much better writing than some of the other indie music mags out there (Devil In the Woods, Rockpile, Big Takeover, etc.) and fits my musical tastes perfectly	1
70543	A woman that is passionate about beautiful things writes this review.  I am an avid do-it-yourselfer and love to do things around the house.   This magazine has been one of my favorites for years.  I look forward to each new issue and the decorating ideas that it will provide.	1
73390	I am a serious foodie that loves to cook and is always looking for new ways to shake up the meals that I prepare for my family.  The beauty of "Gourmet" is that they do not concentrate on the cuisine of one culture.  I also appreciate that they provide articles on both the best methods, and on quick methods and dishes.  I have read "Gourmet" off and on for at least 20 years.  The magazine has changed somewhat during that time.  The focus has shifted to more of a lifestyle magazine than a pure cooking magazine.	1
80914	This magazine would be a delightful reading experience for a wide audience. It appeals the *most* to busy young adults, who are looking for quick, healthy, easy-to-make delicious meals, which they just *might* want to spice up with an occasional adventurous new taste in wine recommendations. There is a wonderful column on "new flavors". In the June 2004 issue it is "lemongrass". In the July issue it is "miso". There are fine recommendations for new restaurants in exotic locales, such as, Bermuda or Sao Paolo, Brazil. Also included are foods for special holidays, such as in June for "Father's day". Naturally, grilling is the "haute cuisine" on this auspicious day. The recipes for "Salmon Nicoise Sandwiches" and "Tuscan Baby Back Ribs" are mouth-watering ...	1
83141	This is not my favorite fitness magazine.  This is the size of a Reader's Digest, but is packed with ads just like a Beauty Magazine.  I find this a bit disappointing considering the breadth of information they tend to cover.  They share reasonable and attainable goals, and suggestions for us normal people.  The magazine seems to cover a wide age group, with information that is good for both young and old.  They do offer recipes, workout suggestions, and much more.  The magazine takes little time to read, and seems to only serve as a springboard for more follow up on topics you enjoy.  I think this is a better magazine to browse through at the supermarket than to purchase	1
86327	If you love fashion, you need to get Vogue.  Vogue will familiarize you with designers, classic style and the fancy-schmancy side of fashion that most other magazines will not get as deep into.  However, most of what is in Vogue is way out of the average person's reach.  I, for one, could very likely not afford one thing that has ever been in a single copy of Vogue.  However, for whatever reason, the Vogue empire continues to publish this fashion tome and sell the subs for a VERY low price (usually $12 for 12 issues).  Now THAT I can afford.  It is an unbeatable deal.  Will you glean anything from it?  Yes.  You will see how the other side lives and you will see some really wonderful photography and fashion at its best.  Is it practical?  Not really but it is fun and well worth the very low price.	1
90330	My husband and I love getting our monthly subscription. We read it to each other in the bath tub and get all hot and bothered. We often talk about the stories inside and discuss our interest in the fantasies we've read about. Variations has definitely led us to try a lot of fun things together.	1
91256	I've been reading Glamour for the past three years and it has been a great magazine all around. Glamour covers topics on health, career, finances, sex, relationships, style, etc. Of all the magazines on the newsstands, this one is the most intelligent and savvy for women in their 20s and 30s. Yes there are too many ads like in most magazines, but that's how the media survives, they get their salary mostly from ads. I usually don't mind because I feel that its such a great magazine, that the ads are worth putting up with. I have felt that at times Cosmopolitan is a little too focused on sex and "please your man" articles.	1
92320	If I could only subscribe to one magazine, I'd pick Marie Claire in a heart beat.  It offers everything other women magazine have, including love life, diet, beauty, fashion and celebrity.  In addition, Marie Claire focuses on issues larger than the domestic US.  Being an educated young woman, I am interested in real life issues that other magazines tend to ignore.	1
94121	I unfortunately didn't renew my subscription to the Week years ago due to constant travel and never being around to read it.  I have missed it deeplyt in that time.  Having just gotten the first issue of my new subscription it lives up to all of my memories.  A mixture of news items on all kinds of issues, from all sorts of publications and many points of view is refreshing and informative.  I find out about important and interesting things about which most never hear.  I cannot say enough good things about the Week	1
96487	When the publishers of my all-time favorite women's fitness magazine (Muscle & Fitness Hers) decided to stop producing it, I had to find a suitable alternative.  While it's not as "meaty" as Muscle & Fitness Hers, it's a good, inspiring read.  It devotes too much space to fluffy stuff like clothing and makeup (and ug, even a few celebrities), but overall I would recommend it...at least until something better comes along	1
97164	Perhaps this is not the magazine for moms on a tight budget who don't want to even daydream about designer items. But it fills a niche that the big magazines such as Parents or Parenting does not. As a previous reviewer stated, this is similar to InStyle. You may not spend $200 on a pair of designer jenas in size 2T, but it's fun to look at ... and maybe get one in a similar style on sale. And quite frankly, some parents do have the money. Having expensive items does not make a child spoiled. Raising a child to believe s/he is entitled to it does. There are spoiled children across all income levels	1
99595	I picked up a copy of Health at my local grocery store, mostly out of curiosity. I found myself enjoying it enough so that I will be ordering a subscription. Here's why:	1
102617	Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things.	1
104085	If I had to pick just one women's magazine to subscribe to, "Good Housekeeping" would be the one. It has many of the same articles that all women's magazines have: articles on health, fitness, finance, relationships, diet, beauty, and fashion. But "Good Housekeeping" goes beyond the surface in these articles, for example, their fashion articles don't focus just on high-priced clothing, instead they show outfits that look like their expensive counterparts that readers can buy for just a fraction of the cost. There are also advice columnists on things like household hints, etiquette, and relationships. Each issue also has a short story. There's also the seemingly obligatory celebrity on the cover and interview inside each issue.	1
108969	I have not yet received my issue of Creating Keepsakes.  I have viewed previous issues at stores and have enjoyed all the creative ideas and layouts.	1
117442	I really look forward to receiving this every month.  I am blown away by all their crafty ideas for art projects, organization, and meals.  Really fun	1
121654	This is by far the best photo magazine I have seen in my 40 years of being a photographer.(and I subscribe to half a dozen).	1
126085	Car and Driver is the multi-purpose auto magazine.  It is a hybrid between magazines like Road and Track, which focus on the exotic and the extreme in the auto world, and magazines like Motor Trend, which focus on the more practical.	1
130737	This is a light and colorful newspaper. I remember when it first came out .The idea was it would be a national newspaper and cover the United States as a whole. It does in a way and gives local news in regards to all the 'sections' of the country. The reporting itself is clear and very readable.	1
142577	*Fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles	1
149304	I love this magazine mainly because I am a figure and fitness competitor. It has great tips.  If you are not competitor and just love to workout, this magazine is for you, too! You will get motivated by every article and meal plans! I do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels.  Oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements. I used to get Shape mag  but I did not like the models in that mag.  They looked way too small to be advertising fitness.  I highly recommend this mag for those individuals are INTERSTED IN COMPETITIONS!	1
163268	Today I received the first issue - April 2006 issue. I found	1
169543	I have been reading this magazine for years.  I love the tips and enjoy looking at what is "fashionable" at the time.  I recommend this magazine!	1
170581	Playboy still has it; it's not just a magazine for men any more.  This magazine has it all, articles, jokes, stories, and of course gorgeous woman!  Unlike most adult magazines this one has class; it doesn't show extreme acts nor excessive nudity.  It does what it needs to with as little as possible.  You get mostly articles, and interviews with few images but the images you do get are great.	1
182075	Woman's Day is a good resource for women. It covers a variety of topics, including health/beauty, diet/exercise, relationships, children. There are tips for getting organized, recipes, crafts and decorating tips also. There's a Tip A Day Calendar as well as a Day to Day meal planner. It relies heavily on reader's tips which are scattered through the magazine and in the various articles.  Each issue tells you how to join the Woman's Day Readers panel to submit tips and maybe win a prize. And even if you don't want to join the Reader's panel, there are plenty of other prizes given away by Woman's Day.	1
194946	Great magazine. Published out of the UK. Excellent features and great bits of trivia. My favorite sections are Cash for questions (readers send artists questions and win cash)-someone asked Lou Reed if he really performed Heroin for a conference of psychiatrists and won 25 pounds,  NOW (new artists),Instant Karma &quot;where pop and philosophy meet&quot;. Also great music reviews, more than 200 in each issue of a wide variety of music genres. But what they do really well are lists -top 100 albums ever, The 90 best albums of The 90's etc...my favorite being &quot;when rock stars go crazy - The 100 greatest acts of Rock'n'Roll Folly&quot;- No.1 being Michael Jackson statue sails down the Thames (river in london	1
198533	I've been reading Men's Journal since the first issue. I've always enjoyed its mix of content. MJ interviews a wide range of interesting individuals. Over the years I've incorporated some of the workout tips from MJ's fitness pages into my workout routine. I especially enjoy reading the product reviews. The travel recommendations are always well written, if not sometimes beyond the budget of most readers (myself included!). Overall, Men's Journal offers a great mix of well written content	1
205638	Great magazine for families with kids! My son loves all of the activities that can be done! Great price too	1
214680	I live in one of the "Red States" in the deep south.  Therefore, unfortunately, quality yoga instruction and teaching is very hard to find.  But, fortunately, Yoga Journal is delivered to my area, providing most of the yogic wisdom and learning that I have received through the years.  However I agree with other readers, I don't care for the ads for cars and cellulite cream ~ (who needs cellulite cream btw when you have a regular yoga practice?) I also do not care for the models they use is this publication, most of them look like adolescent girls who have just come from the Senior Prom! There are a few exceptions here when they do a feature on Shiva Rea, Ana Forrest or one of the Iyengar family members but for the most part, this gives a misconception that yoga is just for young, skinny women, what a shame.	1
224369	This magazine really fills the voids that design school leaves behind.  I have developed some serious guts in fighting for what I am worth due to this publication.  When you are a new designer, you get taken advantage of  frequently.  College did not prepare me to stand up for myself in this competitive market, and this magazine not only keeps you up-to-date with the latest in the design realm, but also serves as a gutsy, motivational read as well.  This is a must have subscription for budding designers. What a relief to read a killer design publication from the midwest	1
228947	Men's Health Magazine provides informationand tips on men's fitness, health, sex, career, relationships, nutrition,recipes, weight loss and muscle building.No matter how much you know about men's health, there's always room to know more about ways to a better lifestyle, the top men's health concerns,and the importance of getting medical care and regular screening tests.So you deserve to pay more attention to yourself! Take better care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. Or if you are a woman searching for ways to help the men in your life, tell them about the Men's Health. One way to start is to use the resources you'll find in the magazine here.This Magazine is dealing with all aspects of the daily lives.	1
231375	Lieven's article, &quot;In the Mirror of Europe: The Perils of American Nationalism&quot;;is succinct, cogent, and in my opinion frighteningly accurate. My experience as a professor convinces me that we are in the midst of a nationalistic arrogance, whipped by endlessly reptetiive mantras including 9/11, war on terrorism and god, which the majority of my students now accept as truth. I have one suggestion, I think Mr. Lieven is overly optimistic when he comments that the neoconservative empire-builders are not yet the majority in positions of power. I feel their reach inlcudes the legislative and executive branch, much of the leadership of coporate America, an increasing number of Jewish and Christian denominations, much of the media-particularly AM talk radio, higher education, the military, and with another four years of the current administration, federal courts at all levels. I will bring up this article in many of my discussion groups. I think the article was well-written and important, my congratulations to the author	1
239537	We are very happy with how quickly our fiest issue arrived.  We ordered on 1-25-06 and our first issue arrived 2-24-06 (almost a month earlier than anticipated!)	1
240874	This is the only political magazine I will read.  It is a great read if one is a conservative, but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it	1
245053	Sports Illustrated is a great magazine, the premier magazine for sports. The writing in it is spectacular as well as the clear and helpful visuals that go along with every article. To make this short, I highly recommend this a subscription for any sports fan -- it's a great gift for a husband, boyfriend, or just any sports fan	1
251986	A lot of reviewers share similar views, as seen in the recurrence of similar criticism of today's magazines.  What these complaints also have in common is that they can tend to be fairly uninformed in regard to certain issues.  First off, we all know that T+L is for "affluent travelers."  Read the publisher's description, and it will tell you just that.  So if you're not an affluent traveler, then don't waste your money on T+L and stick to Budget Travel.  T+L occassionally has "affordable" stories, especially in their affordable issue in March.  But don't expect the hotels to be to be under $200 a night.  You know why?  Because nowadays under $200 a night means you're a step above a youth hostal, especially in Europe where you pay an extra 20% on top of every dollar with today's exchange rate.  The point is that T+L never positioned itself as an affordable travel mag, so to criticize its shortcomings in that respect is an invalid complaint.	1
261662	If you are looking for the quality of an APA journal, this is not one.  But if you love the field of psychology as I do, it's a fun and relevant periodical. Kind of a Enquirer of Psychology.  I find it a fun read when I'm relaxing, but be careful of their interpretation of research.  You know how that can go.  It's also got a flavor of Maxim or Cosmo type topics.  Sex, relationships, dating, what do men/women like as well as diet/nutrition.  Overall recommended	1
274906	I order this magazine for my wife. She is a good cook but is enchanted with the magazin	1
277404	He's been in the rock business a long time, serving as chief editor/founder of BAR, Bible Review and Archaeology Odyssey; he is also president of Biblical Archaeology Society among many other ventures.  I've read his Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls which he mainly edited, although he wrote a few articles himself.  This is a magazine of substance, one I would love to have a subscription to.  The issue of July/August 2004 has an interesting article/interview that Mr. Shanks orchestrated between Elie Wiesel and Frank Moore Cross, the subject being how they understood, approached, studied the Bible, from their perspective, which their lifes' work ultimately revolves around.  One, F.M. Cross, comes from a Presbyterian, academic background, the other, Wiesel, a jewish one.  Frank Moore Cross contributed several articles to Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls.  He was the only protestant to work on the scrolls among the original team of 7 other people, six of whom were Catholic clerics; he is an expert in this field.  And I just love Wiesel's mind, I love how he writes and thinks.  That one article, I think is really illuminating, showing how rich in teaching the Bible is regardless of its many detractors, or fumbling misinterpreters.  It is, as I've been taught in sunday school, G-d breathed, it's G-d's words, it is a living text even if it contains mostly stories of people long since dead and gone.  Elie Wiesel says of it: " Wherever you open it, any page, you know that you are in the presence of something that exists nowhere else."  The moral of the article is neither approach, Wiesel's or Cross', toward scripture is wrong, it just simply reflects the richness, the variety of the text	1
288851	I'd been a long-time fan to VIBE since they been out. I 'member I first lay eyes on em by checking the covers on 'em but not reading by 'em. y'know. They such knockouts. Yeah they definitely keepin' it real no matter what. I believe they'll be around more and more since them magazines u read all the time like ESSENCE, EBONY and JET. I still have love for them also. But to say VIBE doesn't suck. I'd never been a subscriber since last year and I definitely enjoy it to this day. I actually read the XXL and Source magazine most often now. Same w/ Upscale, Campus Life, just to name others. I luv they magazine to death man, knahmsayin. Ya'll keep it rocked y'heard. Nobody's bringin' the hype on ya fellaz. Keep it UP!!	1
299535	I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years.  I find it an excellent periodical.  The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a &quot;Mystery Classic&quot; at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century.   I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your &quot;mystery craving&quot; before bedtime.  Another kudo:  the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors	1
308103	The high price is predominately due to the shipping costs as this magazine is produced in the United Kingdom.  A subscription over there runs about twenty bucks.  However, even with the added expense to get this delivered stateside, iCreate is a great looking magazine with excellent editorials.	1
312574	I have been scrapbooking for more than five years, and I my style is rather simple.  However, I recently found myself in a rut, and I began wishing I could do the fancier pages, so I began receiving Creating Keepsakes.	1
316967	I was in the Travel Industry for years, and found CN to be an excellent, albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations, and all other aspects of travel, whether upscale or backpack. Yes, it is not encyclopaedic, and yes it is chock full of adverts. However, the latter brings the cost of publication, no doubt, and the former allows CN to cover a wide array of topics in each issue. Their travel product ratings are next to none, and shortlists the selection process, allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions	1
322898	Here is a magazine that focuses on modern design and clean-line architecture without the trendy vibe that makes a competitor like "Wallpaper" an expensive, hit-or-miss read. What I like most about "Dwell" is its consistency in presenting interesting designs from around the world that look quite livable and fashionable at the same time. Even the advertisements are quite compatible to the flow of the magazine, so much so that they often look like they are part of the editorial. There is a very useful "Marketplace" section at the end that tells you where to get a lot of the art, furniture and accessories complementary to the designs presented. I have often used these helpful listings to find some interesting things for my own place.	1
325520	A beautiful magazine - This one's a classic!  Not to be missed by all anglophiles.	1
326646	I've had previous subscriptions to this magazine and I have to say that its most entertaining in many respects.  The fiction keeps you reading, guy's first times are always interesting, the interviews are informative...oh, and then there's the hot guys (all perfectly legal) showing all their worth.  A great mag for anyone that can appreciate the beauty that is the young man	1
328640	Five "Big Apple" Stars!! New York magazine is a mind trip to New York City that anyone can take by sitting down for a brisk read of about an hour anywhere in the world. But it'll take much longer to digest the detailed topical sections in the back portion of the magazine. And it covers everything: from a throughly researched, interesting, and eye-catching cover article, to departments that cover movies, the latest Broadway play reviews, the night clubs, and a restaurant  and club section 'that goes on and on'.	1
332235	Very interesting with nice pictures. Gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world	1
332740	I have subscribed for years to this - in my opinion, the hand's-down best, most balanced and useful periodical on dog care and behavior available.  Practical, solidly researched, non-preachy and impeccably edited, it provides even-handed coverage of almost everything that contributes to a dog's happiness, well-being and ability to be a good companion.  The annual dog-food ratings alone are worth the subscription price.  Every constituency should be as well-served by a publication as dog lovers are by this one	1
334038	Go into high gear man! Great Business mag! What you do not know you will know, if you buy this mag. Read on man !	1
334801	OK, so there aren't as many ads (which incidentally helps its portability), but I've been reading Computer Shopper for 6 years now, and I still find it a great read and a very valuable resource. I read every issue not only for its usefulness, but also for entertainment value - I guess you can call me a tech geek! It's a great tool for keeping up to date with the latest high tech gear - I particularly like the Alfred Poor's Computer Cures articles and how-to guides for us "do-it-yourselfers".  Its features and buying guides are relevant and very informative. Over the past few years, I have bought several computer systems for myself and family members, thanks to advice from the experts at Computer Shopper and their recommendations on where to buy. So, even though I do miss the "tech-mall" feel of the old magazine, I'm still a fan and would recommend it to anyone interested in buying technology	1
338103	I love This magazine! It tells you about every new game that comes out brand new	1
338791	Imagine making a Beehive Cake or a Honey-Citrus Iced Tea. When looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. You will be cutting out a lot of recipes! In fact, I'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. There are 16 pages of recipes in a "card" format.	1
344234	I had heard of "Books & Culture."  I had never read it.  And then a good friend from college called one afternoon and told me he was sending me a gift subscription.  I've never enjoyed a periodical this much.  It has given me hope.	1
345376	The Wine Spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you're rich or that you soon could be, all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine.	1
350296	MAC WORLD HAS BECOME TOO  COSTLY. MAC ADDICT IS ECONOMICAL AND PROVIDES ALL THE CURRENT INFO I REQUIRE.  GOOD REVIEWS AND PLEASANT FORMA	1
352710	About two years ago, I became a subscriber to Shape, mainly because I had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine.  I had always liked browsing through issues of Shape in the supermarket, and I thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals.  Overall, I have enjoyed Shape and found it to be useful, but there definitely are some negatives, and the magazine might not be for everyone.	1
357818	This is the best PC gaming magazine you'll find anywhere. It covers the lastest games and hardware. A bonus, the issue comes with a free demo disc every month. Although PC games are fading out of the picture, XBOX is a good way to keep them alive. This magazine covers everything you need to know. It's the best thing to do if you want the most out of your PC. A good choice to start with is this. Get this magazine, your won't regret it	1
363528	*Fashion tips for girls of all sizes and styles	1
367745	I love House Beautiful!  It gives so many wonderful ideas.  This is a collection of ecclectic styles, patterns, and methods that will suit anyone's taste.  And these ideas aren't hard to follow.  With the smallest effort, anyone can follow the look they have in the magazine	1
373466	I absolutely love this magazine!  It is a wonderful motivation for anyone who wants to be healthy and strong.  I will be 38 in a few weeks, and am considering competing in a fitness competition because of this magazine.  I read it from beginning to end, and my husband even reads it.  He always asks if I saw the article on this or that, which is an indication that the information presented is useful and engaging.  If you are serious about your health, want to get in shape or want to take your body to the next level, this is the magazine for you	1
377821	Indispensable guide to what is happening in movies,television,books,and popular culture. Comprehensive,witty,well-written and,of course,entertaining	1
378681	I've been a BW subscriber for 8 years now, and if the magazine stays as good as it currently is, I see at least 60 more years of subscription.	1
379459	This magazine is wonderful.  It is very informative to the hip-hop culture.  I am very happy with my decision	1
381697	Good Housekeeping has it all - wonderful recipes, health tips, diet tips, articles, parenting advice, product reviews - and delivers it with the warmth of a beloved next door neighbor. Buy a subscription in companion with Woman's Day for the best in women's reading.	1
383447	What a beautiful magazine (full color pictures on glossy paper), and what interesting stories behind each food.  The recipes are sometimes doable, although most of the time I just like to read about the exotic ingredients in each.	1
385650	This is a magazine.  This is a magazine?  Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you can get it for less than $20 an issue (like I do at my local Borders).  Excellent quality	1
397611	"The Writer" is the premier magazine for writers of all varieties. Kalmbach is known for publishing a great series of specialty periodicals, and this one is extremely well written and edited, as is appropriate for the subject matter.	1
403692	The author of the Declaration of Independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the U.S. Constitution, Thomas Jefferson once wrote: "I read no newspaper now but Ritchie's, and in that chiefly the advertisements, for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper." [Letter to Nathaniel Macon, January 12, 1819]	1
403753	I love InStyle.  I can easily spend an entire afternoon with each and every issue of InStyle.  It is packed with the latest fashion trends and classic, timeless fashion.  It shows what is hot, how to put outfits together, who wears what, and it doesn't try to dabble in other areas.  It sticks to fashion and I like that.  That is why I subscribe to it and probably always will.  The best out there.  MUCH better than Elle and likely even better than Vogue.  I love it	1
407829	Love this magazine! Just wish it came out more often. Great for more than those with farms or homesteads. Articles on gardening, building projects, animals. Buy It	1
408804	Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.	1
417376	There was a time when I read a lot of magazines.  I found there being too much fluff and not enough stuff.	1
421130	Detailed articles, and interesting columns.  Balanced, and not afraid to be critical where appropriate.	1
422346	Woman's Day has the feel of a community with its intensely personal warmth. From parenting advice, health, cooking, crafts and homemaking and more, it bonds its target audience together whether you're a single mom, happily married, or even single. I enjoyed this magazine as a teen with my mom and love it even more as an adult. Highly recommend	1
427506	Bought this as a girft for my mother, and she loves reading them. Must be really good	1
428753	I received my subscription in a timely manner and received backdated issues, also.  I am very happy with the magazine	1
431765	This magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little, short articles on sexual improvement books, health, and beaty products. If any other these interest you; I would highly recommend this mazagine.	1
434364	First, I've bought the magazine just about every months (for 6 months) but I liked it so much that I've decided to subscribe for it.	1
441486	Like my fellow choc-o-holic white brother, Floyd's Garage, I too get weird and sometimes disgusted looks from some lame pastyfaced, flatbacked white girl at the counter. What I do when I put my "Black Men" or "King" magazine down on the counter is make comments like... "I love black women," "Black Women are the best," or I might mention to those most obviously in the negative... "You wish you had some butt and hips like these girls, now ring me the f--k up!	1
447476	Men's Journal has gotta be one of the best deals in the whole wide world of magazines. For 10 bucks you get wonderful photography, health tips, product reviews of cool stuff you'll covet, smart writing and, of course, regular features by that greatest of American ink-spillers, Jim Harrison. Heck, if they just photo copied the Harrison pieces and sent them to me in a plain white envelope, ten bucks would still be a screaming deal. However, I still dig the fashion spreads, the book notes and the travel writing. There is a consistant sense of adventure, curiosity and life well lived in this magazine, which is why it should earn a spot on your coffee table. Did I mention it's only ten bucks	1
448441	I love Glamour!  This has to be my favorite magazine of all times!  Granted the ads drive me nuts but I love the Do and Don'ts and all the clothes.  I am a shopping mogul!   This magazine is great for showing new trends and I love layering and almost always they are showing new ways of layering clothes and teaching you how to wear your clothes in a different exciting way.  I also enjoy the articles and life lessons as there is always something that I am interested in.  I read Glamour almost from cover to back!  I rarely skip articles!  If you like fashion and just articles on every life issues this magazine is for you!	1
448788	Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine fits right in the middle between the lowest-common denominator approach of Money magazine and the head-in-the-clouds attitude at Worth magazine. Kiplinger's has a nicely balanced style and tone; it never preaches, and I almost always find a tip, suggestion, or tax-saving idea that pays for my year's subscription in every single issue. If that's the measure of the value of a personal finance magazine, then Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine deserves a five-star rating. Good stuff, and a good value	1
455303	Each issue of Family Circle is full of USEFUL information.  Ordering it through Amazon is so easy.  A few clicks on the computer and you are done	1
457312	This magazine is a great way to get a book club to focus on what to read next. Basically the magazine is a collection of all sorts of "Best" lists to suit every taste. The "Selections" page starts with a collection of "staff favorites"  highlighted with a one-(don't bother)-to-five(rarely given, a timeless classic) star rating system. There's a digest of 27 "best books 2005" lists in a recent issue, a page on the Whitbread awards, a selection of current and upcoming books, reader recommendations, new in paperback, a year in books (e.g., 1981)etc. Coupled with very little advertising, it's great!	1
458302	Budget Travel is a quite a neat colorful magazine and is loaded with exotic far-away landscapes that do what they are designed to and give one a lift into dreamland. I also like some, not all, of their articles which tend to be well prepared and nicely written.	1
464241	Great magazine. Covers the full range of .NET technologies. Every issue is packed with windows, web, and xml development articles plus industry news and a lot more. High recomended	1
470108	I just wanted to comment on some of the other reviews that are posted here.  Many try to sterotype the type of readers who like Real Simple, well I love this magazine- and didn't manage to fit into any of there categories.  My aunt sent me this magazine and then I began to read it monthly, I enjoy the tips and sections like "No time to clean?, quick solutions for every room"- yes they do have product suggestions, but much of the information that is provided can be done with things you already have.  Others have called this magazine- " a slave to fashion", as a woman in her 20's I would say this magazine is the one that contains minimal clothing information.  Overall I enjoy this magazine, as others have mentioned the recipes are great and I always find plenty of good tips.  The photography and layout are amazing, I always use the old editions for reference or crafts	1
482159	Interview is one of my favorite magazines. The interviews are always good. I think that the interviews are more candid since it's done by peers. I also think that the photo shoots in the Interview are some of the best around	1
486714	great monthly information on the latest design trends and figures. Sadly it only comes 2x's a year	1
489837	When I was little, my dad always said good things about this magazine.  My attitude was always &quot;I'm not gonna buy a magazine to bore myself some more&quot; - I mean, c'mon, it's a history magazine.  I was absolutely wrong.  I picked up this magazine one day and I was hooked.  I would say that American Heritage has found its way to make history interesting.  One way that it does this is to somehow weave issues of current interest (as subtle as they may be) into its articles.  On the second thought, I should have listened to my dad from the beginning - he's an anesthesiologist - he knows what put people to sleep and what does not.  This magazine keeps me awake - sometimes I would put my paper/project aside just so that I could finish my copy in one sitting.  It's unfortunate that this magazine only comes out every two months.  American Heritage makes history grrreattt! ... even for a non-history buff in his early 20's like myself	1
492580	I got American Girl when I was nine. and now im going on my thirteenth birthday and still love it. I think you can be intreseted in Teen People type magazines but still love American Girl. It has lots of crafts and my favorite part-the "lunch box" section where they have ideas for food to make and take in your lunch to school. It is a short magazine, but they make up for it by having the JUMBO summer issue. I think its definitaly worth the money.	1
496001	Intelligently written, beautifully illustrated and designed, this magazine is a must-read for beginning book collectors and veterans. It should be of interest also to non-collectors or accidental collectors who just happen to love books. Great features on authors and genres will interest many; succinct departments will help novice and experienced bibliophiles	1
497540	As a subscriber to Martha Stewarts magazines I have to admit this has become my favorite, simply because its concise and interesting to boot.  Love the Week End dinner section, as well as the Recipe Index at the front of the magazine which is helpful when I am looking for something quick to consider fixing, but do not have the time or desire to sit down and read the whole magazine.	1
500205	In the years I have taken this magazine, I have noted that often covered material becomes tomorrow's news from the latest hot-spot in the world.  So prescient, it is eery - if you have any interest in current events, news or foreign affairs, this journal is a must read.  The contributors are a Who's Who of politics, science and business in the world.  Often the author list will become the under-secretary of state list in the next administration.  For example, the last issue discussed Avian Flu virus.  As a physician, I can tell you that these were excellent informative articles that explained clearly what was happening and what the danger was.  And now this stuff is on TV every day and I can amaze my patients with how much I know about the issue that no one else does.  Reading this will definitely make you look smart.  Try this experiment and see if I'm right.  This article is written in October 2005, days after receiving the October issue with multiple articles about China written by Chinese authors.  Of course that means that these articles aren't really useful for facts so much as they are useful for seeing what China wants us to believe.  I predict that China will be much more in the news in the next 6 to 12 months.  So put this magazine to the test and see.	1
501175	I've actually met people who have said, "I'm too old to learn new things." And younger folk who have said, "That's too much like being in class." If you're one of these people, don't bother with Mental Floss magazine, or with going to school any more, or for that matter, with continuing to be alive in the first place. Living is learning, and this magazine helps edify and entertain you while you're doing all that living and learning. Most highly recommended.	1
502067	This magazine does hold my kids' interest, and I feel it was worth the money for one year.  The articles and photos are meaningful and have helped get my kids interested in a variety of world subjects.	1
504678	A great magazine that keeps getting better as time goes on. I have watched it from the start and have continued to be impressed by Editor Jason Sizemore's growing tome to the darker side of Sci-Fi. With solid Interviews and strong fiction by established pros like William F. Nolan, Ben Bova, Tom Piccirilli, Neil Gaiman and Brian Keene and talented newcomers like Bryn Sparks, Jenifer Pelland, and Eugie Foster you can't miss with this one	1
507584	This is not your tipical music mag with all the coorporate mainstream bull.  This mag turns you on to what is up and coming in the music world and is a great tool for finding new music.  I recomend it to everyone that enjoys good music	1
509640	Our Ranger Rick issues are used first as reading material, then discussion material, then project material (cut-outs, etc) then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much.  Tear out posters line my son's walls. There is no objectionable material in the magazine, just wholesome, fun reading.  No political agenda is discernable from it, which is refreshing. As soon as it comes in the mail, my 10 year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through.  The knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day, where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge.	1
511517	One of the funniest magazines around.  In a recent article, the Weekly Standard proposed massively expanding the IRS to help pay for the massive debt and budget deficit.  Which group did the "Weekly Standard" say should be targeted for this increased IRS presence (and massive increase in tax rate - for some 100%)? The Entertainment Industry.  The reality tv show contestants, the teen-pop singers and the like.  The article noted that normally massive taxation would hurt an industry, but with all the people that really want fame, that go all out to get their 15 minutes of fame, the industry would continue along (I'm curious if O'Rourke realizes that the tax would be applied to similar writers).  Another O'Rourke article provided the readers with an alternate Inaugural Address by Bush (subtitle: "What if George W. Bush weren't a compassionate conservative . . ."; quote: "The media say that I won the election on the strength of moral values.  If the other fellow had become president, would the media have said that he won the election on the strength of immoral values?").	1
513841	I have a one yr old who enjoys Babybug and a 2 yr old who enjoys Ladybug. These are just THE BEST children's publications. We save every Babybug for posterity because the art is fantastic. Can't recommend these enough to family and friends.	1
519984	This mag has its ups and downs but there is no other magazine with more class and originality. It's an icon all over the world. The editor has inspired books and movies for her perfectionism and professionalism. She and Vogue have gone a long way toward making women strong and independent. Without Vogue magazine fashion would not be a multi-billion dollar industry	1
524503	I grew up reading Fangoria, when I could sneak it past my parents, that is.  Fangoria Magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article.  Now you are not always going to agree with everything they say, but you can always expect them to be honest.  When a horror icon is not performing up to snuff, like Stephen King or John Carpenter, they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws.  Fangoria also has the Chainsaw Awards, where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie, actor, ect, and you can also submit a name for Horror Hall of Fame (my guy has yet to win it).  They also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people; like the Japanese and Italian horrors (wow, they can make some splatter flicks), and more independent films that wouldn't be showing at the mainstream theater.  And they have pictures.  All the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color (though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the '80s).  This is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan, I whole heartedly recomend it	1
528169	When WEIRD TALES was revived around 1988, I was sorely disappointed in the direction the editorial staff had taken.  It was too "progressive" and not enough like the old WT so many of us afficionados knew and loved.  Lin Carter had a great thing going for the four paperback issues he came out with under the Zebra imprint in the early 1980's.  Unfortunately, he was not allowed to continue.  His idea was to keep the FLAVOR of the old WEIRD TALES alive, and he did it very well.	1
534118	Video game magazines have been all the rage in our lives. Yet there are just so many of them that tell different stories for different video game systems. That has been the case with one of the biggest-selling ones of all time, Gamepro. They truly have made it one the most provocative and well in-depth magazines with detail about what games are popular according to their writers, and what upcoming games and systems are all in the works. The magazine is quite well, but I honestly do wish they could try to publish more in the way of codes and helpful hints for several games for Gamecube and Game Boy Advance, when most of it primarily focuses in on Playstation 2 & Xbox. Yet, Gamepro really handles itself as a very deep gamer's magazine. Anybody who wants to be enjoy the field of video games, this magazine is worth reading.	1
539490	Though the magazine does have the MLM and &quot;You To Can Get Rich&quot; articles, it has validity. You can do anything if you find the right thing, something your passionate about. I've found the articles may not always fit my exact situation, but I can extract what is meaningful or useful to fit my unique situation or business needs. Isn't that the main goal here? You have to find it, no one is going to hand it to you. Do the research and the work and ask for mentoring. Follow up on the leads and ideas they give you. I truly enjoy this magazine.  Carpe Diem	1
544263	This one of the best magazine ever for science and new things, from car to everything. Amazon is usually cheaper on magazines than anyone else and no hassell about calling all the time trying to sell you something. buy this mag. you will like it	1
547301	here are the great things about this magazine subscription	1
562700	There are many reasons to love this great magazine and a few reasons not to. One of the reasons not to is there many ads, but if you want to read what great writers write you have to make reading The New Yorker on your top 10 list	1
564231	As someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier, organic way of life, I decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter.  Many did not strike my fancy.  For example, I found Organic Style Magazine to be a little too fashion and product-oriented for my taste, while Mind, Body, and Spirit Fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn't cover natural and organic living at all.  Natural Health, however, falls somewhere in between, covering a nice array of topics including fitness/diet, natural remedies, beauty, and food/recipes.  As someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy, I appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer.	1
569453	This magazine is truly outstanding!  It is very informative and only rarely makes mistakes!  I love the indepth and informative articles that they provide.  I also love the way that they always have such clear and beautiful pictures and there is no shortage of them either!  I also love the fact that all of the articles are in line with mainstream science	1
571923	This is an excellent magazine. There are very few magazines that I choose to read cover to cover. This is one of the few.	1
578113	"Better Homes and Gardens" has been a staple in our home for years. This essential magazine seems to always be there for you. When I think about it I would say that it has enriched our home and ultimately our lives. Its very visual style of lending ideas for enhancing our domicile and our surroundings has always been simple yet effectual in enriching our lives	1
584312	This magazine is ill!  I learn about all the new albums coming out, read the review,and if they say they are good, i go out  and buy 'em.  The reviews are also accurate, giving the appropiate number of stars.   I also love the sections on the new artists on the verge.  The cover stories never seem to dis-please me, always givin' me plent of info.  The mini articles are cool, too, from stuff like Warren's Sapp's all-star football team, to all about how Mike Jones was discovered.  One last thing I love about the magazine - they are never thin issues, and you know what that means!!!	1
596466	This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of.	1
600619	I have been subscribing to Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine for many years.  I find it an excellent periodical.  The genres range from humor, cosies, hard-boiled detectives, to locked room puzzles, with an added dessert of a &quot;Mystery Classic&quot; at the end of every issue, some dating from the 19th century.   I especially enjoy the absence of gore. The stories are just the right length to satisfy your &quot;mystery craving&quot; before bedtime.  Another kudo:  the AHMM is notably hospitable to aspiring short story mystery authors	1
B00008DP07:great_and_interesting_magazine:r._lemus_"rlemus"	Every month this magazine presents very interesting articles that expand your knowledge around science	1
B00007AYH7:the_best_of_knitting_magazines!:jennifer_jackson	This magazine is the best there is.  There is page after page of beautiful designs and excellent instructions.  I have bought some books that don't have as many beautiful knitting projects in them as one issue of this magazine	1
B00005Y2B6:wonderful_magazine!:anya	I was really pleased when I recieved my first issue. I wasn't sure what to expect from this magazine, but it was wonderful. The design and layout are so much more interesting than other magazines, that alone makes it a joy to look at. The articles are so great, and really offer insight into living a more &quot;natural&quot; lifestyle in the home. I am really happy that someone has put together this resource, because it can be diffucult to find good information on natural products and alternative housing. I was very inspired by the stories about building straw bale homes and can't wait to see more. I wished the magazine was longer so they could show more photos and insights. This is really a great resource for the eco-minded.	1
B00070Q2VE:i_love_this_magazine:j._rose_"crazy_knitter"	What a great magazine - its like receiving a small book of knitting patterns every few months - most of which are totally wearable. I really feel this mag. rides the line between fashionable and practical. I have gotten 4 issues so far and have knit 1 or more items out of each issue. The directions could use a bit more description - sometimes the designers think you can read their minds, but nothing a trip to the geniuses at the yarn store won't fix. There are also interesting articles about things like merino sheep - something you wouldn't think was interesting, but then you start reading it and can't put it down.	1
B00007AZWJ:_n_g_traveler:g._sundelin_"world_traveler"	Very interesting with nice pictures. Gives a lot of information for travelling all over the world	1
B000310L82:tasty,_healthy_food_for_folks_who_have_a_life:kateg	I love this magazine, and am on my third year.  The recipes are interesting, healthy and easy to make after a day at work.  They don't use fake ingredients, which was my complaint with Cooking Light - I'd rather use real yougurt than fake sour cream for instance.  And the recipes don't take all day and 24/7 access to a gourmet supermarket like the ones in Gourmet.  The nutrition articles are interesting and walk a sensible middle line between the low fat and the low carb camps.  Real food for real life	1
B00005NIPR:the_gardeners_magazine:angelina_mallory	being a garden designer i read lots of gardening magazines but this has always been my favorite. it is loaded with design plans useful tips, etc. for the experienced gardener as well as the new to gardening gardener. along with  beautiful garden photos is also the story behind the garden, the gardener, and even how long it takes from start to fruition. i look forward to each issue.... i only wish it were monthly	1
B00005Q7DY:adventures_for_adults_and_family:mr._johnny_garcia_jr._"johnny_garcia"	I especially love this magazine because it gives details of different "non tourist" adventurous things to do.  EIther with the family or by yourself.  From Canoeing to Climbing a mountain.  I recommend it for anyone who likes the outdoors and likes to live on the edge, and with this magazine you will know what most adventure-ers dont	1
B00006L1B7:creative_girl:	I LOVE Vogue living from Australia. I don't know what it is about countries outside of the US but their design sense is more pure and absolutely more creative. This magazine rings all the right bells with me and I have never throw a copy away. If you crave style that is different from every other magazine that is sold on the mainland US I would say spring the extra couple bucks for this gem	1
B00005NION:great_magazine!:ralph_lynn_hagans	I look forward to every issue. The projects are top notch.  I have subscribed to several woodworking magazines.  Popular Woodworking is one of the best	1
B00005N7QD:golf_digest_magazine:doyle_a._disbrow	The Address label is wrong for proper delivery.  Has street address instead of Post Office Box	1
B00005N7TX:no_junk_in_this_magazine:"dory"	I recommend this magazine to really learn techniques to improve your running level.  There is not alot of filler in this small magazine.  I find that this is the magazine I don't circulate with friends because I like to keep the articles for future reference.  I learn something new each time	1
B00007AZRW:the_source_for_the_motor_trend_car_of_the_year:enrique_torres_"rico"	If you are into cars or know of someone who is than this magazine should make you or them happy. Lots of cool pratical information and pictures for when you are in the market or just want to see what is hot and why. Besides reviews and ratings for most consumer friendly autos there are nice features on those dream-mobiles that most of us only fantasize about. There are also nice articles on auto shows, a section called  Trends where gossip aand opinions blend to pique your interest.  There is  usually an interview with some automobile innovator or mainstay too. The breakdown of an autos profile is helpful if you are shopping for a new vechicle or you just like to compare what is out there. Even if you are not in the market it is an entertaining magazine for browsing. The featured concept cars , which often never get into production or limited production are worth checking out since most of us will never see one,  let alone own one. A pretty good magazine for the car lover in your family	1
B00005NIP2:it's_almost_like_being_there...:	For those of us who miss being in the center of the universe, reading the Observer is almost like being there. In its pink pages I can read stories about New York's political, arts, society, finance, sex and gossip scene.  I can smell the inside of a taxi from my house overlooking the lake in Vermont	1
B00005N7TN:advanced_work:charles_e_osborne	I subscribe to several woodworking magazines and have subscribed to Woodworkers Journal since 1990.  Each magazine has a character of it's own with a woodworking level reflected in the complexity of the projects it presents.  This magazine is a bit more complex than, say Wood magazine.  It should be understood that some style and esthetics are usually compromised when a project is simplified.  I have one of Woodworking Journal's projects in my living room.  It is perhaps the most beautiful piece I have ever made.  If you have become an advanced amature (sp?) this magazine will give you projects that you will take pride in making and showing to others	1
B00005N7S8:absolutly_great:	this magazine really gives you good info on piloting today	1
B00005N7UN:making_your_home_look_better:bryan_carey_"bryan_carey"	Workbench is a magazine aimed at do-it-yourself type people who like to work on their own home improvements and save money in the process. This publication presents dozens of woodworking ideas for home improvement and a few for hobby, with plenty of instructions and diagrams to make sure you get it right.	1
B000071F95:quality_graphics_magazine:john_metcalf	Though not bleeding edge, CA gives a good overview of what's happening in the field now.  Only complaint is that the Annuals sometimes seem to be in a rut with similar or same folks featured again and again	1
B0000AWD92:perfect_service_and_best_price!:l._okamoto	The magazine started being delivered earlier than promised, and it's a much better price than you'll get from SI directly	1
B00005NIN8:gift_was_a_hit:pebblepuppy	I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law.  He loves it.  Got it for him 2 years now.  Easy gift buying, and he enjoys a present I bought him all year.	1
B00007JXIB:celeb_magazine_for_slightly_younger_audience:stargymnast	Popstar would be a great choice for concerned parents wondering what subscription to get for their ten-year-old kid, because unlike many celebrity news magazines (even more teen-oriented ones), Popstar is most likely the safest one out there. It covers a great deal of celebrities that aren't huge yet, and tons of stuff about favorites like Lindsay Lohan, Hilary Duff, Raven, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the cast of Harry Potter, Good Charlotte, etc. There are thousands of pinups and huge posters in each issue that will satisfy any music/TV/movie fan.	1
B0000A0NL4:a_must-read_for_any_gambling_fan:jessica_lux-baumann_"lagizma"	Casino Player is the end-all magazine for the serious gambler (and the gambler who likes weekend fun with lots of comps!).  It is one of the pricier magazines, but the cost is well worth it, and it isn't over-run with advertising.	1
B00006K6WG:wonderful_patterns:hillcountrygirl_"hillcountrygirl"	Contrary to the previous review, the majority of the patterns in the Fall/Winter 2005 issue were normal sizes (5'6").  This particular issue contains 10 jackets (two of which were for petites), four skirts (one of them petite), three pants (one petite), and four shells (two petites).  There were no dresses and no blouses with sleeves.  The interesting fabric choices and the superb fashion photography were also excellent.  This particular issue also had an article on how to change a petite pattern to a regular pattern and vice versa.  The pattern pieces have unique sophisticated shapes, very interesting for the intermediate to advanced sewer.  One thing I did find lacking was there was no casual sportswear.  The magazine seems geared toward business suits and formal occasions.	1
B00006AMT6:science_news:sarah_s._ferguson	I had subscribed to Science News for many years and somehow let it expire when I moved. I missed it greatly and was so glad to start receiving it again. It seems to be the best way to stay current on many fields of science	1
B00006KCUN:_far_superior_to_the_american_version:e._stephens	less traditional, more imaginative.  worth the extra $$$	1
B0007XWHVK:love_the_magazine...hate_the_amazon_service:d._williams_"brownrain"	I purchased this magazine subscription on 03/05/07 why is it a month later and I still have not received it?	1
B00006K39C:good_tech_articles,_details_and_pictures:david_m._stokes_"david_stokes"	The most amazing thing about American Iron is their tech articles.  Pictures are used to illustrate various steps in a process and, unlike most of the other Harley rags', the photos are crisp and detail the step! They really seem geared to a Joe Average reader who is not milling out the bore of their bike on a regular basis	1
B00005N7VK:a_world_discovered_or_remembered:b._chandler_"xyzzy"	Unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me. However it took quite some time before I could read anything about the era. Now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream I wonder if I should have kept up with this magazine.	1
B00005R8B8:brilliant:eric_jesse	This is the best business and money magazine out there. They cover everything thought you needed to know and everything you didn't think of.	1
B00006FXOO:amazing_magazine_-_well_worth_the_money:jennifer	Although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old, my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine. She has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation. Not only are the stories lively and entertaining, they are educational as well (I am also learning various things about history and culture that I did not know before!). There is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry. Since receiving this magazine, I have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills. These reasons are why I believe it is well worth the money and I wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time.	1
B00006KJE8:amazing!:you_know_me	This magazine is amazing!!  It keeps getting better and better, unlike all the other sell-out magazines such as Muscle & Fitness. It's a shame it doesn't have more readers! If you like the mag then pass it around, people work hard to put it together! A great buy!	1
B00005R8BQ:good_for_keeping_on_top_of_a_lot_of_business_topics:shanaz_sukhdeo_"'why_buy'_guy"	I have been a subscriber for some time. It's a business publication that does not focus solely on Wall Street financials - they are there to a lesser degree but this is not the publication if that is what you are looking for. Think entrepreneur or general business topics and that's Business 2.0. It does not focus on one topic or industry but covers all to some degree - think `oddball' as well. Monthly sections include `What's Next', `What Works', `What's Cool'. The articles are cutting edge in some cases, well researched and well written with an informal slant. They cover tech, marketing, product development, product design, ideas, new products and services, M&A's and a wide range of general business topics. You will find out about new things before most of your coworkers, giving you interesting conversation fodder for the water cooler, happy-hour settings. To go even further in figuring out their demographics and target market/s, the ads include autos like Camry, Land Rover LR3, Mini Cooper and even the Porsche Boxster, Laptops, Business Productivity Software like Office 2003, Business Products like copiers and printers, Mobile calling plans, HP, Credit Cards and even Lufthansa airline. So if you are not in this demographic, maybe they're not targeting your demographic. Why Buy: You are an up and coming business major or business professional in your `building your career foundation' of your career. You are entrepreneurial minded.

B000K0YFPG:pretty_good_:yi_wang_"jenoats"	This magazine is pretty. I am not that interested in long articles, so the fact that this magazine has alot of pictures helped.	1
B00005QJE0:jasmine,_peacocks,_bluebells:e._a._lovitt_"starmoth"	This bimonthly magazine is a wish book for those of us who don't have two full-time gardeners on staff, or a few acres of woods to devote to bluebells, or the ruins of an ancient abbey to train roses against.  My Regency ancestors were breaking their backs on hardscrabble New England farms, rather than building follies or planting mazes, or having their grounds landscaped by Capability Brown.	1
B00006KPSW:okay...._i_guess.....:	New moon is an okay magazine, but some of the articals might bore you like about "Duck Tape fan." or something like that, it is sort of like a school magazine that teachers might want you to ONLY read in their class, but some of the stuff is good, I am a magazine freak and I have all the Discovery girls issues and it is nothing like new moon,  New moon has facts about not be mean but "Dead people." and that is just really boring. I suggest this magazine to a History fan or a science fan, because it is for you..  Discovery girls atleast has Celebrity interviews and makeup and things about crushes, and reader art and cool stuff, but this magazine has things like:	1

B00005NIOZ:the_best_artist's_magazine_out_there!:k._murray	This is the best Artist's magazine being published. I have had subscriptions to them all at one time or another. I have been a subscriber for at least ten years now.  It's the only magazine that I can actually use in a class on how to:  My students learn from the articles,and so do I!  K.J. Murra	1
11291	I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow	0
18223	it is beyond me that a record label would put this out. it's so embarassing how bad he rips bright eyes from song structure, subject  the production and even the cover art looks just like fevers and mirrors.	0
26632	Completely worthless! If you liked the film, go buy the DVD because this album has no redeeming qualities.  The sound quality is fair at best, even for a live album.  Almost every track is jammed with totally worthless `commentary' at the beginning or end of the song.  The `commentary' consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason.  It would have been nice if they had put these `commentaries' on different tracks because the way they have it on this CD you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear.  The worst part about the album is the lack of The Fugees, which means no `Killing Me Softly'.  Sadly, you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven't played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible, even for a live recording.  Some of them sounded almost as bad as Fallout Boy on SNL	0
31610	I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following.	0
38931	Wow, did someone slip the wrong CD into my jewelbox or what?	0
46408	Having watched most, if not all of John Waters films i was sorely dissapointed by this Album, obviously his name was put to something he hadn't quite looked deeply enough in to. Talk about misleading. As we all know John Waters has a certain reputation for sleaze, trash, camp, kitch and bad taste in all the best possible terms, this album had none of this. Shame on you John Waters for putting your name to a complete load of rubbis	0
56612	Is there anything more sanctimonious than filming your last concert and inviting a bunch of fellow overrated hacks (Clapton, Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell) to the occasion, as if it's some monumental event? Please! As if the Band were anything worthwhile in the first place. Sorry, but the whole concept of a bunch of Canadians (well, four of five anyway) writing this stuff about Americana always came across to me as pretentious -- and it doesn't get much worse than that stupid shot of Levon Helm wheezing through "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down."	0
67360	Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album.  Stevens blatantly rips off his own music.  I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece.  Do yourself a favor and start there	0
77258	Ok, booty rap was good in the 90's, when it was offensive and raunchy like, 2 live crew, Disco Rick and The Dogs, Poison clan etc.....But this is just wack weak lyrics, corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same....And is it just me are these guys as rappers, just horrible there voices all raspy, and annoying and one the guy's from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr.....( what is he on crack or something)So if you like radio friendly, pretty boy music then the Ying Yang twins are for you peace...	0
87472	I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory	0
101198	Bought this CD based upon the reviews and the fact that they were recommended with some other albums I like, and man, what a mistake. This CD borders on unlistenable, with no discernable melody/talent to be found. I'm hardly some ignorant pop-music lover...I consider "Blueberry Boat" to be one of my favorite records - but this is just horrible	0
109614	I have not heard of or listened to, this cd series, but from the sound of it, its all bad interpretations of popular music.  I just want to say that if you want your kids to listen to music and you want to steer clear of the bad stuff... play classical music.  Play stuff without lyrics.  Play a show on tv where the characters sing.  Do anything but, buy a cd where people that aren't the original artists sing songs that were never intended to be for kids in the first place.  Censoring a song or cutting lyrics tends to ruin that song.  There are just some songs that aren't good for kids even if you cut out all the bad words.  Think about this... do you really want your kids coming up to you later in their life after hearing the real version of a song and asking you why the song they heard as a kid is so different from the one they just heard on the radio and then having to explain to them that the song they heard as a kid was a clean version of the song?  Listen... I'm all for trying to keep your kids away from inappropriate stuff for as long as possible, but cds like this are not the way to go.  All they do is make kids think that all music is going to sound just like the music on the cds and when they finally hear the real stuff, they're gonna be asking questions.  Do them and yourself a favor and don't buy these cds	0
116282	I love to hear old standards and such.  But I like to hear people who put their own take on it.   I can't stand to hear cheesy big band arrangements with some Frank Sinatra wannabe.  Where are the male versions of Nora Jones?   Tone down the cheese!  We need more people like sophisticated Shirley Horn and Betty Carter(NOT hams like Buble, Dusk, or boring singers like Diana Krall.  But what can I expect from the music industry?  Rarely do the best song-stylists get lots of attention.  So, hmmm, nevermind.  I guess it's always been that way	0
124836	I was never much of a Chili Peppers fan over the years, but I thought I'd give them a chance and listen to this disc.And just as I always thought, it's crap. Very few bands have been able to pull off the repulsive people/repulsive music combo as thoroughly as these guys have. I feel like I need a bath after just looking at their picture. As far as the "music" is concerned, the singing is awful(deadpan monotone voice), the instrumentation is very limited, and the overall production is 2nd rate. The ONLY plus, if any, is that the band manages to show some progression on the newer material, which is still not very good. The fact that this band has been successful over the years just proves that a lot of people have REALLY bad taste.	0
135563	I was disappointed by Ms. Jackson.  Though it's not such a big loss b/c i didn't pay much for it.  None of the songs "jumped" out at me.  Thank god i didn't waste time putting this on my ipod why upset it	0
142071	I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.	0
148586	I used to like good charlotte, enough that i bought this CD, but i really don't like them at all anymore.  They try to look all punk, but they are pop.  They whine a lot.  I think it's time to get over the fact that their dad left and they were uncool.  they should at least stop doing songs about it.  They have some ok melodies and words, but for the most part all their songs sound the same.  Good Charlottes first two CD's were almost good, but this one is bad and really whiny	0
161803	AFI used to be a pretty good band. Then, they decided to go emo-girlie-boy. The lead singer has made adramatic change from smelly-goth-dude to perfect-manicured-emo-girl/guy. What happened to smeely-goth-dude? Some of us actually like the music, not the "emoness". Not only that, but "Miss Murder" was waaaaay overplayed, and now it is encrested into my brain. I mean, come on, it's not even that good of a song.	0
169954	Yes the game has been missing the constant songs about drugs, girls, cars and jewelery. I tell you Juelz really came with an original formula with this album. The stuff he mentions on this one has never been said before and Juelz is an innovator as well as the rest of the dipset. LOL!!!! These guys listen to other peoples albums and just reiterate the same stuff in a different song and beat. Save your money	0
175925	GNR were a very overrated band. I found Appetite For Destruction very dull. This atleast has the band's 3 GREAT songs in November Rain, Civil War, and Live And Let Die. Get this for 3 great songs but stay away from GNRS OTHER CRAPPY SONGS AND ALBUMS!! THEY ARE NOT METAL!	0
182693	Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting	0
189905	I woke up this morning to the grating sounds of "Good Little Girls" blaring over my clock radio's single, worn-out speaker.  A speaker that has helped introduce some great songs over the past year, such as "There Goes My Life" and "Live Like You Were Dying".  "Good Little Girls" is easily the worst country song I've ever heard - and I thought Neal McCoy was bad!  Blue Country is the C&W equivalent of Wham!  (a dated reference to be sure)	0
192114	This is a pep rally on CD; an unsingable, emotionally charged pep rally.  It really upsets me that this is the face of today's Christian music.  The melodies are not easily singable at all, and the songs use all the same musical cliches.  This is worship manipulation at it's best.  If you read the words to learn something concrete about God, you will find nothing of substance.  They talk about actions to give God and our response to God, but no meat-and-potatoes of WHY we should be doing this.  God IS great, but WHY?  This is VERY disturbing, and completely unacceptable for congregational worship.	0
198799	While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste	0
202562	Simon &amp; Garfunle wrote a lot of forgettible music(most notably for the film The Graduate, which would have been a better film without thier dated msuic).  This cd dates very badly as all thier music does, it's got a very limited appeal, only for diehard fans, but beware thsi music really sounds DATED, I mean it's really unlistenable	0
212768	Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best:	0
221654	I love south music like three 6, lil jon, master p, but this is a disgrace to every rapper alive and dead. Man JD is just signing anyone these dayz to make money cuz he can't get no one wit talent. every song on here sounds like it was hurried up. Fu*k so so de and fu*k dem franchize boyz they make me sick.	0
225467	I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.	0
229658	Hey, that just goes without being said. All of their live albums suck because they suck. Go Creed! I can't wait for Scott Stapp's solo album! Awesome, baby	0
237459	Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though	0
242441	Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..	0
245963	especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd. & that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album. & I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say	0
253776	Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables	0
256368	I absolutely love Charlotte Church's voice, but I couldn't stand even 1 song on this CD.  She's lowered herself to a "Brittany Spears-wanna-be."	0
263026	Hmm sounds good, jazzy and chic. This should only be played in lounges. The only tracked I liked was amour. The rest I wanted to close my ears. Too much noise	0
266629	I would have to say that there is nothing whatsoever WRONG with the band Jet, but when you don't have any particular characteristics to call your own, there's nothing to complain about. Of course, this means that there's nothing to compliment, either..except maybe that they do an excellent job sounding a hell of a lot like too many other bands. People compliment them on bringing the 'old' and adding the 'new...' but I hear nothing new in their music. It's just ordinary, clichd classic rock, except for some reason no one told them that the classic rock era was about 40 years ago. If I want to listen to classic rock, I want to hear it on the classic rock stations, not the modern rock stations. Those are for the new songs, only.	0
274842	I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.	0
281343	Ya, Abomination to God also set it right in his worthy review. I remember the days where this panzy was praised and all of you ate that "One Call Away" and "Right THURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR" garbage. Does 2 stars explain anything? This apparently is equal to that D4L s***, which is actually the lowest of the low. Anyways, didn't I tell you Chingy would die one year after -Jackpot- hit?	0
284946	It is hard to imagine what the American songbook ever did to Rod Stewart that he would decide to degrade it like this, not once, not twice, but three times.  Stewart's decision to approach these shop-worn standards ranks up there with Napoleon's decision to invade Russia during the winter, it is staggeringly ill conceived.	0
292437	Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house	0
303478	I'm mean, I know these guys don't have a shred of originality.. Afterall, that make some of the same crappy beats you can put together on piano's and they just got to mess up classic songs also.	0
309158	After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers	0
323059	Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.	0
326421	I liked the Santana - Steven Tyler song/video. Since I found out about the sneaky root kit this software installs and the idea of no free use of something I buy within reasonable means - I wont buy the CD.	0
331862	Trash, and irrated plus the good albums ya'll give them 0's.	0
333719	I was (and still am) a huge fan of "Mr. Show".  It was the only reason I kept my HBO subscription.  It's hard for me to believe that the same talent that created "Mr. Show" produced this weak offering.  Might be the least funny comedy CD I've ever heard.  Virtually all the material in the album has been done before, and much better, by other comedians.  Most of the bits just lay there and die.  Mr. Cross seems to realize this and tries to make up for it by saying f*ck a lot.  Sorry, it just doesn't work.	0
337546	..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.	0
344612	First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable	0
353077	many people have judged this album as a masterpiece i know. But to me this is just a collection of boring ambient sounds. This is unusual of me because i usually like ambient music. Another double ambient album - Seti - Pharos - is a real masterpiece.	0
361359	The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.	0
369098	look i really despise bush. he's an idiot. and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that. but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree. seriously the music is really not good. however if you do buy it make sure you watch the DVD eh? its got a great will farrel skit on it. 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here (ie no w by the ministry)	0
377015	I was very excited to hear that this new Muppets Holiday offering was coming!  The previous two Christmas albums ("A Christmas Together" w/ John Denver & "A Muppet Christmas Carol") have long been family favorites at hour house in December.  However, this time I am disappointed.	0
380677	I got this album because Obie Trice did some great stuff on the 8 Mile soundtrack, so I figured I'd check out what else he'd done.  This album just doesn't live up to that.	0
387188	[First of all: I only gave this one star because the rating doesn't let you go any lower] I only listened to this album because someone who was utterly disgusted with it threw it on the floor and stomped on it, leaving me to pick it up. I proceeded to suffer through it so I could give you fair warning. If you buy this, consider yourself warned	0
393283	This album is pure crap! Just a marketing move to capitalize on the sales from Straight Outta Cashville, until he can make a real new album, not this microwaved crapola. If you like Buck, get Straight Outta Cashville, an Beg For Mercy, than wait for his future release, with actual new tracks. I strongly advise you not to buy this. It is a total rip off. I wasted my time Downloading this	0
408988	Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS. LEAVE GNR ALONE....GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS GNR SUCKS.	0
412736	This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams..	0
422535	Greatest Hits collections of rap artists are usually a pretty bad idea. Most good rappers pack a visceral punch on first impact, but this wears thin with repeated listenings. This is especially true of gangsta rap. With what allegedly should represent the best work of B-T-H on one disk, this collection falls on its face trying to get around itself. Arranged back to back, the rapid-fire syncopated delivery that constitutes virtually every track on this collection wears thin. The raps blur together, and after two songs, the obscenity-laced machine-gun vocal play loses its novelty value, sounding more like a stylized novelty than any type of artistic vision. Once the raps lose their ability to hold your attention, all that remains are the rhythm tracks, which are serviceable at best. Their biggest hit, "Tha Crossroads", appears here in a version that is completely unrecognizable from its better-known form, further reducing the value of this collection. Worse, they include a warmed-over version of "F- Tha Police", an exercise in futility that only serves to dissipate the power of NWA's original.	0
431958	Even as a joke, this would be horrible; however, I think this band take it seriously - and it blows!  I picked up this CD because I heard A.R.E. were like a combination of suicide, front 242, and iron maiden: Interesting.  NO!!  A.R.E. are a bad imitation of front 242 and watered-down Liars at best.  The guitar riffs are awful and the lyrics are even worse.   Example: "Hey World" begins with how much it sucks to be 13.	0
434888	The "drummer" (more like "The Anti-Drummer") on this is Johnny Cresci.  He is maddeningly lacking in even basic garage band ability, and literally has no idea what a 6/8 blues meter is.  How he landed on the same stage with these legends may be the musical mystery of all time.  For me, Mr. "Clueless" Cresci makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the brilliant performances going on despite his anti-rhythmic upchucking.....kinda like driving an Aston Martin with a flat tire!  I have tried to get beyond Cresci's chops for over a year of listening now, and I simply can't do it.  If you're a musician, his playing will make you extremely agitated.  I'm gonna have to trade this in, and go on listening to Live Adventures like I have for the past 37 years.  This would have been much better with the drum tracks totally muted on the 6/8 numbers.	0
438974	A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth	0
443690	After reading her excellent Halloween book, I figured her Halloween CD would be worth owning. I always search for "different" Halloween CDs, but this was filled with the same old stuff.	0
449984	"What's Up", the catchy song with the acousitc guitar out of tune (which, I always thought, would have been the perfect song  for Heart), is the only thing good here.  The rest of this album is a mess.  Linda Perry has, of course, gone on to better things	0
460955	With 2 cds of endless repeated chords, they don't have much to say	0
466175	A friend who knows my taste in music recommended VNV Nation to me, so I got Matter + Form based on the reviews.  In one sense I like it.  The production is excellent and I find every track to be creative and unique.  But I HATE the vocals and so I can't bear to listen to the CD.  This dude has the worst voice in music history.	0
472427	I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie	0
484181	Wow, I can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off. 1.- Rock and roll part II ( Gary Glitter) and 2.-Get it on (T. Rex).	0
492822	I want this guy to succeed so badly, yet he just couldn't pull it off.	0
502029	This band is getting alot of critical acclaim right now, but I'm just not feeling it. The single "Wolf like me" is the only song that stands out to me on the whole album. It is a great song, but everything else is just blah. I think the band could use a different singer, the guy they got doesn't sing very well or very "soulful". The music is good, very original and the only reason I haven't sold the cd yet. I really think ppl need to hear this one for themselves before they buy. Don't be fooled by these 5 star reviews. Just listen to the cd before you buy it. That's my advice	0
507248	I got this CD because I loved their radio hits "Bring Me To Life" and "My Immortal." While those songs are beautiful, they are not representative of the rest of the album. Although I tried and tried to get into this CD, the hard rock teen goth style just isn't my cup of tea, and the lyrics are too depressing. If you are a fan of bands such as Linkin Park or Seether, you might enjoy this. However, if you only like "My Immortal" and "Bring Me To Life" because of Amy's powerful vocals, you'd be better off listening to Tori Amos or Sarah McLachlan.	0
516340	Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after	0
528737	This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls	0
535420	Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music.	0

548797	I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.	0
558948	I'm sure it was fun for Van to record a bunch of songs he likes, but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg.  Thanks for all the great music through The Healing Game.  All good times have to come to an end	0
567629	I own this set, as does my roomate, and we both hate it. It highlights bands like 'red lorry, yellow lorry' that no one likes or listens to, and  uses great classic bands like Bauhaus' worst song as the first track. It is  the hollow, tin-y, embarrassingly hokey side of goth, and i am ashamed to  even have it in my house	0
574893	There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. "Songs of Judy Garland" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what "look" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of "makeover". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to "Liza Minnelli" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't	0
579323	I gave this a good listen, but did not find it all that funny ... or memorable	0
583921	Let's get one thing straight - Radiohead may be the greatest thing to happen to music since the Beatles.  That said, this is not the album for that reason.  Do not let this album turn you off from Radiohead...beacause it is truly not what they are about.  There is one hint though in where Radiohead will go.  In the song "Creep", which is not a fantastic song, there is a brilliant "CHU-CHUNK" made by Johnny Greenwood.   SO PLEASE - IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET INTO RADIOHEAD...GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  For the "rockers" - get THE BENDS, for people trying to expand their musical mind - get OK COMPUTER, and if you like that you may become obsessed with KID A.  There are some unbelievable songs on AMNESIAC, but it is not their most cohesive album, and HAIL TO THE THEIF is very solid.  Thank you for your time	0
588771	Their basically what would happen if you took P.O.D's lyrics, and then added boring 1 chord riffs repeated throughout the whole song followed by the singer screaming the top of his head off about God and self-loathing in a noise-bleed inducing pre-pubescent girl voice, so you have a band so bad it makes God himself want to commit suicide. The song titles are also annoyingly bad, obviously made so they sound artistically genius (but instead monotonous).	0
600329	I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this year, I was disappointed. I gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan went electric in this concert.	0
607173	Crikey!!!! What is this chunder? Wait a minute....art students from "Down Under" get together and make fun little songs while watching reruns of "The Wiggles", decide they can market these tunes to an adoring fan base! Yeah, this stuff could be the soundtrack to "Forrest Gump" alright. "Run, Forrest, run! Run as fast as you can from this crap!!!" And these guys are touring, too? Are they touring with Barney & Friends?	0

B000002O4W:awful:bluecross_boss_"blue"	This is the cheesiest music ever. Phil Collins, Glenn Frey, Chaka Khan? Are you kidding me? These were the worst artists of the 80's. Where's U2, REM, the Pixies, X, the Pretenders, Tom Petty, Prince, Springsteen, the Replacements, Husker Du? Does anyone like Rock and Roll? Phil Collins writes songs for Disney and Pixar now! What did Glenn Frey know about 'Smugglers Blues'? Do you think he was writing from the experience or from the heart? These are the worst artists, songwriters and performers of the 80's.  Enjoy the nostalgia, but the art which is song is seriously missing on this CD.	0
B000MRA3NU:innovation_is_not_always_a_good_thing:jo_ann_larkin_"happygolarkin"	This album is a real let down and it pains me to say so, since I really do like the KOL. The first 2 cds were catchy and they rocked. I didn't care if they were singing about groupie sex or street brawling. It didn't matter because the songs were great.But on this cd they've opted for an experimental sound that doesn't measure up. Innovative is one thing but that shrill screech in Charmer-what the heck is up with that? How often do you want to listen to it? Once was enough for me. I wasn't expecting the Pixies here. And then there's the reverb employed on song after song-why? It just degenerates into white noise. There are a couple of good tracks on the dics- Black Thumbnail, for one. But then there are throwaway tunes like Camaro, which is about as clique as you can get. That said, art is subjective, and there are obviously plenty of folks who feel compelled to give this cd glowing reviews. But I find most of it unlistenable.I can think of many cds that merit a 5 star rating; this is definitely not one of them	0
B000KCHZK6:too_much_of_the_same:alex_chaney_"spilot77"	After Norah's first two CDs and the Little Willie's CD I was greatly looking forward to this release.  To say the least I am disappointed.  I was listening to it on my commute home and had to switch to something else to keep from falling asleep.  Where is the range of work?  All of the songs on this CD sound very much the same and nothing really stood out to me.  I'm giving it 2 stars just because of Norah's angelic voice, otherwise I'd have to give this one a 1 star rating	0
B00000DRBL:starless:mtb_"profanation"	I heard that song recently &quot;Three Strange Days&quot;...and I recalled how much I detested it when it came out.  Overt pandering to tyros in altered states.  Now I can't get it out of my head, and may require a lobotomy.  There was a lot of interesting stuff that came out in '91; but this wasn't part of that canon.  Nice try School of Fish.  Have fun playing the CYO circuit	0
B0002TL6QQ:aint_nobody_hatin,_this_cd_is_garbage:the_main_man_"the_mighty_big_bear"	Me especially I cannot hate on Cam cuz I got his first albums and thats when he was serious lyrically. Either the money went to his head or he just ran outta s*** to say. And judgin that his subject matter stays the same I guesss its true. Dude spits some retarded a** lyrics. I give this CD a two cuz of the beats. But this dude is a certified beatwaster. These producers need to give these beats to rappers who can actually spit bars. This n***a sumtimes don't even rhyme	0
B000000KH3:waste_of_time!:jon_oneall	Don`t waste your time and money on this compilation.  What a cheap shot to take the consumers money.  Read the very fine print, it does have a disclaimer but you really have to look for it.  Shame on the distributor!	0
B000CEV4X6:didnt_like_it!:crystal_ortega-hougaboom	I listened to this cd and unless you are into the whole barking dog sound of a band I didn't like this one, one bit, but than again it was also for my husband. I definitely would not recommend unless you have heard of the band and like that style of music	0
B000EHRAXY:cure_for_insomnia:rushed_limbog_"process_due_octember"	this is no SAW 85-92 as some people compare it to. Oh, no. This is a largely unfulfilling listen. The tracks all sound too similar. I realize Richard's concept was to just utilize anlaog gear, but the drum programming and harmonic "development" is lackluster. Only track worth burping over is the last one... XMD something. Has he been taking piano lessons since Druqks? For those that want some new electronic music that packs a punch, check out Nick Forte's new release "young man's disease" which is better than anything else i've heard this year.	0
B000E5L8AM:nice_try!:dennis_figueroa	The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.	0
B000000H5K:sepultura's_worst_album,_and_thats_including_derik_green.:comrade_ren_"altarboy_of_madness"	Before you all dismiss me as an obsessive, close-minded thrash fanatic; I thoroughly enjoyed "Chaos AD," which was a Sep' album with the perfect balance of experimentation and death metal.	0
B000KG4BBI:avril_fan:louisy	I bought this CD for the Avril Lavigne song Keep Holding On. I really like her song, and this is the only way I could find to buy get it. Was to buy the Eragon Sound track. I havent seen the movie. Besides that I wouldn't have bought it	0
B0009I46TY:worse_than_no_doubt_and_bush._:the_curmudgeon_"www.likeasquashedoctopus.blogspot.com"	I know, I know - I never thought it possible either, that Gwen Stefani could produce something more awful than anything her (ex?) band No Doubt and reduced to house-husband Gavin Rosdale's band Bush ever could combined. Take No Doubt's attempts at reggae, their use of guitars and trumpets (together? Never good), take.. well, every Bush song ever recorded and "Hollaback Girl" is STILL a hundred times worse. Let's talk about WHY.	0

B00004YU4B:quite_frankily,_the_myth_is_better_than_the_album...:deepcloud	i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan.  i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from "the left banke" to "beulah."  this album is not that good, people.  it's not even "okay."  there are way better takes on the "brian wilson" (read: phil spector) sound.  whether it's "the ladybug transistor" or "the apples in stereo."  heck, check out a great vancouver band called "ashley park" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable.  they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops "a la stone roses."  you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff.  to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production.  chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good.	0

B000005D9F:what_is_the_sound_of_one_oar_flopping?:citizenfitz	There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.	0
B00004WNTW:very_bad,_music_for_people_with_no_taste:the_kid_who_loves_waiting_for_a_girl_like_you	I HATE THE BEATLES. THEY ARE AMONGST MY MUSIC GUIDE TOP 20 WORST BANDS EVER. THEY ONLY MADE A FEW DECENT SONGS IN HEY JUDE, LET IT BE, AND BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST STINK! EVEN A MARK KNOPFLER CD WITHOUT DIRE STRAITS IS BETTER THAN THIS! LIKE I SAID, ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO THE BEATLES OR ZEPPELIN DON'T KNOW WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ABOUT, HUH!!! GOOD MUSIC IS REQUIRED DIRE STRAITS, GREEN DAY, FOREIGNER, GNR, METALLICA, AND NIRVANA. GET ANY ALBUM FROM THOSE BANDS INSTED.	0
B000IFRQMW:young_jeezy_is_not_a_source_for_inspiration:n._whitworth_"fan_of_real_hip-hop"	Young Jeezy even proclaims not to be a rapper; yet, he is a motivational speaker.  So, in this case, he is trying to speak to the youth of hip-hop culture that selling drugs and carrying guns is the cool thing to do.  He should just consider himself a rapper; that way, when he's using grade-school rhyme patterns to get his message across, we can just call him a bad rapper instead of a bad role model.	0
B00000HZF7:not_many_lullabyes_in_spanish:"reader999"	As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it	0
B000ENWKN8:retire_please:try_again_"dan"	I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux.  Everything after that is garbage.  This album is no exception.  Every song sounds the same and is very predictable.  The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses?  He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money.  He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented.  I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless.  1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again	0
B000AA4IM6:not_the_voice_she_once_had.....:david_a._marks_"norcalidave"	As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.	0
B0001F7UHK:no_lyrical_meaning:rhonda_dixon_"music_lover"	This album is all about sex and infidelity, is this all way Usher's life is about. This album contains to substance worth listening to. This album is a total waste of money. I like 8701 100 percent better	0
B000FVGMC4:music_ok_-_but_what_is_he_saying?_:-&lt;:little_miss_cutey	While I like some of these songs, I cannot understand a single word he sings.  I even heard him interviewed and I didn't understand a word.  When he sings, he spends all the time looking down, so you can't even lip read.  I don't think he has stage presence and I think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can't form words.  He doesn't sing clearly and I just can't get into his music completely.  I think I'll stick to R&B	0
B00028U6BI:music_to_sleep_by...:m._harris	When the Airplane kept it tight as in 'white rabbit' 'somebody to love' they were a force to be reckoned with, but when they got ideas above their station as in this live album there musical weakness really showed. Now i happen to think that Jack Cassidy just about saves the band with that bass, but even he can't stop the monotony of 'bear melt' and 'rock me baby' surely the worst version i've ever heard and this is all down to JOrma Kaukonen's nasal vocal and mediocre guitar soloing. The guy maybe a great acoustic picker but his lead work leaves a lot to be desired and this is from someone who had to endure his interminably uninspired lead work at a Hot Tuna gig. Anyone who saw the clip in Woodstock will know what i mean..No wonder Hendrix's set was so eagerly awaited!Occasionally the band get it together and Balin and Slick's vocals mesh together brilliant, but on the whole the set is an endurance test and the studio versions are far more immediate. Face it when it comes down to it very few West Coast bands could stretch out and reach the heights of say Cream or Ten years after. As i said Casady is per usual on form but the drumming is fairly pedestrian throughout lacking the kick that could push the jams into another gear. It's better than 'thirty seconds' but then again anything is. If you think that 'happy trails' and 'live dead' are musical highpoints than this will complete the set, but i just think its sleep inducing	0
B00000EYWO:you've_got_to_be_kidding_me.:c._romaella_"top_name_on_the_board"	Someone suggested I listen to this because I was, at the time, into what lame beret-wearing record-store dips would call "creatively aggresive" music.  Then it was death metal (which I prefer without cursing or filth, you understand.)  Since then I've found the ascension into gabber and then full-on unmitigated hardcore.	0
B00008OWZE:good_to_see_an_artist_change..:m._l._bohn_"rockharder_12"	It's always good to see an artist change and try new things. Back in 2003 when Jewel did, it was a big deal. Everyone accused her of selling out, which I think is unfair. This disc, while different, is just not what I would call Jewel at her best. I found "America" somewhat enjoyable and "Run 2 U" was also, but the rest of the CD did not sit well with me. I did give her a second chance and recently bought her 2006 CD, Goodbye, and I must say, it's Jewel slowly regaining her musicality. Also glad to here that she will be making a country CD next, it will fit her voice well.	0
B00000HYX2:wow!_i_must_have_missed_the_point!:	Most other reviewers listed here believe that this CD is good - I wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary Mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier Mannheim CD's have made it difficult to critique a Mannheim offering!  I am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life - and this particular CD sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music, just with different chords.  In fact, if I was not paying specific attention, I couldn't tell when one song ended and another started!  I enjoyed what I heard, but I was certainly expecting more from this CD - many of these Disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings - at the very least, some variety seems to have been called for.  Disney has always included great music with their movies, running the gamut of musical styles such as classical, jazz, blues, and even hip-hop - so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high.  I do, however, highly recommend Mannheim CD's in general - just not this one	0

B00000733R:nonsensical_tripe_from_lydon_and_atkins.:joseph_p._ulibas_"jesus_of_cool"	This is What you want (1983) was a terrible album from John Lydon and Martin Atkins.  After an rift between Keith Levene and John Lydon occured during the recording of the demo tracks, Atkins and Lydon ran Keith off and he quit the band.  Instead of keeping him on the finished tracks, Atkins and Lydon removed Levene and Pete Jones (the band's studio bassist) from the audio tracks and re-recorded them	0
B00004XSRQ:vote_it_off_the_island:"perryink2"	Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television	0

B000NJXCG2:disapointed.__where_are_the_other_cuts?:it's_me,_"really"	This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then.  To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks.  And Emmylou Harris is brilliant.  But Sarah McLachlan's "Blue" has been heard before as has Prince's "A Case of You."  Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham.  I sure would like to have heard what they would have done.  Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion.  As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics.	0
B00063UEE8:don't_waste_your_time_or_money!:joe_anderson	As a huge Counting Crows fan, I thought it was kinda cool when I came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that I listened to the cd. It is nearly impossible to get through. The best way I can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke. I rated it one star because there's no "0 star" option. If you have any intentions of buying this cd, find a website where you can preview it first, and thank me later	0
B00000ICLC:too_bad_there's_no_"zero_stars"_rating:	This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2" mark the sound of the "rock water" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this	0
B0006IQM5I:bad_diction,_engineering_gimmicks_besot_otherwise_noble_effort:david_h._spence	A tenor very quickly on the rise, this is Villazon's second recital disc, one devoted to arias by Gounod and Massenet, all in sets of three, three for Massenet, and two for Gounod.  While still showing great promise, some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so, in the French repertoire, in part because diction comes up so short here.	0
B00068C81K:boring:j._medrano	NOTHING NEW HERE.	0
B00001OH7Z:dance_away_the_heartache:sun_dog	David Bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial.  This is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial.  A disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was received by Bowie fans at the time.  It has some good moments, but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it.	0
B000FFP000:make_it_stop:	Just another cd of the awful, awful techno-crud that has infested goth/industrial clubs, while REAL artists like Cinema Strange and Knifeladder get the shaft. Worthless on every level	0
B00005177I:cat_lovers_beware:	The Cat Carol is the most depressing Christmas song I have ever heard. Not to ruin the ending for you but THE CAT DIES! Didn't exactly put me in the holiday spirit	0
B000002H9X:mostly_boring:preston	This album is so boring in most places.  I don't know where Keith Sweat's head was at.  It doesn't keep your attention on the second half.  Keep it Comin' was okay, but the other songs Keith produced as well as Joe Public were lousy. He was smart to include There You Go from New Jack City, but the songs before and after it are so bland, It seemed like the formula that worked for Keith Sweat's first two albums didn't work here. I fell to sleep while hearing the album's second half--how can anyone create such dull songs on here?  Sweat's trademark whining just does not blend with these songs.  If he had wanted to, he would have given these songs to Usher instead of singing them himself--they'd be better under him(Usher).  But I warn you, don't get this album--it's going to let you down	0
B00004S5FA:don't_quit_your_day_job,_norman!:dawn_woodruff_"hardew2"	Ok, I've listened to Fat Boy Slim.  That guy's stuff isn't bad, by no means main stream, but worth while.  But ... this Norman Cook - he's horrible.  It's no wonder Cook developed an alter ego.  With the exception of a few easily recognisable tunes, I couldn't believe this &quot;stuff&quot; had come from the same artist that produced Praise You.  Renegade Master is the type of track I've come to know and respect (that one is a keeper), and I have to give props for I Left My Wallet in El Segundo.  Other than that, this album sounds like someone mixed songs from the first dozen records they found during their expedition to the flea market.  If this is the sound you're looking for, save a few bucks, check out your local yard sales.  So as not to be too negative, I'll say this; the printing job on the CD itself is charming.  The notion of making it look like a turntable was inspired	0
B000G7PN9U:20_year_fan_and_hornsby_buff_still_found_surprises:j._m._smirh_"johnnys118"	I have followed Bruce Hornsby for over 20 years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert DVDs.  I was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other, but if you have been to  Hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh..no exception here.  I loved the DVD of some of his performances.  There are treasures here, Imagine, solo on the Piano at an awards show, the Star Spangled Banner at the World Series with Marsalis, and his performance with BB King.it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan	0
B0000DF00Z:bah_humbug:franko	The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again	0
B0000YTPES:disappointed:shell	The music for the soundtrack was so lame!  I though I was gonna cry cause I figured this was the end of B2K by this point.  The s'track wasn't even all B2K either.  I like the song with Jhene and Omarion "Happy".  Also I liked "Out of the Hood" other then that it was boring.	0
B000096FTB:buy_fear_of_a_black_planet_or_it_takes_a_nations_of_millions:	Knuff respect to Public Enemy, they are one of the few groups in Hip-Hop history who've provided fans with ill beats and consciouss lyrics.  With that said, this single blows.  It's trash.  The beats are trash, Chuck D and Flavor Flav don't rap, the DVD is just them hanging out in some clubs.  It's a shame, legends such as Public Enemy are far above this remedial single.  If you want to hear their best worx, go and buy Fear of a Black Planet, or It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  You won't be dissapointed..	0
B00005RKV3:ministry_slacks.:"m_x_s"	While there are some flashes of brilliance in this album, it is compromised by a lack of direction. The 'Tastes so Sweet' mix of Rapture is beautiful, although cut far too short. Faithless, Afrika Bambaataa &amp; Soulsonic, and Crystal Method are all good driving tracks at the tail end of this album. The high point, without contest, is Darude's ripping mix of Rising Star's 'Touch Me'. This is a cut to throw on for the peak... when you find the party is just outside of Barstow with Hunter. That said, then there are all the uninspired tracks in the center of the album. These are more appropriate in an adolescent Brit girl's drawer next to the Spice Girls. For some labels, this would be normal, for Ministry however, it is a dissapointment	0
B00009L1U7:not_the_best:katarina_"cs"	I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good	0
B000003YLJ:is_perspective_important?:jae_brown	Do you LOVE "On Eagles Wings"? If the answer is yes, then do you know the words to Panis Angelicus? The answer is probably "no." I don't blame you for liking this CD. The problem is that it isn't Catholic and it isn't Classic. You should ask yourself if you are willing to entertain the songs that Catholics have enjoyed for thousands of years. If you are willing to look beyond the guitars at your local mass, start with Sacred Songs by Bocelli, or Simply Baroque by Yo Yo Ma	0
B000001EOV:interesting,_but_save_a_few_standout_tracks,_not_enjoyable:denmark_jensen	Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: &quot;Whenever You're  Around&quot;, and &quot;Slide&quot; are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production	0
B000068R1S:misses_the_mark:charlton_bulkin	The versions of "Black Sabbath" and "War Pigs" actually comprise half of Black Sabbath's appearance on the April 26, 1970 edition of John Peel's 'Sunday Show.'  "Black Sabbath" features a unique third verse that appears on no other officially released version of the song.  "War Pigs" is actually "Walpurgis," an earlier incarnation of the song featuring entirely different lyrics.  Incidentally, the other two songs from that broadcast, "Fairies Wear Boots" and "Behind the Wall of Sleep," were released as bonus tracks on the supplemental disc issued with the first pressings of the original 1997 release.  All four of these tracks, while fascinating, don't rightfully belong on this collection, as this disc intends to highlight Ozzy Osbourne's career as a solo artist.  For that reason, the live version of "Paranoid" that appears on this set is equally unnecessary.	0
B000000LR3:know_the_label...:dixi_reviewer_"dzex"	I didn't listen the disk but know the recording label. Never heard anything good produced by the company in several occasions when I was hooked by the low price: very poor immitations. Just go for the real things	0
B000HT2KVQ:musical_vicodin._prescription_unnecessary!_:jason_"hastaj00"	Hate to say it, but this is pretty drab stuff.  That said, I'm hardly about to complain; how could I?  This was obviously written for a film (that I have no interest in seeing), and Mogwai just released 'Mr. Beast', a solid (if unspectacular) album earlier this year.  I kind of see 'Zidane' as a gift, then.  Looking at the whole thing from that perspective, it's impossible to be letdown.	0
B00004W5JE:poppers_folly:mike	This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them	0
B00004ZSB6:i_like_ac/dc_but_i_hate_this:	I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!	0
B000024TNE:r_u_all_kidding?_this_album_sucks_horribly...:ronald_t._barry_ii_"rtbarry"	yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that "tub thumping" is okay, even if it "gets old after awhile". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.	0

B000002BWG:guitar_legend's_debut.:michael_stack	In many ways a relic of its era, "Not of This Earth" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of "Time Machine", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.	0
B0000E1WMJ:more_eurotrash_moaning:michael_j._bethancourt	If you work in a comic book store, live in your mom's basement, own a lot of black candles, and think that H. P. Lovecraft wrote history books, then you might like this garbage. If you have a life, a clue, or a girlfriend, then you probably will not have any use for this stuff. I still can't figure out how record companies get away with classifying this pseudointellectual fluff as metal. It belongs in a category with Sisters of Mercy or Morrisey. This record is completely lacking any imagination or energy: depressing teenagers is like shooting fish in a barrel. I guess if you want to play dungeons and dragons and fester about feeling like an outcast, this would be the thing to listen to. Personally I think it's a huge ripoff when somebody takes five minutes worth of music and stretches it out into an hour. Don't give these jokers your money.	0
B00023P4QU:a_snoozer_...:wildviolet	I loved "Come Away With Me" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better!	0
B000NA1Z38:bad_influence:dwells_"dene'e"	This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that. Come on, as a young female, how am I supposed to bump this in my car? Every single song on the CD is disrespectful. You know what really makes me mad, this is what's supposed to be hot, popular. What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman.	0
B00005JH76:sugar_ray_and_the_downfall_of_what_was_once_a_good_band:joey_turman	Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality	0
B000002IZ5:have_a_coke_and_some_bile:automated_message_"estrusone"	Mindless jock rock masterminded by a dope fiend. This kind of crap couldn't even sell a can of Coke these days. Choreographed crunches of noise as lame as a crackhead on crutches. I hear Scott weiland kept a billy goat in his trailer during the making of this snoozer -- and that when recording was all done the goat was nowhere to be found, but Scotty was sporting a fresh new goatie	0
B0000CD5F1:sorry_pac,_i_know_your_turnin_in_your_grave_for_this:david_jones	Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money	0
B000KP62RK:awful_return_of_ultramagnetic:"draughnwill"	I wrote a review but I guess it was so bad for Ultramagnetic, Amazon booted it. The album is trash. Nothing at all like the 3 studio albums made over a decade ago. But don't take my word for it, sample for yourself.	0
B000089HC7:nooo,_sorry.__strangely_empty_of_emotion,_uninvolving.:tom_b_"handydandy"	I picked this up because a) it's Boz Scaggs, a guy whose records I wore out when they first hit, and b) it's full of great old songs.  BUT:  Boz sounds like he's doing something else, maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window, when he sings.  Hard to imagine that the man who punched out "Lido" can sound so half-asleep performing great material.  A washed-out, almost depressing performance.  There are many much better renditions of these classic songs.  I imagine it's hard to come up with new material, but please, if you're going to do these songs at least sing as if you're awake.  No emotion, no involvement.  And to add annoyance to injury, Boz somehow found the world's worst drummer for this session.  If you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him, incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive.  Pass on this one	0
B000009DGF:nice_try:	I was deeply disappointed by the so-called &quot;return of the funk&quot; with the Headhunters reuniting with their original lineup. As compared to Herbie Hancock's original &quot;Headhunters&quot; release, the Return of  the Headhunters is missing one main ingredient, the grease. This recent  release has traded the &quot;grits and gravy&quot; created by the sounds of  overdriven analog equipment and early model synthesizers, for over-produced  smooth jazz-funk, complete with overused N'Dea Davenport R&amp;B hooks that  left this album flat	0
B0000C52ET:some_people_shouldnt_get_record_contracts:music_fan_"vervarino"	this cd is pretty awful,you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd, one of the worst songs ever is Calling,, it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground, na na na na , na na na na, i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer........	0

B00000IA9H:for_the_already_faithful_only,_all_others_beware!:james_carragher	Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs	0
B0001WJMWE:dj_in_the_mix?_what_dj?:andrew_alves	the track selection is fine and okay, but the track order is bad. No FLOW! proving that he just took popular tracks that other big djs are spinning and sold an album without a smile. the mixing is terrible and abrupt, its basically not mixing. no art there.	0

B000000O71:ary_you_serious:joseph_p._zurcher_jr._"the_tacoma_salsa_shark"	I would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb.  Quite frankly I would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just Reburning these CD's and reselling them.  For 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite	0
B00000189Z:let_the_buyer_beware_on_this_one.:vinyl_spin_"john"	Like the other reviewer of this cd, I am also a fan of Buffalo Tom. Unfortunately this doesn't sound very similar to BT, in fact it is a bit dull.  None of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair, since I only played it 3 times, hoping it would grow on me.  I'd recommend "Up Here" instead of this one, it's much more listener friendly	0
B0000DZ3H9:unimpressive:thomas_dawes_"attorney-at-law"	I purchased "Empty" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock.  This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par.  Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as "Empty" B-sides, while the cover of "Electric Avenue" never really distracts most listeners from thinking "What is this and why?"  Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise	0
B0000VD03S:galactic_falls_flat:c._barber_"skot_barber"	This album in some ways is a perfect antithesis of the quirky, wacky, vivid personality of the first three Galactic studio albums--this is boring, flat and generic. Is that Stanton Moore or a drum machine? Precede straight to Garage a Trois	0

B000002B01:out_of_print??_why?_for_how_long???:scott_k._fish	The 1 star is for this 5 star CD box set being no longer available. Does anyone know why or if it will be reissued soon? I have the Highlights CD and the "Live at the Plugged Nickel" double LP - but not being able to buy this is disappointing and puzzling.	0
B000EPFD30:dont_believe_the_hype_from_other_reviews:tom_saleh	I am completly shocked at how high the scores for this album are on amazon.  Trust me, I am not someone who claims to be a music expert, but I am a big fan of Jam/Funk and Jazz fusion.  I play bass, I understand music, and Umphrey's is among my favorite bands (others include 311, Widespread Panic, Deep Banana Blackout, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soulive, Medeski Martin Wood).  In general I am open to all kinds of funky music, and Umphrey's usually puts out.  In my opinion, this band had the talent and unique sound to become the next generation of funk (following the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 311).  With this album I was expecting them to develop their sound from Anchor Drops into an album that could achieve mainstream success like RHCP's Blood Sex Sugar Magic did, while staying true to their unique roots in Jazz, blues, rock and even some metal.  Like I said, they fuse genres like no one else can...THIS album, however, was a complete failure in the areas I have described above.	0
B000H7JDVS:not_what_i_expected_nor_wanted:old_man_"guitar_guy"	Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.  If you want christan rock maybe this could be for you, but he missed the mark with me big time	0

B000066SE7:i_should_have_listened:aaron_g	I knew this wouldn't be the Sia from Zero 7's album. Little did I know exactly how bad she could be without the superior talents Zero 7 have behind the mixing boards. The song production is terrible. I couldn't find one song I really liked on this CD. Sia truly has a unique voice but it's evident that good production can make a star out of a flashlight. Still, I'm severely disappointed, particularly because I had to pay for this CD as an import	0
B00005NHKO:old_tiesto...mediocre_trance_hits....no_build_ups:m._ferrero	I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better	0
B0007PIDYI:ultra_disappoinment!__ranges_from_poor_to_mediocre,_nothing_great.__some_repeats.:c._artman	As owner of Every single Chill/Lounge music CD I am aware of, this was the biggest dissapointment in a long time.  Ultra Chill series 1-4 was outstanding.  While Ultra Chill 05 is not a complete disaster, I could not find one song worthy of a 5/5 star rating.  Quite a few 4 star songs and lots of 2-3 star songs.  Some of the better songs were repeated on older Chill discs or present on other series of lounge discs.  There is a lot of Jazz and Latin chill on these two discs, which I also like, but the Jazz/world/latin chill tracks here were repeats or nothing great.	0
B000002KC7:the_good_songs_are_hard_to_find:greg_brady_"columbusboy"	As others have noted, this was a time of turmoil for the group. Now trimmed back to a fourpiece (they had just lost guitarist/singer Bob Weston and singer Dave Walker), they also changed producers after 5 straight albums they had either self-produced or collaborated with Martin Birch on. This CD also leans really heavily on material from Bob Welch (this would be his last release with the band) and it suffers deeply for that.	0
B000002BVW:oxygene-starved:o._buxton_"olly_buxton"	Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.	0
B00000IAU3:time_to_sleep...(i_blame_eminem):paul_a._kirwan	I understand why so many people like Dido..She is beautiful, has a decent voice, comes across as a decent human being and is inoffensive...This album is the same - 'inoffensive'...some might say, bland...The tracks that work for me are 'Thank You' (used on Eminem's 'Stan'), but is done solo here and it works, 'Hunter' and 'Here With Me'...The rest just disappear into the background like a passing car...Nothing much happens, nothing inspires...I really want to like her, but it's all been done before..	0
B00067189O:dualdisc_format_has_a_dvd_region_protection?:predrag_suvajdzic_"pega"	I am very dissapointed with this DualDisc, because there is no comment (worning) about DVD region protection.

B000ION6F4:spoiled_by_a_rotten_apple:thomas_p._parham	I bought this CD for "Hole In The Earth", a very dynamic, driving and quasi-psychedelic rocker, and mostly got what I expected - more of the same along a continuum, sometimes pushing their envelope in either direction, as I expected.	0
B000000W7K:burwell_once_again_misses:	Carter Burwell's soundtrack music to &quot;Rob Roy&quot; was an early sign that he was not just getting it right. The score is all wrong but so is the movie. This movie needed an uplifting score. Carter Burwell could not deliver it	0

I love norwegian metal, and I love viking stuff so I thought this would be great. I was at least hoping it would be good. What I heard was a bunch of uninspired, mediocre, a dime a dozen metal songs. I mean there is enough good to save it from being a total waste, but not enough to give it even 3 stars. The high points are The fate of Norns, The persuit of Vikings, and Arson. These songs are bad @$$ and fun to listen too.	0
B000000WF0:don't_believe_the_hype:music_elitist	But for "The Drugs don't Work," which is marginal at best,this album is boring...cookie-cutter, nothing original	0
B000002P5K:you_call_this_music!:	From the twang of his guitar to the cowboy hat perched on his head, George Strait is totally and completely revolting. I mean, for goodness sake the man's like 100 years old! How much longer is it going to take for everyone  to realize that? If you like this kind of music, please go to Charter  before you're beyond help. Take this as a warning-don't buy the  cd	0
B000056QDB:deceptive_&amp;_misleading:frank_a._helton,_jr.	My wife got this CD for me because I like the music from the movie Cast Away.  She saw the words &quot;Cast Away&quot; in large and prominent print.  She saw the picture of Tom Hanks, very large.  She assumed it was the soundtrack for the movie and not just the 10th track of 10 on  the CD.  In hindsight she should have read the entire panel on the CD.  I guess the producers of this CD didn't think the rest of the music could stand on its own and so they deceptively packaged it this way figuring most people wouldn't waste time returning it.  If you had it listed in the rate column, I would give it a negative rating instead of just the one star	0
B000002JLJ:god_help_us:j._brandell_"manowarhater"	id advise not to buy the album.  listening to it is like contacting gonorrhea.  trust me ive done both	0
B000002LH2:never_buy_from_this_buyer!!:beebs	The CD came without a CD case and the CD did not play.  I am very disappointed	0
B000000DEV:are_we_talking_about_the_same_album?:atreyu_"atreyu"	I love plenty of Contemporary Country music... everything from "New Bluegrass" (Alison Krauss & Union Station) to "New Country" like Reba McEntire, Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Martina... even a lot of Faith & Shania.	0
B0007DBJEG:sad_to_see_him_go_-_even_sadder_to_hear_him_sing:number1muzicguy	OK - let me preface my comments by justifying the 2-star rating...It's Rodney Dangerfield - he was a class act.  As for the CD:  If you're looking for a few songs by a comedian accompanied by someone's cheesy clavinova, then this CD is for you.  I bought this because of the last track, "Rappin' Rodney", and boy was I disappointed. It sounds like it was recorded from an old worn out cassette.  Do yourself a favor - get all of Rodney's DVD's with his standup material and remember him for what he was - a comedy legend	0
B0000041RF:why?:giordano_bruno	There's always the argument that if Bach had had a modern piano, he would have composed for it. Let's consider another possibility: if some style-insensitive time machine had delivered a piano to Bach's doorstep, he might have tried it out and rejected it as a bad idea, since it so obviously fails to serve the paramount musical ideals that inspired the High Baroque composers.	0
B000001DT7:nice_voice,_poor_arrangements:enric_vidal_rod	Nana has a beautiful voice, but her singing is monotonous, predictable.  She lacks passion. Sometimes you feel she is reading the lyrics instead of  really interpreting the song. In addition to this, the arrangements are  unfortunately very poor. Her soprano range deserves a proper orchestra.  Only love could be the perfect background music for a romantic dinner with  candles, but this is not the album I would like to listen to again and  again	0
B000059LCP:half_and_half:c._ream_"xdelusion"	Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles "I have a bad feeling about this".	0
14316	Ok good CD. im not suprised. Ok jaheim may not have the b best voice but his music is good and it goes will with the voice that he has.  Yes yall this album does use profanity but the songs actually have meanings. I like that daddy thing song, and like a dj. This album looks at issues from a mans  point of view. Ya know we've heard the angry woman and how the man did t his and that now jaheim looks at it from a males view. Ok yall i know he is not the first one to do this but he did it well. Also this is a break from that [...] that is played on the radio.	1
20522	I didn't think it was possible for the Delays to top their debut release - but they have. While "Faded Seaside Glamour" is more immediately catchy and refined, "You See Colours" comes at you in a much more intense manner. The songs are more mature, the musicianship is top-notch and the recording sparkles with fat bottom-end and soaring harmonies. The high points for me are Valentine and Winters Memory Of Summer, but there's honestly not a bad track on this release. The Delays put it all together - great songwriting, strong musicianship and excellent production in a genre-bending mix that has something for everybody. It's a shame these guys don't get more recognition here in the States. Buy it	1
26444	There is a saying in the construction industry "Tripping over dollars to pick up nickels." Or in the regular world "Can't see the Black Forest for the trees."	1
33923	I had tears in my eyes when I first heard this album. I get emotional over music I really like, and this album got to me.So many great standards so well delivered by the duo. They deliberately chose slower ballads for this album so don't look for uptempo,snappy songs in this one.Not that Harry Warren could not write faster stuff like Jeepers Creepers,Shuffling Off to Buffalo etc. This album is to sing along with softly or hum.I kept thinking of Bogart in the rain in Casablanca and other lovers in W.WII.I know the main tune in that movie was not by Harry Warren;it simply reminded me of great love tunes from that era by Julie Styne[Time After Time] and the grossly underrated Harry Warren.Grab someone you love, some good wine and savor one of the great popular composers and a great duo.They should do more Harry Warren albums,Michael and George.I thank them profusely	1
47186	Without a doubt, the highlight is the DVD of the 1975 show in London.  "Born to Run," the album, had put him on the cover of "Time" and "Newsweek" the same week in October, 1975, one of the very few times that has happened for a non-news story.	1
56142	I would say that this is the closest that Cheap Trick ever got to making a perfect album. There are only two songs on here that I'm not one hundred percent crazy about...the slow and gloomy depressing title track and ' On the Radio ', which I think kisses up to radio D.J.'s too much. I love the rest of this.	1
68774	I was a music director at a college radio station when this came out, and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention.	1
78858	I've gotten a copy of this cd for every friend I have so they can know what I'm talking about when I crack a random joke.  My mom even loves it and she would not be considered the 'target market'.  For Mitch check out his first cd, if you can find it in stores, if not, go online	1
83552	Growing up with Classical Rock and having enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.	1
88243	this is the soundtrack that led me into the wonderful world of glam rock!  it is outstanding and i could just play it again and again....  it is certainly one of the most brilliant albums out there and probably my favourite soundtrack of all time.	1
95746	Call it American folk, call it alt.country, call it what you like, but if you heard this Aussie trio on CBS or NPR earlier this week, suffice to say their in a category all their own.  Love that harmonica.  Up All Night by the Waifs is appropriately titled.  I'll be up all night listening to it	1
102840	Attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now. I wasn't that big of a fan until I saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot. I'm running out of comedy albums, there's not that many good ones out there. So I bought it and I was impressed. The audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show "Insomniac". They would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night. He has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them. You never see the punchline coming a mile away. He is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity, stay away. He is one of the few that I enjoy now, tragically Mitch Hedberg died in March because he was another. The increasingly popular Dane Cook doesn't do it for me. Cook's Retaliation CD has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album. I think Cook is very marketable to the college, 20something crowd, guys like him because he's the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat, chicks think he's cute. I recommomend Attell myself, he is vulgar but is just a better comedian	1
109260	Okay Bryce nickelback yells not screams BIG difference and wtf sum 41 your kiding right sum 41 does not scream at all and you say "I like music" well you dont know any thing about music and another thing you poser is that Limp bizkit is NOT METAL they rap so how can you say that they scream ALL the time...limp bizkit is the WORST band out their they give a bad name to music itself and as for you dont write anymore reviews until you know more about music wich with the information i just got from you that will take a LONG tim	1
115651	As with her second album, I love "Thankful". Kelly Clarkson has a beautiful voice and has a lot of talent.	1
122037	1978 the stage is set for an album to emerge out of the crumbling decay that is the city of  Cleveland. Just like their other fellow Ohion's DEVO, the guys in PERE UBU obviously saw the world in a slightly different way.I have owned this recording in various formats since 1980 and I have never grown tired of this album. I find this album to have an almost timless quality in that even though it was recorded over 25 years ago,  if the original band itself tried to go back into the studio and re-record it, it  just would'nt happen. There is just a certain magic that they  captured in 1978, as to the music itself I tend to break - up this  album into 2 distinct parts. Side One being the more accessible "drunken" side with more garage style sounds almost punk rock in its leanings guitar wise, but a little too intelligent, just listen to the lyrics.Side 2 is definately the "drug" side like a bad acid trip vocalist David Thomas takes you on a journey thru the seedy back streets of Cleveland(I have never heard smashing bottles sound so creepy or atmospheric) and the rest of the band help to re-inforce this craziness by going off in a million different directions.I could give you a track by track anylisis of this record but suffice to say that music is somethig you should anylize, experience and consume at your own leisure, and then form your own opion of what each of the songs on this album  mean to you. So if you loved things like Throbbing Gristle's song Hamburger Lady then u will surely love Pere Ubu's album the Mordern Dance.As another reviewer mentioned before Black Francis of The Pixies fame must have almost certainly listened to these guys.I also hear there influences in recent  bands such as Portishead and Queens of the Stone Age just to name a few.So if you enjoy bold experimental music that is still as fresh sounding as it was in 1978 then give your ears a chance to have a listen to this album, even if you have to beg,steal or borrow it.	1
131788	Dave Alvin's sublime new CD is a cadre of songs written by Californians either born and/or who grew up in this land. The lyrics talk about what it means to live and love in the land of dreams and broken promises. It is also a look at the story of the frontier in this large western state. Dave Alvin has a voice that is deep and smooth and like a friend of his said "infiltrates your brain like a shot of Jack Daniels."	1
135821	Well, here we are.  One of the true works of the electronic genre in the 90's, "Lifeforms" is true sonic adventure.  This is obviously some of the best work that FSOL ever did.  "Lifeforms" is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together, interchanged and meshed.  For ambient work, it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace.  There is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs, despite their being ambient.  It is very original, I praise originality in music.  Give it a try, put on some "Flower" "Bird Wings" or some "Elaborate Burn.	1
147652	The more I listen to this album, the more I love it. What's sounds somewhat familiar even formulaic at first becomes totally captivating on further listening.  Like a girl you thought was nothing special at first glance but then becomes beautiful as you get to know the complete package. This is one cooooool CD.	1
157711	Like many of the highly talented and innovative groups of the 1980's, The Pet Shop Boys were ahead of their time.  This album was purchased mainly for "West End Girls" and "It's a Sin."  Play this album from beginning to end without interruption - it's fantastic.  "Loves Comes Quickly" emerges for me as the best of The Pet Shop Boys remarkable and unique sound - a composition reflecting orchestral complexity and pulsating energy.  The great contributions of Great Britain and Australia to music in the 1980's in my opinion comes largely from their composers and performers effectively combining the power and harmonic complexity of some classical music compositions of the mid 1920's to the early 1950's (no doubt the origins of some great movie scores) with the emerging sophistication and always present upbeat effect of rock and roll.  You will love The Pet Shop Boys	1
165989	If you were lucky enough to buy the soundtrack when first released in 1987 on Enigma Records, hang on to that out of print gem!  Straight To Hell is back on CD as Straight to Hell Returns, and may have a lot more tracks this time, but it also deleted two tracks from the original release and shortens another track.	1
177407	If this is to truly be GYBE's last piece of work, then they've concluded their brief and dynamic catalog on a fitting note.	1
184267	Right, so by putting a review down for this album, I am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight, cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long, well too bad that's not me, I am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music. Hawthorne Heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others, I have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over, they might even sound gay at some points, although, "we are so last year" made me laugh "I should have known you better, i should blame it on the weather" wtf is that??? Anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why I'm giving this 4 and not 5. But here we're talking music not lyrics. The music has nothing very special to it and I can play every song on guitar, they often use the same chords except for a few songs "This Is Who We Are", but they have a lot of interesting melodies and don't just rely on power chords to make their music interesting. Even though these chord sequences are often re-used, Hawthorne Heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses. The other thing I have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band (behind his guitar) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn't. This makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks. Hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness. Also check out "Where can I stab myslef in the ears" to see how hawthorne have improved. Overall this is a step forward from their last album, it won't change the emo scene forever, but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it	1
188662	Hounds is an outstanding piece of work. Two outstanding pieces of work if you look at it properly. The first consisting of five individual songs, though all with a very similar feel and texture. The second is a conceptual set of songs called The Ninth Wave, which has had many meanings read into it.	1
195325	Following the demise of Soundgarden in 1997, everyone was curious what Chris Cornell would do next. Would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood-curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different? He chose the latter. With Natasha Shneider on keys and Alain Johannes on guitars, Cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily Zeppelin and Sabbath-rooted musical background, and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record.	1
202725	I saw these guys live in the Twin Cities last week. They opened for Keane and The Zutons. These guys were definitely the best part of the show. They had great energy and actually looked like they were having fun. To top it off, they sounded great and their songs were well written. Give these guys a shot, unless you hate Rock 'n' Roll!!	1
208693	I just refreshed my ears listening to "Riot" again! Getting to to hear 1/2 Full, which clocking in at just over 4 minutes, is sheer electric blues magic. The price of this album is worth this one rocker alone.	1
216321	I like every song but 1 on this CD. They're the same ones that're on the movie and if you don't like the movie, you probably wouldn't like the CD	1
219818	Actually haven't heard this CD, yet, I can still comment on part of it. I was the lucky guy who did the live recording at the X-Ray Cafe.   Sold the masters to the band a couple years ago and just now got around to thinking, "I wonder if they ever did anything with those masters?"	1
231092	This is a good compilation of AFI's songs over the 10+ years they've been together. It's easily worthy of 10 stars. This CD allows newcomers to listen to the progress leading up to Sing The Sorrow, and to get more intimate with the band. I havn't purchased this album YET, because I already have all their albums, but plan on it.	1
246934	I was looking for a cd that I could listen to all of the time.  Oh my God, I am breathless.  I was brought to tears as they sang "Mama".  My mother passed away in 2002 and I never got a chance to say thank you and this song said it all.  All of Il Divo's songs have touched me in a way that no one else could.  Thank you for touching my heart.  I really recommend that you give this cd a chance.  All of these other people on the board that gave it a low score, obviously need a hearing aid and a heart.  Blessing	1
258318	This is a fantastic album. The fact that 5 star reviews are still being submitted over 10 years after its release (and they're not the beatles or u2 or anything) should speak volumes. I have played this CD countless times over the years and I am amazed that I am not sick of it. I am a pretty constant consumer of new music. Get this CD - you won't regret it! (PS I've never done an Amazon review before, but the fact that this has had only 22 motivated me). It is melodic, catchy, uplifting and cheeky - in short, a little piece of musical bliss.	1
264707	Being a professional dancer as well as a teacher and having seen hundreds of musicals, I must say I rate this as &quot;one of the best&quot;.  The dancers are fantastic!  the music utterly great, The choice of dances  (from classical to rock) is highly deversified.   CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET IT  SO I CAN PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. AS WELL AS &quot;ROCK THE HOUSE, SHAKE MY  BOOTIE, ETC&quot	1
269514	This was not a waste of Brad's time or mine.  Good job!	1
275508	A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music?	1
281924	All I have to say is great album	1
296231	The Edward Scissorhands score will always be one of my absolute favorite movie scores.  I truly believe this is Danny Elfman's best score and believe me, he's done some great scores!  The music is so moving.  The childrens chorus mixed with the soft bells and strings were absolutely perfect for this sweet, beautiful film.  Even people who haven't seen this film have probably heard the music from it since it is used in so many film previews and commercials.  A must-have for any Danny Elfman and/or Tim Burton fan	1
301993	(In reference to another review) - The symbol on the cover of Still is the Factory Records logo, Joy Division's record label.	1
306302	to set the record straight, rodney 'darkchild' jerkins produced ONE song on this album, and that is 'he said'.	1
320602	I like the main voice(s) and I like the music, but the voices are over powered by the music. If they turned up the voices a bit I think this would be a great album.	1
324681	Every listen I get more into this CD. Many catchy songs. I now need to buy more of Donald's solo stuff. Great music	1
332673	I bought a copy for a friend recently and she said "His music sounds so fresh and it's so singable.  The lyrics are meaty, too, not just fluffy pop. I'm kind of obsessing over this music right now--which is fun!  Thanks so much... I'd like to see him in concert sometime." I had this album for a year before I really got into it, since it takes a couple of listens to really appreciate.  At first listen I really liked We'll Do It All Again, and put it onto my MP3.  A year later I finally got the album out again and it bleu me away.  I realize that there is something slightly Barry Mannilowish about We'll Do It All Again, because he has some lungs, not because of style or anything.  He reminds me more of Jellyfish, or They Might Be Giants.  Some songs are so pathetic, vulnerable, and a little too honest for comfort as far as lyrics go, but they are energetic and hopeful in their delivery.  Anyone who appreciates art for arts sake will probably like this album.  The songwriting is superb and precisely produced. The second hidden track is a real gem, that you don't need to relate to in order to appreciate.  The lyrics are clever and fun even though several songs have a theme of loneliness.	1
338319	This is a wonderful effort by the Del Castillo brothers and their band. Mark and Rick are great guitarists and the band is one of the best that I have ever heard. I hate that anyone would compare them to the Gypsy Kings or Strunz and Farrah, because I believe they (Del Castillo) are far superior. Even though I am a huge fan of Santana, I think Brothers of the Castle and Vida are more entertaining and satisfying than Santana's last CD. If you are a fan of this genre, you should possess both Del Castillo CD's.....Brothers of the Castle and Vida. Their live show is among the best that I have ever seen	1
341020	It realy has been a long wait after Jellyfish. This Roger Joseph Manning solo effort is as beautiful as music can get, giving wagonloads of goosebumps all the way. If you have a craving for the ultimate in sophisticate popmusic you should get this rare jewel.	1
354502	Evan Dando has once again delivered an astounding collection of pop/punk songs.  This album rocks like Lovey and is almost as catchy as Come On Feel.  I've been listening to this album for weeks on end.	1
366067	I appreciate bands like Ima Robot, Film School and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into Alternative music, or at least I appreciate Film School for trying to merge the beauty of Electronica with Alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the New Wave you loved in the 80's. The thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band. Have you heard Depeche Mode's albums with a wind of Boards of Canada?	1
371878	Gene Watson's music was introduced to me by a friend who played drums for Sonny James, Ernest Tubb, and Dottie West.  I had never heard of him but then when I heard his voice on the CD I knew the songs.  It's amazing to me how a person with such a great voice has never received the attention that he should.  Every song is great but the one which I really like is &quot;The Old Man and His Horn&quot;.  This was a song I had never heard.  It also shows the versatility of Gene's song selections.  He has the best voice of any country singer I have ever heard	1
378552	"The Dreaming was one of those albums that I found in my parents CD collection when I was young and I haven't outgrown it yet. My parents seemed to hate it and never bought a Kate Bush CD after it (though I recently bought her whole collection except "The Whole Story" as it's just a greatest hits!). This album took me a very long time to get into however. I listened to it several times as a child and then put it away because I thought it was too strange. I took it out then several years later and loved it. I would now say it could be my all time favourite CD and is better than "Hounds Of Love" as I see it. The songs all stand on their own and Bush's voice is brilliant and her quirky themes shine through. This is the only album that I will never skip a track because I'm always in the mood for them all.	1
397679	The title gets it right - this is a very fun album. There are a lot of great songs on here. Infectious lyrics and music - it still surprises me that Matthew Sweet isn't more popular than he is.	1
408256	The one song I know is a remake is "Goodnight My Love."  I know this because I have it on the original 45 issue and the CD version is an inferior remake.  But the others with which I'm familiar - but don't have original vinyl to compare, only memories - seem authentic.	1
422482	...else if Michigan was on vinyl I would have worn it out by now.	1
427182	I, like many others, have been waiting for this album for quite some time.  Right from the first track, I was hooked.  "All My Days" is a haunting, melodic, heartbreaking opening to a fantastic album.  "Breathe" has a subdued yet powerful message.  "Home" is just plain fun.  "Song For You" is sweet, somber, and hopeful.	1
434089	Kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth. The Dreaming was underrated when it was first released, but I think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time. This is a superb album, tracks like Sat in Your Lap, Suspended in Gaffa, Leave It Open, Night of The Swallow, Houdini, and Get Out of My House proving this point. There's lots of anger on this album, as Kate put it herself many years ago, and it is her "darkest" effort to date, but it's pure brilliance! Buy it and be convinced.....	1
440131	I am a big Ambrosia fan and I love "Biggest Part of Me", "You're the Only Woman", "How Much I Feel" and the newer track "I Just Can't Let Go".  However, I wish this CD contained all of their Billboard Hot 100 hits.  The CD is missing their cover of "Magical Mystery Tour" (#39) and "How Can You Love Me" (#86).  For the casual listener, this CD is perfect.  For the chart hit completionists out there, it misses a couple songs.  I bought this CD used for $1.99, which was a HUGE bargain for the songs included.  For that price, I can certainly try to download the missing tracks	1
445858	If you do not yet own Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here AND The Wall, do not even consider purchasing A Momentary Lapse of Reason. AMLOR is junk by comparison.	1
456155	This is mood making, sexy, great music. Neal adds a slight rock edge to some beautiful and familiar melodies. This album is great for background music (we play it in our store), party music or just for listing. One of the best guitar players of all time 'sings' with his instrument. BUY IT NOW	1
465616	"Horizon" was a turning point in the recording career of the Carpenters--a more sophisticated sound more suited to Karen's rich and warm voice. But the album was rather short, and some of the songs just weren't up to the standards expected by their fans, which was reflected in the sales of the album, which was their slowest selling album up to that point.	1
467473	I have just about all of Robben's albums and I believe that this is his best work. The interpretations and musicianship are outstanding. Robben's improvisational playing actually comes across more like  composition. His  technique is extremely melodic. He is, in my opinion, one the best blues  guitar players around and his profound knowledge of jazz gives his music a  very refreshing &quot;twist&quot;. Check out his prowess on &quot;You cut  me to the bone&quot;, &quot;Prison of love&quot; or &quot;My love will  never die&quot;	1
476311	Hot Hot Heat is one of the few new bands to pique my interest. Their first release was decent, but "Elevator" is even better. Great tunes, drums and guitars - and, of course, Steve Bays' yelping vocals. There's only three songs I really don't care for - "Pickin' It Up", "Soldier In A Box" and "Shame On You". Looking forward to the next CD	1
492640	The earlier reviews pretty much said it all; this is pretty much one of THE best and most overlooked bands from the 90s.  Swervedriver is lumped into the shoegazer category often, however, if that label scares you off then dismiss its application to this band, because they aren't so much shoegazer - in that cough-syrup-dreamy-noise way - as they are sonic rock.  Yes, rock.  Who knew it could still be done, and believe me, they do it well, and uniquely.  If you've listened to Swervedriver before, then tehre isn't too much more to say - buy this album.  It's not as hi-fi as 99th Dream or Mezcal Head (in my opinion their best album and one of the best of 90s decade), but not as fast or dirty as Raise.  Now, if you have never listened to Swervedriver, this might not be the best album to start with - it all depends on your tastes.  Personally, I would suggest starting with 99th Dream or Mezcal Head; either way, this has all the qualities of every Swervedriver album - great lyrics, superb and unique songs, and that urge for more when it's over.  Sadly, this band was vastly ill-treated by labels and they are no longer together (however, some vestiges exist in the form of Toshack Highway).  But if you want to see what you missed in the 90s - even more so, if you want to see what the best of the best from that decade truly was - Swervedriver is a must	1
498316	This CD offers a great deal of incredible music by John Lennon during 1969 and the early 1970's when he fought our government in order for him and Yoko to live in the United States. The quality of the music is excellent and after you listen to this CD you want to run to watch the film!	1
511499	I INHALED this CD.  After all the hype and hyper blowin' up about this dance/punk/rock genius, I finally broke down and bought it.  Not that I was old enough to get into the discos in the mid 70's-early/mid 80's(I was still in elementary school, then middle school), but I remember(and still love) the groups that influenced this disc...The Buzzcocks, Heaven 17, PiL, Blondie...hell even the Rolling Stones "Some Girls" album.  And yes, I have to say(after finding "Death Disco-Songs Under the Dance Floor 1978-1984" CD and I'm ordering it)the old stuff is more fun.  But for the hipsters who don't know this is not original genre,it's pretty great.  No, it's very great.  The first song "Daft Punk is Playing at my House" was fun, and both discs made it worth driving through  snowy/sleety/frozen rain covered streets to work out at the gym these last couple weeks	1
523667	I purchased this album from Rasputina's website as soon as it was released there, and it stayed in my cd player (or technically, it stayed on repeat on my iPod) for a full fortnight after. It's full of the rock, groove, beauty, and madness that typefies the live Raspy experience.	1
535445	Wow what a great cd. I'm a big music fan of alot of different types of music and I have to say that this is one of the best cds that came out in 2004. You can't go wrong with this one. A	1
539577	This album was so good to hear when it came out. I like every song on here but my favorites are "Still Dre","The Watcher","Xxplosive","What's The Difference" and "Forget About Dre. Those are my favorites but there a lot of other songs that people will like. Recommend this album highly to rap fans. Buy this album you have nothing to loose because its Dre one of the best producers in the game right now so click on add to cart and be happy you hearing this classic	1
545377	Oh! Boy! how things have change..years ago i invested thousands of dollars in a killer Dvd-audio/Super-audio multichannel surround System.This was done to capture the glory of the state of the art music mastered in the wide frequency response of 24/192kHz.Example ..Donald Fagen "Morph The Cat" dvd-audio disc..this dics captures the dedicated genuine glory of dvd-audio multichannel done superbly.Today we have the so call Bonus Dvd Audio disc packaged together for one low rediculous price only to be disappointed  with the amature quality of the 5.1 mix.If you are an audiophile like me and know the difference between the dedicated Dvd-audio disc sold between $14.99-$29.99 and the so call Bonus Dvd Disc...you will understand why iam so irritated at this new phenomenon.Today most good recievers can play back stereo recorded music in "all channel Stereo/multichannel stereo surround which sounds superior to the so call DVD 5.1 disc.The stereo version of the Beatles LOVE album is worthy of my expensive system and is highly recommended	1
551990	Feinstein is in love with the Gershwins and that passion is never made clearer than in Pure Gershwin.  Michael's love affair with Ira's lyrics, his reckless abandon to the light-hearted spirit of the familiar -- and  lesser known --phrases, more than makes up for the less polished vocal  production in this early album.  In fact, it is that very element that  sells these songs as I've never heard them elsewhere.  Michael pulls out  all stops, embracing the less-than-lily-white additional verses of  &quot;Embraceable You&quot;, with the unbridled passion of a first time  lover.  His duet with Rosie Clooney arrouses my curiosity about the movie  in which this unknown number made its debut.  What a delightful approach  Michael demonstrates throughout....  Oh, to be that young and exuberant  about life, love and music again	1
561006	This was the second tribe album i bought i was gonna get this cd before i got the low end theory but they didn't have it at the best buy i went to. I like this cd a lot but i like midnight mauraders more because phife got some more rap time and i like phife a little more than tip. Most people like tip more but i like phifes style a lot. All like all the songs but the most is luck of lucein, afterhours, foot prints, i left my wallet in el segundo, bonita applebum, can i kick it, rhythm, go ahead in the rain, and description of a fool. Man i pratically like all the tracks but the most remeberable. I wish they were still going to make another cd but its just tip coming out with another solo cd. The only complaint is that phife was only in a couple songs. This is one of my favorite rap albums with the jazz and r and b mix with the lyrics which makes this a absoulte must have for any hip hop fan is part of the tribe classics.	1
567854	I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like.	1
576506	I have seen Phantom on stage twice and regularly listen to this cast recording.  It is a different approach to the classic Leroux novel; one that is gentler and more romantic, but still intense and passionate.  The lyrics and music are excellent.	1
587366	There is a reason why Styx was the first musical act to have 4 triple platinum albums in row!  Find out why. They are a unique band, with their own uncatagorizable style and sound.  Not hard rock, but can rock. Not pop, but catchy melodies and great three part harmony.  Not art rock, but themed concepts in their writing and dramatic tempo changes and crescendos in their music.  It is probably true that Lady was the first power ballad, though Styx was not credited for it.  Lady paved the way for other rock bands to showcase their softer sides.   Perhaps Styx was not always successful in their attempts, but they took chances artistically and musically and should be given props for doing so.  Every song on this CD is great; however the two that stand out for me are Too Much Time On My Hands and Suite Madame Blue.  Most people who have spent time in neighborhood bar will would likely agree that Too Much Time On My Hands is witty, funny, and true.   Suite Madame Blue a song which is a metaphor for the United States is simply One of the Greatest Rock Songs Ever!! The lyrics of Suite Madame Blue are as powerful as the music, and this song contains all the elements which made Styx great	1
601607	I saw Midlake at festival recently and had never heard of them. The live set was strong enough to convince me to order some albums and I'm now a solid fan. The opening track, Roscoe, reminds me a bit of Adrian Belew, a bit of XTC and a whole lot of Midlake themselves. It's like suddenly realizing how Coldplay should sound. The music is layered and atmospheric with a bit of an eels feel. Midlake is definitely their own band, for all the influences I'm throwing out. They make the sort of music that feels old, like your favorite album you lost long ago. Try 'Roscoe' or 'Young Bride' for an indication of their style. If you like either of those, you need to buy the album.	1
604380	Pinback BLOWS me away.  I consider my taste in music to be very diverse, with a tendency to love obscure indie rock-pop, from the last three decades (talk talk, split enz to elliot smith and death cab).  Pinback delivers some of the best, most consistent music I've heard in YEARS.  I started with Summer in Abaddon and was weak in the knees, then I acquired their debut album and could barely stand...and now, Blue Screen Life has about knocked the breath right out of me.  I haven't gotten through the entire back catalog because I can't stop listening to the three albums I have in my hands.  Words cannot express how fascinating this band is - intricate & complicated with a simple, straightforward delivery.  Their transitions are SICK.  They put their contemporaries (death cab, the shins, the killers) to SHAME.  I love all of the aforementioned bands, but Pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived, perfectly executed, diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back, over & over.  How many albums can you say that about?  They are heavenly.  The standouts are XIY, Boo, Concrete Seconds, Bbtone, Prog, Pene... oh, screw it - every song is GREAT!	1
b00006jj51:one_of_the_originals!:d._mckeown_"irish50"	NWA was an original rap group and with that being said, this is definitely a must have album for rap lovers. Along with Public Enemy, NWA christened their genre with hard core lyrics and tight bass beats. Although I don't agree with some of their lyrics, one would not expect this white kid to fully understand their view on life. Anyways, buy this album, I recommend it. Keep it away from the kiddies though	1
B00019PDAW:strawberry_jams_-_strawberry_shortcake:giuliana_kocovska	This CD is absolutely wonderful. I am in Australia so Strawberry Shortcake merchandise is not as readily available down here as it is in the USA, so you can imagine my daughters delight when this CD is being played.	1
B000050HVN:vibrato_on_a_soprano_saxophone:	Sidney Bechet was one of the first real fathers of jazz. Burns puts together a great combination of early recordings. Jazz historions note Bechet as one of the only horn players that could keep up with Louis Armstrong. You have to include Bechet in your Jazz collection, and this one is as good as any	1
B000HCPSSU:one_of_the_best_bands_out_there!!!:brian_rutherford	I would have to say that out of the countless bands i have heard over the past few years Into Eternity is one of the best and has one solid album here!! I think they have something a lot of bands do not have and the one cool thing about them is Tim Roth seems to give a real crud about his fans as he does guitar videos on his website to show you how you can break down his guitar riffs and that to me as a guitarist is so helpful (ive learned some of their songs this way) and this shows how he is not afraid to be the nicest guy and actually take that kind of time to be close and original to his fans.you just never see that these days. And the rest of this band has so much talent, Stu can scream like halford growl too and has a high vocal range and it makes them sound interesting. Plus jims drum work, how can anyone say this dude isnt one of the better drummers, he is so tight but can slow it down and tempo change very well. This album plain rocks,  It should be known as these guys were on Gigantour and rocked there too. Be cool if them and annihilator went on tour.  I have become very fond of them and hope they stick around and keep making great albums in a world overflowing with the same ole un-original bands that all sound the same!	1
B00007LTII:cosmic_charlie,_saint_steven_and_the_eleven_jam:anthony_perrone	There are plenty of reasons to get this Dead Album.  One is the fact that this is probably the best recorded Psychedelic CD of all time.  It was the first Rock album recorded on a 16 track.  In fact it was rerecorded to take advantage of the technology.  The remaster is splendid.   Another good reason is the great bonus tracks.  Almost 80 minutes of dead for less than the price of driving your SUV to the record store.  Can you dig it	1
B000002MN2:an_overlooked_gem!:marley	With all the recent praise heaped on Smile, Orange Crate Art still remains largely under-recognized and under-appreciated. Sure, Smile was supposed to be this grand Copelandesque landscape of America, from Plymouth Rock to The Grand Cooley Dam. But for my money Brian and Van Dyke Parks did it so much better with Orange Crate Art. Having written, what everyone unanimously agrees to be the most California of all anthems, Fun Fun Fun, I Get Around and California Girls, Brian turns his attention to a California not of Hot Rods and Surf, but of sun drenched valleys rich with citrus and vine. Here Wilson and Parks celebrate and pay homage to the likes of Jack London and John Steinbeck. And if all this were not enough, we're treated to My Hobo Heart, a latter day Van Dyke Parks / Michael Hazelwood masterpiece. There's also the lovely Palm Tree & Moon, a dreamy little ode to a moonlit beach, territory not unfamiliar to Brian. And Summer In Monteray is so unabashedly nostalgic it would even make Clint Eastwood Blush. If you haven't become familiar with this so very underated collection yet, you really can't call yourself a Brian Wilson / Van Dyke Parks fan until you give this one a fair shot. You might even find yourself humming Sail Away or Hold Back Time while in the shower. I know I did	1
B000GUJYZ6:fabulous!:jason_gunoskey	If you liked the original Clerks soundtrack, then you're sure to love this.  Thirteen years after we heard Randall and Dante rant and ramble on about hermaphrodites and name-calling during sex on the first Clerks soundtrack, now we are blessed with the opportunity to hear these two anti-heroes discuss other pointless issues like racial slurs and which movie trilogy is, in fact, the REAL trilogy.  And we, the Clerks fans, get to hear these meaningless dialogues in between every music track.	1
B000007492:the_best_single-disc_supertramp_compilation:musicfanatic	This is a good collection, 15 of Supertramp's best songs and the best single-disc collection of theirs you will find. The sound is great and there are no filler songs, here, they're all great to listen to. Highly recommended	1
B000003AD9:underrated_&_overlooked...why???:ice_cream_man_"neighborhood_dope_dealer"	this is a very well done record by 3 of Raps most elite personalities.  Cube, Dub, & Mack definitely knew what they were doin when they made this record.  The beats are amazing on all the tracks.  This is one you can listen to straight through and not feel any need to hit the skip button.  For me all these songs were hot from the first time i heard them.  If you're a fan of the whole West Coast gangsta rap thing, You GOTTA HAVE THIS!  My Fav tracks are "All the Critics in New York", "Do you like Criminals", "Gangsta's make the World go Round", "Westward Ho!", & "Hoo Bangin'"...although like i said, all the tracks are badass.  peac	1
B000001ZV9:worked_up_and_worked_out!!:r._davis_"upfromsumdirt"	Mr. Kimbrough done come thru with the dirt on this one.  This aint just blues music, it's soul music right in there with Isaac Hayes and nem. It's hard played and honest and that's the true pleasure of it	1
B0000041VV:wonderful_christmas_cd:jordan_t.	Too many people are overwhelmed with the more modern Christmas songs out there today and are unaware of the wonderful music available on CDs like this.  John Rutter proves his brilliance in arranging and conducting.  The music overwhelms the senses and the joy of Christmas overcomes you as you listen.  This is one of the most peaceful Christmas CDs I have ever heard.  "Wassail Song" is incredible, and if you are ever in a small vocal ensemble, this song is a must to perform.  You will not be disappointed when you purchase this CD	1
B0000065KF:another_beauty_from_the_quartet:donovan_rebbechi	Coltranes recordings with his classic quartet of '61-5 varied between very good and stunning. Coltrane fans may want to get the Impulse! box set instead though (which includes this CD and the other works of the quartet	1
B0000029FN:cab_calloway_can't_really_have_anything_less_than_5_stars:ned_k._wynn_"ekw"	Like Louis Jordan, his less well-known contemporary jump/jive artist, Cab Calloway fits into an area much beloved by Americans who recall the boggie woogie era or simply love the jumpin bumpin scufflin shufflin sound of that pre-rock and roll music. Though in truth I do love Jordan more and think he was a truely protean genius who was the grandfather of R&amp;B, Calloway was the consumate showwman whose jive/jump music can't help but bring a smile to your lips and a lift to your heart	1
B000000Y2Z:sublime:	Brubeck and Desmond work their special magic here and produce their finest live recording.  This is sophisticated improv to tame the beast.  I have listened to these tracks uncountable times and I never get tired of them.   This is truely a wistful soundtrack to transport one to a higher realm.   Try this the next time you are caught in heavy traffic on a rainy  afternoon.  You won't mind the delay.  It never fails	1
B00001QGOR:heavy_sounds:igor_coitus_"mypersonalizedsignature"	A great recording.  "The greatest bass solo ever recorded" (as put by another reviewer) is certainly a stretch, but the album is still magnificent.  Heavy Sounds is a title that accurately describes the music.  Buy and enjoy.	1
B000001E3Z:a_taste_of_rory_gallagher:j._e_fell_"boogaloojef"	The Best of Taste compiles material from their 4 official albums released from 1969-72. The albums consisted of two studio albums &quot;Taste&quot;, &quot;On The Boards, and the two live albums &quot;Live Taste&quot;, and &quot;Live At The Isle Of Wight&quot;.  This band was a power trio led by Rory Gallagher before he disbanded the group to embark on a successful solo career.  The band led by Gallagher on vocals, guitar (electric, acoustic, &amp; slide), harmonica, and alto sax specialized in hard hitting blues rock.  The music has much in common with Cream.  However, the Richard McCracken and John Wilson could not compete with the stellar musicianship of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  The undervalued Gallagher is an unsung guitar hero whose work compares favorably with that of Eric Clapton.  Like Cream the band favored extended versions of tunes like &quot;Sugar Mama&quot; and &quot;I Feel Good&quot; included here.  The music included here is varied.  It ranges from the slow gut wrenching version of &quot;Catfish&quot; to the more acoustic cover of &quot;Leavin' Blues&quot;.  The cuts from &quot;On The Boards&quot; become more jazzy at times.  Tracks like &quot;On The Boards&quot; and &quot;It's Happenened Before, It'll Happen Again&quot; highlight the band's more improvisational approach.  Hard hitting tracks like &quot;Eat My Words&quot; spotlight Gallagher's outstanding slide technique.  Two cuts I miss from this period which are not included here are &quot;Dual Carriageway Pain&quot; from &quot;Taste, and &quot;Morning Sun&quot; from &quot;On The Boards&quot;.  The live concert favorite &quot;Sinner Boy&quot; provides a bridge to Gallagher's solo career as the studio version was included on his first solo album &quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;.  This anthology provides a great overview of the early work of Irish blues-rock guitar hero Rory Gallagher and his battered Stratocaster.  It is even more essential as the four original albums are only available as imports	1
B00005NBWI:janovitz_is_his_name:vj	This record is one of the best that has found its way out since the new millenium. I am partial to good songwriting and Bill's particular folk-country-alt-emotive sound. The tracks to me all over the place and take it from someone who has been there and back -it was well worth the trip	1
B000000W6O:insane_thrashcore_!!!!:juan_martin_gabastou	On this album,Ice switches to a thrashcore style lovers of the style will go mad about.The songs are mega fast,with furious social lyrics and full of hatred.If you're into thashcoreand dig bands like Ratos De Porao,get this one at once.It suffers from some degree of dynamic compression   though,but if you can correct that,it'll blow your brains againt the nearest wall	1
B000001GXY:great_cds:john	The performances for every sonata and every partita are wonderful. This is the kind of material one can expect from Deutsche Grammophon. Wonderful music, a wonderful violinist, wonderful interpretations, and wonderful sound (not just for its time). There are also very few "squeaks" and he is almost always right on pitch! Often called definitive, this is the one to get. Highly recommended	1
B000006OU2:great_bluegrass_--_excellent_value:ronald_scheer_"rockysquirrel"	All-instrumental collections of bluegrass are hard to find, and if you like it when a band takes a break from singing and just plays their instruments, here's your chance for total immersion. All the songs on this compilation are from Rounder Records albums released 1976-1998, by artists with familiar names like Alison Krauss and Tony Rice, and others you may never have heard of.  All are first rate, foot stompin' renditions of bluegrass traditionals, with a few great originals -- Bill Monroe's &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; and Earl Scruggs' &quot;Foggy Mountain Chimes.&quot; Best known for most listeners is a rousing version of &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; by the Johnson Mountain Boys. If you like bluegrass with plenty of pickin' at breakneck speed, this CD will keep you smilin' through many, many replays	1
B00009RAJI:the_best_fleetwood_mac_album_ever_released!:t._b._vick_"learn_2_discern"	This is, I believe, the best Fleetwood Mac album ever record by the band. It begins with a nice quick paced tune, "Second Hand News" and proceeds to move into many textured songs from there.	1
B00000G2VV:he's_all_grown_up:r._g._villalobos_"luminarrative"	This is Beck's coming of age album.  "Loser" was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and "Mellow Gold" landed Beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation.  His earlier recordings, featured in an album entitled "One Foot In The Grave," were evidence enough of his musical genius.	1
B000001BE1:one_of_the_melvins_best..._(not_that_they_ever_made_a_bad_one):self_induced	this one came out in '91. its one of the very few albums that included the almighty Joe Preston on bass. one of the great things about this CD is that all the songs are all on one track. so it forces you to listen to this long, winding, sludgefest in its entirety. as most Melvins fans know, this (along with Houdini) was the pinacle of their musical career. after this, they made some great albums and some good ones, but never better than their self-titled album (previously titled "Lysol", but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit). it would be ultra-cool if Ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re-issue treatment. it definitely deserves it	1
B000F1HG6K:i'm_lovin'_it!!!:robert	If you're a fan of Latin music and especially Spanish guitar, you will LOVE Cafe Tropical. Every song is different from the next with instrumentation ranging from guitar, to piano, violin, trumpet, and a whole host of spicy percussion instruments. Every time I put this CD on I hear new things, which I find makes for an even more enjoyable listen.	1
B000BW36TY:she_won_for_a_reason!:mr._movie_"movie"	This is a really great CD. The Candian and American Idol winners are not usually that great, but Melissa is an exception. She just belts out her soul whenever she's at the microphone. My absolute favourite is definitely "Alive". It's just a beautiful song. Really, I recommend this CD who likes songs with great messages and a good beat. She's a great Pop/rock singer. You can't go wrong with this CD	1
B00042YC3U:perfect_singers:kim_chang_il_"beethoven_lover"	The first time ever I saw this group "Amici forever" as they were singing "Unchained melody", I have confused that song like classical music. Because, it was very familiar. Actually, I didn't know exactly what's that song that moment. Finally, I knew that song is popular music I used to sing. So, laughed myself.	1
B000001EQB:don't_let_me_down_easy...:james_a._king_"jim"	I went through a painful final separation from the love of my life when this CD was released in 1997, and I identified with every song.  I listened to this CD over and over for several months.  I saw Kim at the &quot;House of Blues&quot; in Hollywood during that time and sang along to every song.  This CD is my favorite &quot;bitter sweet&quot; CD of all time.  I love you, Kim	1
B00000HY6G:excellent_for_studying:"didaskalos"	I love this CD! I often put it in my personal CD player and take it to the coffee shop to help me as I study French. The music is relaxing but not sleep-inducing. Steven Halpern composes great music	1
B0000008ZU:this_is_the_outsiders_album_you_need:michael_g._fox	Not only do you get some great music with this cd, you get the beginnings of Climax as well. (The last 2 cuts are essentially Sonny Geraci solo songs done by 1/2 of the band that would play on Climax records)	1
B000AP2Z9O:split_personality:adam_capps_"electropop_fiend"	The first cd from Baby Anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare. I wouldn't claim that's a bad thing, but don't expect to be surprised if you're familiar with the genre. Overall it's a solid offering from Baby Anne and delivers the bass.	1
B000059T4T:one_of_the_best_ever!:dorothyanne_"movie_classic"	Do I mean the best album or the best singer?  You are correct if you said both!  I saw Kristin Chenoweth on a PBS show "Broadway's Best at the Pops," (though it was not the first time I had heard her) and decided to check out the offerings here.  This is a collection of the kind of music and performances I love.  She has a great range, a precise pitch, and a great style that is at the same time true to the music and to herself. In an era when singers try to outdo each other re-interpreting the composer's original work, not usually with great success, she is a blessing	1
B00000IFOS:great,_great_handel!:michael_j._colbruno	This is one of the truly great Handel opera recordings of the last twenty years. As usual, Nicholas McGegan proves himself to be one of the two or three greatest Handelian conductors of our time. The singing from beginning to end is first class. This opera is known for the famous largo "Ombra mai fu," but the music in this entire performance is a sheer delight	1
B000LE0THO:slightly_flawed--but_fans_wear_it_like_a_badge...:derek_arnold_"music_lover"	As a kid, Out Of The Blue was one of the first albums (actually, 8-track) I paid for.  That decision was made after hearing "Sweet Talking Woman" as a single, and after I bought it, the album grew and grew with me.  Every few weeks, a different set of songs stuck with me as memorable.  The first few weeks, it was "Sweet Talking Woman," "Turn To Stone," and "Mr. Blue Sky" (all pop perfection); the next few weeks, it was "Wild West Hero," "Across The Border," and "Jungle."  After three months, there wasn't a corner or edge of the album I didn't know and like.	1
B00008WT4L:spirit_the_best_of_spirit:salvatore_piscopo_"singer"	I agree with most of the reviewers that this band was very underated.great singing electric and acoustic guitar playing and great songs.why were songs like Natures Way and I Got A Line not huge hits?I Got A Line made the top 40 I think.Natures Way was a great acoustic ballad.also Nothing To Hide has a nice acoustic/electric section.also Mister Skin could of been a hit catchy.this band was better than a lot of the crap that came out in the late 1960's all the bad hippie bands of that era.as for the whole album I think it would get  five stars if it had some live tracks as bonus cuts,like a live I Got A line or Natures Way live hearing that live would of been fun. I heard samples on a live Spirit cd.a great unknown band that everyone should give a listen to and to remember what real musicians and songs were about in the old days	1
B00081R7RU:a_pop_masterpiece:j._r._baldwin_"lawnsmyth"	This truly is a masterpiece of pop music. There is not a wasted moment. The songs all blend together majestically one after the other. You really must listen from beginning to end to get the full effect.	1
B0000AKCLS:musical_prodigy:ken_r._lemhouse	Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place.  As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended	1
B000002X3W:the_singing_brakeman_!:mcgivern_owen_l	"The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" is highly recommended for any serious country music fan. If anyone is the genuine article, it is Jimmie. Listeners will recognize some old favorites among the tracks including "Frankie and Johnny", "Mule Skinner Blues" and "T for Texas".  There are also fine versions of "Waitin' for A Train" and "In the Jailhouse Now" though some may prefer Jerry Lee Lewis' version of the former and the Webb Pierce recording of the latter. The most interesting tracks are less well known.  These include "My Old Pal", "My Old Sunny South by the Sea" and one devoted not to a mother but a father (!)-"Daddy and Home". For this reviewer, the album hit its high point on the final track, a mournful "TB Blues", a reference to the disease that took Jimmie's life at 35. While Jimmie's yodeling style may not be for everyone, this reviewer considers this album a safe bet.  Keep in mind that JR was elected to both the Country and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Further, the "Essential" series of albums rarely disappoints. These almost always sponsor well- produced compilations of our past heroes best efforts. "The Essential Jimmie Rodgers" certainly falls into that category	1
B0000DJYO6:great_cd!:j._phillips	I love almost all of these songs on this cd. If you want songs that grab your every emotion...this cd is for you! I also recommend their other cds also	1
B0000BWVOJ:badness:	This will be short.  It is worth the price of this album just to hear the Branford and Harry Connick Jr. duet Carolina Shout.  That being said, all of the other tracks on this album are excellent. From Jungle Blues to Doug Wamble's solo guitar on Autumn Lamp, with this record you get a pile of blues and at the same time gain an appreciation for Romare Breaden's art.  A must have.  Branford keeps outdoing himself	1
B00020QWHS:supergrass_are_following_the_beatles_path_into_the_new_millenium...:j._magana_"night_driving"	...yes, the Beatles by which I'm not comparing Supergrass to them. No, Supergrass are riding the road built by not only The Beatles, but other British rock'n'roll greats like The Kinks, David Bowie, The Zombies and many others. But the exploding energy of Supergrass delivers a deeply satisfying listen that does not exist as frequently in the present 2000's. This will definitely be a group that will represent the virtouso side of British rock'n'roll of the 1990's and 2000's, and without doubt represent the Bohemia-Intellectual-Hard Rocking spark that has lighten recent generations that has been going on since Circa-Sgt. Pepper. An intoxicating and highly addictive album. 100% recommended for anyone any age.	1
B000001UKU:this_cd_is_supertight:victor_saragoza	Buy this CD now if you don't have it, it is an instant classic. The beats are banging, and fit Cougnut and C-Fresh's lyrics perfectly. The lyrics are tight, and touch on many different things. &quot;The Last Breath&quot; is real life song about death and injustice, and decisions we all have to make in life. &quot;Protect What You Hustle Fo&quot; is gangsta, about the individual struggle/hustle. &quot;Tell Me Something Good&quot; (remix) is even better than the West Coast Bad Boyz version with Master P. Its about real life in the ghetto	1

B000002AF0:a_fine_place_to_start:michael_l._knapp	The first four albums are so unbelievably great that for me it's almost impossible to say one is better that the others. Taken together, they are almost like one long album. The Family That Plays Together shows the band turning a slightly more commercial corner without sacraficing any of their artistic integrity. Their blending of styles is a bit mote intergrated than on the first. Randy California's influence on the music was becoming stronger as well. One thing that differd Spirit from most of their comtempories was the strength with whch they were able to convey their songs in concert. I saw the original version 11 times and they never failed to astound me. It's a shame that the only legitimate live recordings of the band are of the later Ed Cassidy/Randy California version. Not that the later versions of the band weren't great - they just weren't quite as good as the original band. If your'e just being introduced to Spirit, The Family That Plays Together is a fine place to start	1
B0001DMWWK:another_great_tom_russell_cd:daydream_believer	If you want to learn about Texas music just buy this disc.  Tom's love of life and artist's eye infect every song.	1
B000FQJOZQ:a_relentless_tech_mix_that_starts_off_with_a_bang.:doctor_trance	This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.	1

B000001HHE:artie_shaw's_top_hits_on_one_album.:	A top quality recording with all of Artie Shaw's favorites.  Artie's music as fresh today as when it was recorded - with the power and appeal that hits you right between the eyes	1
B000000OS7:what_do_you_call_that_noise?:roy_pearl	It's a testament to the noncomformity of the era that XTC's quirky debut album had the band initially lumped in with the late 70's first wave of British punk rock. Those were different times, after all. You couldn't find a teen punk these days who could make head nor tails out of the herky-jerky, spastic wit of &quot;White Music&quot;. Come to think of it, not many people could make much sense of it back then, either. Andy Partridge's elastic vocals refused to clearly enunciate any words with more syllables than &quot;pop&quot;, and Barry Andrews' keyboards were more an attempt to interrupt rather than complement each song. Nevertheless, the album worked. It rocked in its own art-damaged way, and fearlessly toyed with the sacred relics of the previous generation. That lone strum of a single chord at the beginning of the Fab Four's &quot;Hard Day's Night&quot; was cleverly appropriated for the intro to &quot;This Is Pop&quot;. A few songs later Dylan's &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; got twisted into ominous goofball paranoia. There may have been more intense punk artifacts from the Class of '78, but not many were anywhere near as smart as &quot;White Music&quot;	1
B0007D4MNQ:im_having_a_goodtime_too_ha_ha_ha_ha_ha_haaaaaaa:voicekoil_"john"	Its a pretty good mix, good song choices, its mostly a harder mix, thought it could be smoother flowing though, but all in all its pretty good, also thought the robot walk to the party deal woulda made a better begining, it was a lot of down time during the middle of the cd, but hey people gotta switch it up now and then, like the last 3/4s better...	1
B000001DYZ:realistically_tff's_best:john_a._reid	Which I suppose I'm not allowed to say, what with the worldwide phenomenon that was Songs From the Big Chair. But I think it's right. Roland took the opportunity following the breakup with Curt to make an aggressively postmodern record, and return to the steely-eyed austerity that the lyrics on The Hurting always suggested.  Indeed, this album is continually proving to be ahead of its time; as a previous reviewer noted, "Goodnight Song" has what has since become a familiar AOR sound. I call it the first "Coldplay" song, and it's fair to suggest that band would never exist without Tears For Fears.	1
B000000Y21:4_stars:ganu_"ganu"	Quite different from his later big-band recordings. Some of the songs that you may find on Wes' 'BEST OF' collections sound too much like elevator music. Not so with this debut album. A drummer, a organist, and a guitar player; no horn section. Stripped down in the sence of band size but very deep and articulate playing. He shows of his trade mark octave playing, his chord solos (played over the organs rythm chords none the less), and flashy runs across the fret board when needed. A good CD to start with for the guitarist who wants to play jazz.	1
B000J3FBVG:the_departed_soundtrack:jena_m._tuite	The Soundtrack is great but some of the good songs from the movie arent on it.  Overall it is a good produc	1
B000002IFR:a_nice_introduction_to_a_little_known_artist:patrick_earley	A friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of Chris Rea via this very nice Best Of comp. He also recommended getting his Road To Hell cd. Both of these cd's were money well spent. I'm surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the 80's when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity, mainly due to his top 20 hit "Fool (If You Think It's Over)". For some reason I never equated that song with this artist. The thing I like most about Rea is his musical diversity. He can lay down a very memorable AM pop hit like "Fool" or "Let's Dance" and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like "Road To Hell". No matter what the genre of music, this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove. There's plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd. "Auberge" and especially the wonderful "On The Beach" stuck out for me. But you get many styles here. And each song sets a different mood. From the easy listening "Winter Song" or the catchy "Looking For Summer". Or some excellent blues rock like "Road To Hell", "God's Great Banana Skin" or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off Rea's tasty slide guitar skills. I don't know how I missed this artist after all of these years. But I'm a new Rea fan who now looks forward to his next album. Whatever style that it might be, I'm betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb Best Of. This is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist. If your like me, after hearing this cd you'll probably want to search out some of his individual albums. I've since picked up his late 80's album "Dancing With Strangers". Another very nice cd. Most of the music on this Best Of cd is almost 20 years old, but it feels like it could have been written today. In other words it's well composed music that holds up very well over time. And I'm sure if your like me and not familiar with Rea's music, the minute you hear "Fool" or "On The Beach" it's going to bring the good part of the 80's back to you. Greatest hits cd's should all be this good. Highly recommended	1
B00000271Z:a_perfect_appalachian_honeymoon_soundtrack:	We bought this - on cassette - in Washington DC on our first day of honeymoon in September 1997. Having flown from Northern Ireland, it provided us with the perfect honeymoon soundtrack as we drove from  Washington to Nashville, along the Skyline drive, down through South West  Virginia, across Eastern Kentucky to Berea, and down to Smoky Mountains  National Park in Tennessee. We are from an Ulster-Scots/Scotch-Irish  background, and during those three weeks we fell in love with the land that  our forebears had settled in so many centuries before, bringing thier  fiddles and folk songs with them, creating what was the core of mountain  old-time music and bluegrass. From the Carter Family right through, every  song is a classic. You must buy this	1
B000005P6I:david_lanz_at_his_best.:daniel_saliba	Very rich in music, fully orchestrated and full of energy. I highly recommend this album for everyone who loves New Age music and to all those who like Classical Music. David took it to another level on this one. I myself like New Age artists that incorporate Orchestra to their music and that is why I loved this album. If you like this album, I recommend you to explore Yanni, Secret Garden, Giovanni and Bernward Koch	1
B0002XMFB2:monna_loves_your_stuff:david_tomasello	Better balance of songs on this Cd. This Cd shows growth in a the band.They are great fun live check them out if you get the chance!!!!!!!	1
B000002IZL:i_reallly_miss_inxs:foundmyhappyplace	Sorry, ya just can't replace Michael Hutchence. This is a great overview of all of their greatest hits.  I am not a huge fan of greatest hits CDs b/c people tend to buy them and, therefore, miss all of the excellent songs that weren't released as singles.  All INXS CDs are worth buying separately. But, if you must.....this will work	1
B000026MH0:the_last_roxy_music_album...:marcs	This is Roxys last gasp...I mean "wheres Eddie Jobson??" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there	1
B000007440:anonymous_is_wrong:glenn_peach_"peaches"	I love this album but the other review from Anonymous is wrong. this cd is not remastered. I baught this cd because of that review and got burned. The cd even says right on it AAD. in other words analog recording/analog master/digital playback. I will say this much though, the transfer is better than MCA's version which I own. However, If you want a remastered version of the song Monster look to the "All Time Greatest Hits/Original Recording Remasterd" cd From MCA. It also Has Move Over from this cd, I Love this cd and want it remastered. If you gotta have this album (I Do) than this version sounds better than the MCA version	1
B000F1IPQA:memories:g._holmes	This arrived the other day, I pre ordered it. Two of the greatest songwriters ever in my opinion. Its about time this was available on CD and here it is. Sounds great! Go get it for the collection	1
B000002TRT:unforgettable_:shalom_freedman_"shalom_freedman"	What makes a voice distinctive and memorable? Nat (King )Cole I believe had the smoothest voice of any male singer. Clarity and a sureness in phrasing was also gifts of his. Aside from 'Unforgettable' the songs I best remember are 'Mona Lisa' and 'Nature Boy'. But this recording also includes originals of the 'Nat King Cole trio'. It also includes  the famous duet put together of 'Unforgettable' from his early version and his daughter Natalie Cole's recording made after he had passed on. That particular recording was a 'knockout' sentimental and beautiful.	1

B000006Z63:this_album_changed_my_life:"axiom20"	It all started when I was a little kid and my dad gave me this album (he wasn't a fan, he probably picked it up with a crate of used records.)  It was one of my first exposures to rock and roll.  Nearly 30 years later I still own the original vinyl (the one that had the exploding fire extinguisher rooster album cover.)  I am glad to have it now on CD, the vinyl being about as scratched and pitted as can possibly be and still be remotely playable.  I dissent the reviewers who praise DuCann over Crane, for really, it IS after all Vincent Crane's project (Crane, also organist for Crazy World of Arthur Brown.)  A keyboard player myself I consider Crane one of my biggest influences and I hold great admiration for his playing.  DuCann and Hammond also deserve praise for their performances, but it should be painfully obvious who the star of an organ driven rock band is: Um, the audience ... er, no the organist!  Take a trip back in time and enjoy this classic work	1
B00002SWSO:a__virtual_textbook_of_jazz/blues_guitar:	I can't say enough how great this album is. Grant Green was one of the most soulful jazz guitarists who ever graced the planet. His soloing on this CD is filled with beautiful melodicism matched with a bluesy grit that is such a pleasure to listen to. And for me as a guitarist it has been an encyclopedia of how to play blues from a jazz perspective. My favorites are &quot;Miss Ann's Tempo&quot; and &quot;Blues for Willarene&quot;. It is such a shame that he died so young and never collected his just due	1
B000002VLZ:bravissimo!:leikinsky@aol.com	Forza Eros!  May you live to make much more great music! Whether you  understand Italian or not, I heartily recommend this CD. In Ogni Senso  lives up to its billing- it delights each and every one of the human  senses, in ALL &quot;sense&quot; of the expression. This is a must-have for  any true music lover	1
B00005YP9I:something_more_then_what_you'd_expect.:theseus_the_glove	Sombre Romantic is a step up if you will in the gothic metal genre. It is a very solid album from start to finish but has alot of layers that keep things interesting. Its not what you would really consider to be a "religious" album but there are many undertones that help get the message across. This point being made very clear in "Museum of Iscariot" which talks of Jesus from Judas' point of view.	1
B000001IHL:instant_tranquility:eternalseeker	This is just a great CD. Whenever I need to restore inner harmony after work, or dealing with any upsetting situation, this is the one I go to. Instantly I am transported to the calm, soothing setting of a traditional Japanese house and garden. It is fantastic for meditation, too. Let all the nonessentials of life slip away while you listen to this beautiful recording	1
B0002QO4B8:trippy:jenn777	I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get "Out Louder", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought "End of the World" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.	1
B00007M5CO:pure_lounge_music:carlos_climente	Trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this CD at home. Bajo Fondo Tango Club is not as pure tango as Piazzola's nor as chill out percolated as Gotan Project's, which makes them a band for all publics. Nor even one single person in my office couldn't help download at least one song of this CD into their ipods. Three of them already bought their copy	1
B000A2H8VC:i_bought_this_album_on_a_whim!:erica_reid	I was in Walmart's electronic area (which is where you can usually find me!) and I saw the album. I heard Unbelieveable and I was sold on that song but couldn't find the single. The album on first listen was not my favorite, but after a while I started liking it. It is a great album and I'm glad I bought it. Talent is a virtue!	1
B0000DBJAJ:so_wonderful:tom_benton	Many musicians release some sort of experimental album at some point in their career.  For Peter Gabriel, every album is an experiment.  Usually musicians experiment by deviating from the norm; however, on Gabriel's fifth experiment, SO, the ex-Genesis frontman does the exact opposite.  Gabriel, beloved for always doing something different, decided on this album to play it safe - and for Gabriel, that is an experiment.  Previously he was a sort of cult performer, but on SO, Gabriel finally made it into the spotlight.  Big time.  SO was an immense success, peaking at number one on the Billboard Top 100, receiving overwhelmingly-positive reviews (in 2003, So placed 187th on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time), and resulting in a sold-out tour.	1
B00004VW2M:frampton's_best_studio_album:	EXCELLENT SONGWRITING, GUITAR PLAYING AND OVERDUBBING. ANOTHER LIVE ALBUM FOLLOWING HIS FIRST WITH PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SONGS NOT ON FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS SUCCESSFUL AS COMES ALIVE.  DAYS DAWNING, CRYING CLOWN, FANFARE ARE A FEW SUCH SONGS. A FEW SONGS FROM WIND OF CHANGE, SOMETHING'S HAPPENING, AND EVEN A COUPLE FROM HIS EARLY DAYS WITH THE HERD WOULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO A SECOND SUCCESSFUL LIVE ALBUM RATHER THAN THE I'M IN YOU ALBUM WHICH WAS A TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT	1
B0002M6AO6:excellent:a._immel_"sojourner"	ALways loved this group....own several of their CD's and this is by far my favorite.  Darryl Hall's phrasing of his songs are superb.	1
B000001Y5X:a_great_first_album:darkhaven_"(mainly_horror_fiction_&_herbals_-_wheelsofterror.com,_darkhaven,_fictionaddiction.net_reviewer)"	From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.	1
B0000028RG:great_overview_selection:mary_j._davis_"mojodav"	Bought this CD for my daughter, a new Bill Withers fan and she loved the whole collection! It's a great compilation of classic Bill Withers music	1
B000002KEH:great_dead_live_set...:tupac_wayne_gacy_"me"	but not the only one you should get.  Make this a purchase, but get live/dead also because it has all different songs, and then look at other live releases.  The dead have a lot of good recordings, just pick and choose among them.  This one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection.  It is amazing how many good songs they have, and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff, but you can't go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn't up to scratch	1
B00002S82N:beginning_of_the_plastic_sword_saga:gorkamorka	Really, this is only worth 4 stars if you can appreciate all things cheesy. This is, of course, funny stuff. Really, it's the kind of music where you don't want other people to know you're listening to it, but oh my is it fun!	1
B000KLNLE6:rick_"shaq"_goldstein_says:_"coco"_is_"ok!"_"ok!":rick_goldstein_"rick_shaq_goldstein"	This CD is well worth buying. But to you blues aficionado's who rely on Shaq's recommendations, let me put it in terms you'll understand. Coco is no SRV, or an Albert, or a Buddy. He's definitely a large step below them. But he is also not a lounge singer type like Smokin Joe Kubek, Lil Ed and the Blue Imperials, etc. Coco, is a large step above them. This CD seems to pick up steam with each song.  He shows his flexibility with different types of guitar playing on a number of songs. He performs a great ballad, with a Johnny Copeland, song (#6), that's 5 minutes and 59 seconds long. (I could have said 6 minutes, but Shaq don't fool around when it comes to da blues!) NEW, GOOD BLUES IS HARD TO FIND, and till "Jumping Joe" Bonamassa dedicates more of his recordings to true electric blues, this is one of the best of the last year, along with Walter Trout's "Full Circle"	1

B000003FD9:pure_delight:ying_lu	As always, opinions vary in terms of who is the master at recording timeless pieces of music such as these Bach cello suites.  Starker himself pronounced in the sleeves of this CD that this edition, the 4th recordings of these music by himself is not "technically perfect", but in many ways, his most mature interpretation. You can spend hundreds trying to find a Mercury copy of "the perfect" rendition; or you can appreciate the little imperfections of an aged artist, at the height of his humanistic understanding of music, and of life.	1
B0000032ZL:a_great_variety_of_music_from_the_70's:	I have listened to the cuts from this CD and was amazed at how quickly it  transported me back to the time.  There were several tracks that I was  delighted to see since the artists were not popular enough to have an  entire album re-released.  If you are in a mood for a good dose of  nostalgia, this is the set for you!	1

B000003RY7:better_than_great:lhb	What's more to say about what may be the best "rock" album ever (especially if you consider the "My Kingdom" EP to be the second disc in a two disc set)?  The most emotionally wide-ranging album from one of the best bands ever.  Who else has ever made music like FSOL?  The Beatles and Fripp&Crimson are the only possible contenders.  I've never heard anything that does a better job of juxtaposing the terrifying and the unbearably beautiful.  If I could pinpoint the one disinguishing feature of all FSOL/AA releases, it would be (as a line in "The Isness" goes) "...[a longing for] inexhaustible ecstasy." It's all the more poignant on this album because of its being interwoven with themes of terror, paranoia and a sense of unrecoverable loss of something without which life isn't worth living.  It sounds hokey, but just opening up the booklet while listening to "Her Face Forms in Summertime" and reading the scrawled message "things are getting f*&ked up round here" makes my eyes a little watery.  My CD developed a 2 second glitch and I just ordered another one--this is so incredible that nothing less than perfection will do.	1

This ia a lovely little gem of a CD, and it is so pleasing to find John Adams, another great modern American composer. I'm also a fan of composers such as Christopher Rouse, for example, and Joe Leniado Chira is my cousin. Modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore, demand more of and nurture. We afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre. Meanwhile, John Adams has impressed me with this disc. The Chairman Dances is my favorite. I can just see Chairman Mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this, and Tricky Dick feeling jealous. This might be the music that opened China to the West	1
B00000FDHE:4.5_stars:_quik's__best_album,_production_wise...................:the_specialist	I think his debut had the best lyrics.

B0000646VF:a_fantastic_overview:	This CD provides a fantastic overview of Rypdal, who has been recording for ECM for 30+ years now.  The tracks range from pieces with an &quot;electric Miles&quot; sound to an orchestrated track.  While very diverse, the tracks work well together and are unified by his unique,atmospheric tone and excellent compositions.  The infamous ECM sound quality is even better due to 24 bit mastering.  Informative liner notes as well.  Highly recommended	1
B0006SSRXS:a_transition_album:chase_m._turner_"the_wiz"	The previous review has a few inaccuracies I thought I'd correct. First off, the beats on all of Atmosphere's albums, including this one, are produced and created by Ant, not DJ Abilities. Ant does not perform live, and so Slug often used to perform with DJ Abilities (and others). This may change in the next album as Atmosphere now includes a band soon to tour, but it's extermely likely Ant will be included in the production.	1
1591791529:transportive_and_restorative:loves2read	This is one of the most beautiful, restorative collections of Celtic music I have ever heard.  Haunting, sublime harp, cello, guitar, flute, and soundscapes create an atomosphere of serenity for meditation, prayer, or simply unwinding the mind and emotions.  The poetry which originated each selection is included and provides a meditation in itself.  Highly recommended	1
B0000CNY41:the_ex-yessman_takes_his_b3_on_the_road_with_a_new_band:k._lewis_"thrasher"	David Foster, who wrote a few tunes on Yes's "Time and a Word" is here on bass with Tony Kaye on the B3 and it's the performance of their lives captured live at the Rainbow. A brave but good way to record a debut album, album was produced by Jon Anderson and the cover drawn by Roger Dean, just like Yes. It gives you feeling that Tony left Yes on good terms when Rick Wakeman stepped in	1
B000286S8S:the_ultimate_rock_album!_:saeed_a._siddiki_"saeed_the_homer"	I was very young to really appreciate the in-s and outs of this band and the members between SAMMY, Roth and EVH!  I honestly can consider myself a newbie to this time-tested rockers.  I just downloaded this off of iTunes and i can tell u folks, every track is amazing! its like when Lars (Metallica) said once: "i was always amazed with G&R"...if i may borrow this line, i had always heard of the great EVH vs. Hagar vs Roth but honestly never appreciated this Guitar work before today! EVH is an amazing talent and it will continue to influence i am sure allot of new artists. My brother in Law was debating with us about Slash, Sammy, EVH, and Edge (U2), Clapton  and apparently they all chose EVH.  I didn't believe it till i heard it!  EVH is an inspiration. Anyone interested even remotely in any of these guys in EVH's history, should get this album because it is truly harnesses from almost all the worlds EVH has been to and in!	1
B00000EWFU:joyful_sounds,_not_slicked_up_for_american_ears:eric_pfeiffer_"musicmad"	This record is a fine example of earnest juju music.  Other artits have tricked it up some with synths and keyboards.  Chief Commander Obe has always managed to offer more traditional representation of juju as it evolved from highlife.  Keep in mind, this means amazing percussion work, intertwining guitar lines, loving vocals and long well developed instrumentals.  If you're interested, you should buy it.  It will make you happy, no matter how you were feeling, and what you're doing	1
B00000I5YU:really_shows_tracy's_best_work!:chris_"chrisfloyd11"	Good CD, but where is his recent hit &quot;I Wanna Feel That Way Again&quot; and his classic hit &quot;Walkin' To Jeruselum&quot;	1

B0008F10Y2:def_jux:transformer_"fkcommercial"	ANother hot release, top 5 in 2005 so far. No one even metions track 7 produced by one and only El-Producto and track 8 by belief. Hot cd recommend to those who don't listin to bull	1
B000026EM0:good_disc:mistermaxxx@yahoo.com_"mistermaxxx"	I Dug The Soundtrack better than the film.The Music Sounds Good Through out.if the film had have just focused on The Music it would have been Incredible.The Musicianship is Solid Here	1
B000000506:back_to_basics:hugh_springer_"the_known_original"	This is from the days when you had to be good to grab a mic. Lyrical wizardry was the order of the day, if you had no skillz you stayed away from the mic. The production is as tight as the lyrics on this album both were made for each other. BUY THIS!!!!!!!	1
B0000CF2ZI:perfect!:lovblad	The original Jack johnson LP was my favourite Miles record. I also had an expensive Japanese CD but all this would not prepare me for what I discover here. Over these CDs one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made. This is simply wonderful. Ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time	1
B000001UK5:4_and_a_half_actually:	This album is the shyit, cougnut and c-fresh deliver, the only problem you might have with this album is figuring out which one is cougnut and which one is c-fresh, but as you listen you will tell differences. &quot;Back in the days&quot; is real old album, so audio can be bad for a couple of the tracks but there isnt a weak track on this album. The beats don't get too bass heavy untill &quot;Hillary&quot; after that song the next 4 tracks or so are very bass heavy, but the flows are tops. These guys are the definition of gangsta, and is a must for anybody who likes gangsta rap. All guests are sick to, Dre Dog,Cellski,Chewy,R.b.l,2.2 and Mack and Al Kapone. Definetly a classic	1
B000EDWM5E:great_music:ahmadku_"avid_reader"	Herb Alpert has done what few artists can do. He's taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original.	1
B00000G15I:buy_this:t._awan	A ridiculously good album. This is as good an introduction to Jawbox as you're going to find. It's got most of their really great songs, plus some live songs which are great. Another good thing is that Desoto Records (the label that was started by the band) has re-released the CD, so it shouldn't be as hard to find	1
B0000003VP:uplifting:::::_lily_::::_"::::_lily_::::"	Disappear Fear's music is both calming and uplifting at the same time.  I especially enjoyed "Laws of Nature" because of it lyrics.  (It has a gay-rights lyrics)  Does anyone know which one of the singers is gay?	1
B00004UDET:close_to_perfect:m._bayne	I bought this for my wife, a huge fan of Patrick O'Brian (she's read the books twice in the past two years alone). Ironically, it now sits in my car's CD shuffler where it undoubtedly gets the most airtime.	1
B00000I0KG:fabulous!:"fionasam"	I have been a fan since Valotte. and I like the other reviewers here, can't believe why this cd didn't receive the airplay it deserves!There must have been some politics in there, with Sean's cd coming out on the same day ( Yoko?) It is one of those cds that you just leave on and you don't feel like you have to go and skip over songs that you don't like! I love every song!! Especially "Day after Day"," I should have known", "I don't want to know" and my fav right now "Cold".. I hope that what I have heard is true that he is working on his latest now. Can't wait! Buy this cd.. you won't regret it	1
B00000266N:fantastically_lyrical:	I have been listening to this album for at least 12 years and it rarely leaves my CD changer.  I played the cassette version until it literally would not play any more, and it was one of the first CDs I bought.  A relative first introduced me to this album and of course &quot;Coming Up Close&quot; was the reason I bought my own copy. But I came to love each song and appreciate Aimee Mann as an exceptionally gifted songwriter.   It is a great &quot;Road Trip&quot; album and &quot;On Sunday&quot; makes the perfect &quot;Summer Song&quot;.  The mix is not mainstream pop/rock.  It is not a 1980's anthem, but it is one of the defining moments, for me.  The lyrics have meaning, which sometimes defies what the '80's were about.  The only other thing I can say is Listen to this CD!  I am sure you will find Mann's unique voice as captivating as I do. It is a definite must have for one's CD library	1
B0000037LI:staggering_virtuosity!:	Percy Grainger was a man of spectacular gifts. He was one of the most original composer/arrangers in the early part of this century. He was also a spectacular pianist in an age of spectacular pianists. This amazing CD  documents Grainger's formidible gifts. It cannot be over-praised. Both the  music and the performances are well worthy of any piano lover's attention.  Don't miss this one	1
B00000JJAU:the_very_best_of_bobby_vee:lois_murphy_"reading_mom"	The CD is truly the very best of Bobby Vee's works.  A delightful CD.  Even my college age children enjoy the music. Really worth the money	1
B000ERU8PQ:2006_top_3_albums:k._w._smith	If this album didn't come out at its destinated time, 2006 would have been one of the worst years for gospel music.  Outside of Kurt Carr's cd, this album makes singing gospel music worthwhile.  Donald Lawrence knows how to send out a group and bring in a new era of singers.  That's basically what this finale does, it brings into the forefront the future of the gospel music scene.  We have new artists emerging in Blanche (McAlister-not sure if she is going to just do the first name like MaDonna, Cher, Mandisa, ummmmm, think about it!!!!!!!!), DeWayne Woods (thanks for the testimony and great Sunday morning rocking song - this is hint to all church musicians sing this song when church is a lil dead and pick it up), The Murrills, LaJeune Thompson (sang girl), and Sheri from the duo of Ted & Sheri.  There are so many hits on the whole cd from God Is, God, You Are An Heir, Giants, Blessing from Abraham, Encourage Yourself, of course all of the older stuff.  One thing missing is Kelly Price should have guested on I Walk With God or bring back Stephanie Mills.	1
B000001UKT:one_of_the_siccest_ever_recorded:"stswepr187"	You won't stop bobbin yo head until its over.  I bought this when it first  came out and we still bump this at every party we go to and everyone is  happy to hear it, Cougnut is easily as good as biggie ever was, he just  never got the exposure that biggie did	1
B000002KLH:all_the_cuts....:old_school_babe_"rose"	This CD has all of the cuts that you remember from back in the day...you will love it...it is always in my car	1
B0001Z363W:awesome..._and_i_like_bls's_heavy_stuff_as_well:james_o'brien	If you have never heard Book Of Shadows by Zakk Wylde, then you may be suprised by this album. The two albums are similiar in that they contain a lot more acoustic guitar, and although I'm not saying that past releases have not contained emotion, HM VI contains more.	1
B000ALM1HE:best_album_of__2005:renauld_elder_"soulkontrola"	If you are looking for true HIP-HOP, this is a MUST for your collection. Four of the Best lyrist in the game is all on one CD. Quit buying those fake ass HIP-POP albums and get the real deal. From the production to mcing its all there.  Matter facts get 2 albums so when the first one is used up you'll have a fresh one in the stacks.	1
B000058T5E:creativity_all_over:king_reis	Jeff Beck is far from the typical rock guitarist. He never took the easy path of showing how fast or virtuoso he is. Instead, he is full of intriguing and explosive ideas that make you want to listen  to this CD over and over again. That's what musicianship is all about, and Jeff has plenty of it	1
B00005KIZP:great_music!:t._sheppard	I drive alot commuting to and from my job. This music has served as the perfect backdrop to an lovely Indiana fall! I'm sure I'll recall those colorful images as I continue to listen to this CD through the colorless days of winter	1
B000007NE5:this_is_a_great_mix_of_great_favorites.:t._distaso	While not every song my be my favorite, they really did a great job compiling the popular and favorites from the great 80s hair band days!	1
B0000026T7:play_anything.:heathcliff	I remember thinking when this film came out that few things in life were as cool as Lloyd Dobler. This soundtrack is also one of those things. This album for me, as for many I'm sure, somewhat reflected my taste in music at the time, and even now actually. Of course the biggie here is "In Your Eyes" from Peter Gabriel. Who hasn't that track touched at some point? This also confirmed my love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and here we get a slightly extended version of their classic "Taste The Pain". Toss on a few from Fishbone, Living Colour, and The Replacements and you solidify this soundtrack as a must own for the late 80's alt-rock lover. Not to mention the goods from Depeche Mode and Nancy Wilson (Heart). In fact the only thing that could've made this album any better, is if it ended with a "ding"	1
B000EMGA3U:funk_meets_experimental_dissonance:patrick_alexander	I'm not particularly familiar with Sonic Youth and the bits I've heard from their other albums haven't really grabbed me.  This does.  The rhythm section wouldn't be out of place in pseudo-tribal funk, the guitars are dissonant, jangling, sometimes hypnotically repetitive, and just plain weird, and the vocals are distant, airy, lazy.  Some of the best music I've heard in a good long while	1
B0000793VV:the_mother_of_all_film_scores...at_long_last!!!:charles_l._cron	This is a glorious recording of one of the most lyrical, haunting scores ever composed for a film. Each succeeding track is a treat for the ears, refreshing and invigorating. Neeley and Varese Sarabande should be congratulated for recording and releasing this hirtherto neglected gem.	1
B00004VW4U:flash_from_my_past:jackie_loves_variety	I owned this as an LP and played it over and over on my tiny, mono phonograph.  I loved it then and I love it now. Rainmaker, I'm On My Way Back Home and Love Is All That I Ever Needed would all have been sucessful singles. I Would Have Loved You Anyway is the only song I don't really like but the lyrics are unintentionally funny. All the lyrics seem more suggestive now than they did then but that's ok! The background singers get a tad tiring but Go David Cassidy! I don't care if it's the memories or not, I enjoy putting this on and turning it up	1

B0002E4YOM:what_a_piece_of_crap:amazon_woman	cheap, cheap, cheap- I know you get what you pay for, but 20 bucks(after shipping) is a lot to pay for nothing in return. The thing didn't respond to my guitar, and the store said that it's probably defective and to return it. But, you don't get repaid for any of the shipping, so it's hardly worth the effort. Buying this just resulted in headache and frustration.	0
B000H43UIS:terrible_quality:m._nicklin	I've never purchased a worse item - ever.  I bought three of them for the kids... and they are all scratched, damaged, and of inferior quality.  Buy this only if you hate someone	0
B0002E1UNU:zerogravity_orbit_guitar_pick,_medium_single:a._d._vanessendelft	The material is too stiff and forces the  pick too far out from my finger. It is also  more  'stiff' than a dunlop .60m	0
B0007WC84W:don't_waste_your_money:p._edmonson	I gave this item a rating of 1 star only because it was the lowest offered, otherwise it wouln't have even received a star. This item is extremely low quality and one of the valves was bent upon arrival, it stuck, the trumpet was not playable. We took it to a music store only to be informed that it was not repairable... I would say if you are looking for a quality trumpet, keep looking because if you purchase this, you may as well flush your money down the drain	0
B0006ZHMXM:most_absolutely_awful_guitar_product_ever:comfy	You know how when a regular pick hits your strings, you can hear the sound of it hitting the string, then after it releases and the string reverberates you hear a note?  Well imagine hearing 15 picks hit the string before the string produces music.  And the 15 picks are made of coiled wire.	0
B000KUEYHA:cute_but_poor_quality:sunshine_in_durham_"sunshine"	This is an adorable guitar and it's the perfect size for my two year old  but it's made cheaply.  The strings loosen after he strums it for a couple of  minutes which means I'm retightening the strings each time he plays with it. I  guess you get what you pay for (afterall, it  was only $14.99)!	0
B000A0FQ86:avoid:garren_e._tooker_"reindeer"	I'm a guitar player that decided to pick up the drums as a second instrument, and also to help in developing a better sense of rhythm.	0
478704	The videos are amazing! I would have to say better than amazing. The riffs, and solos that are taught are fun and work well with the level they correspond to, and I feel progresses well with a beginner and beyond at a consistant speed. The only problem is... that there is a grey area that overlaps the term beginner and intermediate so you may have to skip around the lessons to get on track with the course. For instance I decided to learn the riffs and practice the pull offs from the beginner DVDs and go straight into the intermediate levels of the course as the beginner sections where way to easy. But I would have to say if powerful riffs and electrifying solos is your passion then I know of no other course that will get you there quicker while having more fun doing it	1
B0002CZYIY:a_rehearsal_workhorse:aaron_rubenson_"frugal_tenor"	This is an excellent, general purpose microphone at a reasonable price.  I'm a classically trained vocalist, and I use the SM58 for rehearsal and "scratch" recordings.  It delivers clear, true, and warm sound under all standard conditions and requires essentially no fine tuning or signal processing.  I still prefer the crisp detail of a condenser microphone for formal demo recordings (my favorite is the Studio Projects C1), but it's hard to beat the simplicity and reliability of the SM58 for everyday use	1
B0006DPMU4:best_bang_for_the_buck:p._nies	Great sound, low listening fatigue. This does not over-accentuate low frequncies, so if you're looking for overly booming bass, this is not it. Note that it's an "open" design, so that you will hear environmental noise pretty clearly - it will not keep outside noises out	1
B0006DPMU4:best_for_your_bucks:philipp_n._streubel_"drphilipp"	I bought the SR-60 after a lenghty review on the internet. My goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget (around $80). I have been very satisfied with the SR-60. The sound is great, confort is incredible. Since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non-listeners. So if you are looking for first quality sound, low budget headphones and don't care to much about the looks, these are the ones to go with.	1
B0002E4YPQ:for_$[...]._i_am_always_in_tune!:d._reinstein_"marindavid"	This Chromatic tuner, powered by one AAA battery, has a built-in mike for acoustic instruments and a plugin for electrics.  The LCD dial shows the specific tone, lights red if too high or too low, and green when you have it just right. I have used it on several 6-string (acoustic) guitars, a 12-string and a 5-string banjo.  The results are incredible- reliable and true.	1
B0006PK7XO:cool_but_read_the_thing:	This drum set is awsome and affordable. It has a nice clean but deep sound, and works for any type of music. But since America now is scared of reading, It seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols, it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals. 5 star though	1
B000H460EO:great__value:proudpapa_"proudpapa"	I ordered this guitar for my 4 yr old grandson for Xmas after he became interested in my guitar.The company did a fantastic job and it was shipped and received in time for Xmas .The guitar was surprising detailed not like those plastic ones you see in stores with fishing line strings..these were real steel strings with an extra string just in case.The only draw back so far has been in keeping the one of the  strings taunt. There is an adjustment screw in the back of each tuning peg but if you constantly tighten it , it becomes loose..overall my grandson is completely amused with his "tar"and spends hours playing us  songs...thank	1
B0002M2U2C:great_value_-_good_equipment:bible_believer	If you're looking to start out in recording podcast, sound clips, or speech this works great. I bought the package for the stand which is living up to my expectations - great. The XLR cord works good with my condenser mic. I counted the mic as a bonus not expecting much, but for an inexpensive dynamic mic it does an adequate job. The package is definitely worth the 20.00 that I spent for it.	1
B0002M2U2C:great_value:o._lovitt_"clay212"	The microphone and cord are very good quality. The stand is solid and easy to adjust. Note XLR cord connector. An adapter is needed for 1/4 connection	1
B0002F7GX2:sq50_metronome:helga_a._wilking	The metronome was everything I expected.  I wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control.  The sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control.  It is not digital so one can easily switch tempos. It is light enough to be easily carried around.  What I would have liked, but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond 40 - 208.  Unfortunately, that seeems to be found only in digital.	1
B0002F7GX2:the_metronome_looks_differently_from_the_picture:jenny,_c.	Just bought the metronome from Johnson instrument, it looks quite different from the picture. The new verson looks sleeker, which is nice.	1

B0002GIRP2:good_for_the_price:phil_tchan_"http://philtchan.110mb.com/"	i have had this microphone for almost 3 years now, and it still works well.  the shock mounting has broken, but the actual microphone unit is still going strong.	1

B0002F5JF4:my_15-year-old_son_loved_them:phillip_prever_"phil_prever"	I bought these bongos as a Christmas present for my 15-year-old son.  He is very happy with them.  They seem to be well made, have skin heads, and are tunable.  We are very satisfied with this purchase	1
B0002E3FCO:easy_to_use:william_r._coughlan_"prometheus_unleashed"	This pop filter does exactly what it purports to; the flexible neck *does* sacrifice a bit of flexibility in favor of stability, which can be a slight drawback if (like me) you use it on a tabletop mic stand. Still, quite recommended	1
B0002E51RQ:play_like_a_pro_without_the_price:tc_george	This is a relatively affordable harmonica; it has a good feel- the holes are well spaced. Overall it is easy to play; whenever I am playing out of key or whatnot on another harmonica I turn to this one and it sets me back on track. Sounds great too	1

B0002F6SFY:lee_oscar_diatonic_harmonica:richard_m._truesdell	I am extremely pleased with the quality of this purchase and the featured capability to replace the reed plate if that should ever be needed, rather than buying a complete new harmonica.  I consider myself a beginner and wanted something that would be durable and long lasting for the money I had to spend.  I had considered the Hohner Piedmont Blues 7 piece harmonica set but after reading some of the customer feedback I decided to go for the Lee Oskar diatonics which are of better quality.	1
B0002E4YOM:fantastic!:c._a._sanders_"blue"	Wonderful little device.  Works very well, priced appropriately, comes with two AAA batteries.	1
B0002E4YOM:great_for_novice_musicians:deb_s.	I use this tuner for my violin.  I use the automatic setting and have found it very easy to use.  The "needle" on the screen shows if you are below or above the note, and once I put fine tuners on my violin, tuning became a very quick process.	1
B0002E376I:freakin_awesome:dean_lisi	Why pay 4-5 times as much for the same EXACT PICK?  Think about it... FENDER doesn't have a factory that MANUFACTORS PICKS?

B0002EQT5Y:learning_to_make_and_appreciate_music:joanna_daneman	Music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills. In any case, making music is fun, it's participatory and it teaches about rhythm, counting and doing things cooperatively. A collection of percussion instruments like blocks, and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids. Take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing. This is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot. It is also great for Christmas; bring the kids along to carol, and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement.	1
B0002D0CA8:bright_and_clear:c._chung	I had been using Martin SPs for a few months before switching to try out other string types, but nothing sounded quite as clear as the Martin SPs. They resonate well, and no other strings I've found have made my guitar sound just as full as the SPs do	1

B0009FUTNE:great_sound,_great_price!:wilhelmina_gaudy_"coolartsybabe"	I have 3 Danelectro Fab effects pedals. The sound I get from this overdrive pedal is much more than I thought I'd get for my starter collection. A couple, more expensive effects I purchased, made by another brand, don't seem to be any better than the Danelectro Fab.	1
B0006DPMVS:if_sound_clarity_is_important.:r._garcia_"match_book"	Whether it is listening to classical, rock, or hip hop these headphones deliver the clarity you do not experience unless to buy a $4000~$8000 set of speakers. At $100 you get the same level of quality. But a word of warning; these will change the way you listen to music as they will make your ears more discerning to the clarity of music. I absolutely love them.	1
B0006DPMVS:best_hundred_dollar_headphones_you_can_buy!:samuel_g._kutscha	These headphones are comfortable, simple, durable, and give some the the best playback I've heard. I have done a fair amount of studio work, and although you can get better headphones, they'll cost four or five times as much	1
B0002IHETU:great_buy:roger_d._brian	For the price, I expected a toy. I was surprised to open the box and find an honest to goodness classical guitar. The construction, fit and finish are impeccable. The sound is certainly not concert quality, but that is to be expected on a $50 dollar instrument. The tuning is reasonably accurate, and it is a pleasure to play. I have told me son about it and he is going to buy one for his son.	1
B000KUABZE:for_budding_mucisians!!!:jody_lynn_ernst_"mamamantis"	We got this for our 21-month-old boy, who LOVES music and was always trying to play his dad's guitars. It is the perfect size and looks just like his daddy's black accoustic. He absolutely loves it. The manufacturers were smart and put the tuning keys on the bottom of the neck, as not to draw too much attention (which helps maintain the life of the strings). My only complaint is that the bridge is not secured so it is always coming lose and falling into the body of the guitar. I keep intedning to superglue it on...Otherwise I think this is a great toy for toddlers who are into music.	1
B000EZKZMY:you_won't_be_sorry!:jem	This microphone is fantastic. I do online tutorials and have struggled with the audio portion of my videos for a long time. I've used desktop mics, headsets, lapel mics, nothing come close... Problem solved, period. The sound quality is wonderful.	1
B0002FOBJY:terrific_music_stand:history_buff	I bought this stand because I wanted the bigger lip for both my music books and my violin bow to rest on.  It works perfectly.  Very sturdy, very easy to adjust.	1
B0002NYEYI:very_good,_but...:steven_osburn_"steveo12251"	I'm dealing with getting old but I was surprised to find that I could no longer tune my guitar by ear. In fact, I was thinking the problem was with my old guitars.	1
B0002NYEYI:highly_recommend:wendy_apgar_sawyer	less expensive than the stores. dont learn to play an instument without it.	1
B000CSGIJW:pc_tape_deck:brian_g._maltman_"chiefmatie"	I just purchased the Plusdeck2c PC Cassette Desk to convert my old cassettes to MP3 files for further transfer to CD's.  The unit works great abit trying to see the exact position of the tapes while in a fast forward or reverse mode leaves a lot to be desired.  It looses it's place and you have to do some guess work to find out where the tape is actualy at, but that is only a minor problem otherwise it works great.	1
B000CSGIJW:works_well_but_difficult_to_install:k._figari	This product is great but I had to get a computer person and even he had a little trouble with the installation.  You can't have dial up interent with it as it uses the port.  Make sure that you have all the cables.  The seller was very supportive and available to answer questions	1
B0009I2MRC:works_fine:alan_edwards	Decent quality, and no issues with interference at this frequency. Cannot be beat for the price	1
B0002KZ8S2:ok_-_a_little_tricky_at_times.:prime_reviewer	This seems to work well but sometimes, it doesn't seem to read right.   I am a beginner - so take this with a grain of salt	1
B0002KZ8S2:boudaciously_great:chevy_built_ford_tough_"el_uno"	My dad and I wanted to play as a guitar duo, me playing on the twelve string acoustic and him on an ACOUSTIC BASS. His bass had built in electronics making it electric also. My guitar had a built in tuner but his didn't. Needing a tuner was must have. Buying this tuner was the best accessory I've bought yet. It's the best of all worlds. Good looking, easy to use, and also very small. I recommend this item to any who needs a tuner for their guitar	1
B0002H0D58:one_woman's_review:j._temple	I've been playing the violin for 20-plus years and the guitar for at least 10 years, so I guess you could say I'm a fairly accomplished musician.  As a musician, I have to say that this guitar is worth much more than its asking price.  It looks great and sounds even better, especially considering that it costs so little to buy!  I've owned several guitars and this one sounds just as good as any of the other popular brands.  It's easy to tune and hold its tune just right.  The proportions are nice, too, and fits nicely with my small hands.  I'd recommend this to anyone, especially anyone looking to learn and practice.  The black color looks great, too.  By the way, I ordered this guitar on June 5th and it arrived to me on June 8th -- talk about fast!	1
B0002GXJXM:what_are_you_waiting_for?__twenty_bucks_--the_price_of_a_cable!:john	Surprisingly decent sound for something in this price range!  And loud enough to fill an ordinary room with sound; hard to believe it runs off of a 9-volt battery.  You can also plug in a Walkman headset.  In contrast, the Pocket Rock-It costs more and is headset-only; no loudspeaker.  The three knobs on top are volume, tone, and distortion.  It comes with a fresh battery and it has a belt clip so you can wear it.  It's a good value and takes up very little space.  I kinda like the nostalgic pastel colors, like a blast from the past	1
B0007WC84W:the_best:mw	do not believe that last one  i have purchased this exact horn and it is works great so far the sound is wonderful it looks great and it stays in good condition if you take care of it this horn is one of the bes	1
B0002H0A60:reliable_-_bright__-_quality:gregory_lawrence_"greg_lawrence"	I have used D'Addario strings exclusively for the last 20 years. I can tell you from comparison that they are much louder and fuller than GHS Boomers in the same guage and more reliable than whatever might come stock on a new guitar.	1
B0007U9SOC:excellent_product__for_both_professional_&_non-professional:orange-man	The introduction in the owner's manual states it perfectly.  Rode said that when looking for a good camcorder microphone, they were either horrible pieces of junk or super expensive professional models and so they decided to design a mic for this purpose.  This model strikes a perfect balance.  The quality of this mic is excellent.  It is very sensitive and has good directional properties so it rejects noise to the side quite well.  Although not meant for picking up sound from long distances it can do quite well from 20 feet away and maybe more.	1
B0002D0CFS:my_dream_pick:bando	I know a lot of guitarists aren't near as picky about picks as I am.  So why should you be?  After all, there is no pick that will make you play better and they are all generally the same.	1
B0002E50CM:my_favorite_harp...:scott_pointon_"former_marine,_librarian,_woodworker"	Back when I was learning to play harmonica I tried many different styles and brands before discovering these Golden Melody harps.  I really like the sound they produce and the ease of "bending" notes, even for beginners.  I also really like the fact that all of the edges are rounded, making it much more comfortable on both your mouth and your hands.  I know many of the greats swear by the "Marine Band" harmonica, and to tell the truth I wish the Golden Melody had wood instead of plastic edges, but I choose this one as my favorire based on the results I get with it.	1
B0008JGX5O:thrilled_teenager_actually_hugged_mom:vicki_e._pomeroy	Although not the model and style requested by my son, my musical background lead me to review and purchase this guitar instead.  It is of fine quality and my son is thrilled by his Christmas gift	1
B0002E363C:excellent_quality:w._riggens	These bright-colored bells are right in tune, and the little tune book has easy to play music for beginners.  They are color-coded, and have both numbers and keys on the tops to guide you in your playing.	1
B0002E1NNM:it_depends...:d-18v	There's NO SUCH THING as a "best string".  From experimenting over the years, I've found that, while I have "old standbys" that will be the first thing I try, often there is a string that is just right for a particular guitar and it varies from guitar to guitar.	1
B0002E2KOI:nice,_neat,_firm....works_fine.:just_a_reader	a good bargain for the money.  rapid shipping and good customer response.	1
B000A0FQ86:my_daughter_loves_it:cammie_sergent	My five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this. she loves it and so do we. it has volume control and you can use head phones with it. It has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts. she hasn't had any of the problems other people described with thiers	1
B000FMP9FY:trumpet,_good_product_at_a_great_price:hector_d._martinez_"pastor_danny"	This product surpases its price. Good quality item, sent on time and very professionally presented with its own case. A good buy overall	1
B0002M6CW6:good_strings:j._foster	Your brand of guitar strings doesn't really matter, as they are only a few locations, which manufacture all of the brands.  But the price of the strings on Amazon beats any music store	1
B0009I2JZC:great_zills_for_students:muneerah	I am a Middle Eastern dance teacher and bought these for my beginner students in class.  They are small and manageable and have a nice sound for the money...if you are looking for some inexpensive zills for beginner students and performers I recommend these.  I also ordered some for another teacher and the students loved them	1
B0002CZV82:great_pedal,_great_price!:craig_batte_"leggomycraigo"	This is a classic Boss pedal, it's been around for awhile.  Boss is known for their great sounding effects and rugged construction of their products, this one is no different.  The distortion from this pedal is simple, very smooth, and very versatile.  It's not too noisy, allowing single notes played to be heard with clarity.  If you'd like to hear it, you can probably find some sound clips of it being used on Boss's website	1
B0002GOJYK:greatest_picks_ever:sarah_parker_"sarah_j"	I love these picks because they have an easy grip providing less slippage when I'm really rocking out.  I like that they are flexible and still very firm.  This is the only place I can find these picks latel	1
B0008GIEAE:negative_ten_stars:evan_mcanney	This is a review of the Avery 3279 Ink Jet Dark T-Shirt Transfers. But I wouldn't be surprised to discover that the rest of the stuff they make is ALSO junk.	0
B000NBGW2G:falsely_inflated_list_price_and_"discount":guy_in_pants	These books are a good idea for the repeat visitor to a city-- basically just a place for notes in the lovely (I think) Moleskine format.  The maps, though, can be found better and cheaper on other places.  MORE IMPORTANT,  this seller has claimed a falsely inflated list price and consequent discount that is misleading.  The list price for these books is 17.95.  Check in any book store.  Shame on the seller	0

B0009VS6RE:not_a_good_set:van_lang_h._nguyen	The brushes and everything else are super tiny, only a child's hand can hold those. Not a good set at all. Rather just go to micheal's art store and get the sumi set there. Just stay away from this set, unless you you buy this as a gift for your 3 years old child	0
B000FNAZ0C:small,_cheap,_easy_to_use,_but_ink_does_not_come_out_very_well.:c._kim	Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often	0
B00016WPKG:cheap_build_quality:michael_espinoza_"mezpin"	I have owned this chair for about 9 months. The seat bottom has flattened out and has torn a bit -- I can see the polyfill inside. It is not particularly comfortable anymore. The chair also creaks a lot (as is typical with most inexpensive chairs).  It's a lot of money for a chair that has the build quality of one of the cheapie leather chairs that can be had for under $50	0

B000CN8TSA:well,_not_for_a_beginner...:melanie	You will still need either a good book or a friend to help you figure out how to hold the pen and make the letters.  This is just a kit w/ paper and pens and the pens weren't even that great.  No matter how you write they don't make lines that transition between fat and thin.  Might as well use a regular pen...	0
B000ID7QNI:no_rotation_adjustment:lcd_owner	I purchased this mount to hang a 15" LCD TV, weighing less than 9 pounds (the specifications rate it up to 33 lbs).  I carefully measured and used a level to mount the swing arm on the wall, but when I hung the TV, the position of the arms and the small amount of "give" between the arm segments caused the TV to hang at a slight, but noticable, angle.  You can tighten the arm segment joints, which helps the problem somewhat, but you won't be able to swing the arm around once tightened.  The swivel adjustments only allow you to change the side-to-side angle and the vertical tilt, there is no way to fix the rotation of the set.	0
B0008GNWXI:not_the_best:m._r._adams	Product description describes a tub of 108. The actual item is only 36 pieces. Not very happy about only getting 36 when the description stated otherwise. Additionally, the packing was covered in a layer of dirt so thick I couls not read the label	0
B00006IEIF:great_sharpening_but_broke_after_10_pencils:global_frog	I bought two sharpeners. I sharpened about ten pencils with the first one (excellent sharpening while it lasted), and something "let go" inside. The motor ran but the rotating blade had no more power - as soon as I pressed the pencil into the blade it would stop turning while the motor continued running freely.	0
B0001Q4BKI:waste_basket_collector:d._bishop	I've gone through three shredders but this one is the worst.  It's loud and jams easily.  The others were loud and jammed too but this particular one lasted me only three months.  When it jammed, power automatically shutdown.  I kept it in reverse and waited for power to come back about one to two hours later.  I'm kinda ruthless with the shredders, sticking papers with staplers, tape or dried glue, and I'm pretty impressed that the other shredders lasted so long.  Not this one, it came from planet pms and work only when it was in the mood.  I kept the baskets and placed one in each room.  Looking for the one I bought before this one.  At least it lasted almost four years.  Wish me luck	0
B00070QR2S:cheap_material:g._moore	I bought these and was disappointed.  The wire is very thin and flexible.  I would not hang any thing of value with these plate hangers.  There is not a plastic buffer on the holder either, so you would have metal rubbing against china or ceramic which can cause cracking or chipping.  Also, you are just purchasing the plate holder, not the special hook used to mount your plate. These are not worth the price they are listed for	0
54953	I first encountered Moleskine notebooks in a bookstore in London this spring, and what lodged in my memory was their marketing claim to be "the legendary notebook of Hemingway," et cetera. I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans.	1
54958	This notebook is fabulous...its history inspires.  I think that it will be the last type of notebook I use for my journaling and writing.  I adore it	1
123357	This shipper ("Moleskine Books") really went above and beyond what I would have expected.  They were pleasant to work with, quick to respond to questions, quick to ship, and really courteous from start to finish.  Awesome product, awesome seller, I'm looking forward to ordering from them again	1
123362	Are these journals a Five, or a Three?	1
161740	I searched for a simple, sturdy, reasonably priced and highly effective book stand for weeks. I've looked at pricey wood stands to poorly designed plastic stands with metal attachments. I bought the BookBuddy based on the student reviews and I have not been disappointed! I am a graduate student and a business consultant. I tote the BookBuddy to school, work and my home office without missing a beat. I love the ease and portability. You could pay more and get a lot less; buy a BookBuddy and you won't need to do either	1
209062		1
209068	Quite handy for sketching and doodling anywhere.  Sturdy pages accept some light watercolor washes, ink, and dry media.  Pages lay flat thanks to the style of binding, so it's easy to work a two-page spread of 5 1/2" X 7 1/2".  The expanding pocket in the back cover is handy for storing train ticket stubs, show tickets, receipts, and business cards (the phone numbers and addresses of good restaurants or shops discovered while exploring during trips sometimes come in well-desinged colorful formats that can be used to make collages or decorate journals).  A bit pricey, but they are the just right size to fit on any pocket and strongly bound to preserve notes and sketches through the rigors of travel	1
312601	This is the book many others attempt to duplicate but simply cannot. In addition to the cool little features like elastic band (keeps book closed when stuffed full of other found items & papers), the pocket in the back and the durable cover this is a very well made book. As a student of book making, this is a classic piece. Most books nowadays are a form of "perfect binding" where the pages are just glued on the spine. Needless to say this is as non-archival and non-durable as it gets. Moleskine's are done they classic way: pages folded and sewn together in signatures then sewn to the binding. They will last forever, which is why we still have sketchbooks around from the likes of Van Gogh, etc.	1
334123	I can't decide whether I bought this notebook despite the hype or because of it. But I do know that when I have a Moleskine notebook with me, I actually write. That is reason enough for me to be a loyal customer. No more journals started, then abandoned, and no more ideas forgotten because I didn't write them down right away.	1
334128	First, I'd just like to correct the person who said that moleskines have "no actual historical legacy". The Moleskine company may not have been founded until 1992, but moleskine notebooks have been around since before that. The company is not saying that Hemingway, Picasso and Chatwin used their brand of notebooks, they are saying that those people used moleskines.	1
463381	I couldn't believe what a hard time I had trying to find a small, hardback, unlined notebook with book-like binding! I'll admit that I bought this product because it was the only one I could find that fulfilled these requirements. But I am extremely pleased with the overall quality of this notebook. I am using it to record my favorite quotes and it is perfect for that purpose thus far. The only downfalls I can say may stem from the fact that I am writing in it with a fountain pen. The ink tends to "vein out" a bit if you will and I can't write on both sides of the paper because the ink is too dark. Otherwise I love the appearance of both the cover and the paper. I can't speak for how it handles for sketching. I also like the small pocket on the inside of the back cover. With shipping it is a bit pricey, but definitely a great product	1
463387	On the surface, it's just another plain notebook. Not much to look at, really. But there is something magical about the Moleskine. I can honestly say that this pocketsize notebook has increased my creativity, simply by being there to hold whatever I choose to put on its blank pages.	1
567877	Last year, I bought the gray female version of the Art S. Buck artist's model and I was very, very happy with it. It was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models I grew up with. It is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate, full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs, and that,  is scary bendy. The only problem with it is that the neck joint, although providing a good range of motion, is very delicate and broke not long after I bought it.	1
573648	Love love love the moleskin notebooks in every size.  So cool looking and just get cooler as they get beat up.  My favorite size is the small one because I can carry it around in my bag so that I can scribble down any random thoughts throughout the day.  One of my unexpectedly best purchases!	1
B0008GIEAE:you_can_get_one_at_officedepot_for_$12.99:supafriends_"babygirl"	This is a great quality product. Best quality transfer paper I've ever used. It's pretty expensive if you buy it here though. You can get this same exact product at your local Office Depot for a cheaper price plus you don't have to pay shipping/handling	1
B00069DKVQ:it_is_what_you_make_it:andrew_s._rogers	I discovered Moleskine notebooks in London about two months ago and bought my first, a Small Ruled Notebook, about one month ago. It's not taken me long to become a convert to these little gems, since I've now bought my second Moleskine, the small address book.	1
B000F8VIWQ:a_decent_product...:robert_j._oehlbeck_ii_"rob_with_a_kick"	The X-Pad is a decent piece of equipment, doing a good job of keeping my laptop from getting too hot. My only issue with it is the lack of padding on the underside. I'm going to have to attach a piece of neoprene or something similar to make it more comfortable to have on my lap.	1
B0006G2LBY:good_everyday_fountain_pen,_great_value:ray-vigo_"ray-vigo"	Since the Phileas came out a number of years ago, I've had 4 of them (3 fountain and 1 roller ball). These fountain pens have never let me down and have always been sound in quality. The first was the original red and blue series, the others were later blue and green marble models. They look nice and write very well. Many fountain pen users regard the Phileas series as the best place to start with fountain pens, and I agree with that. They're easy to clean, easy to use, and mine have always been ready to write for me. I whole heartedly suggest this pen as a fine addition to any pen collection, as well as for a nice fountain pen to use on a daily basis	1
B0006VRCCM:nice,_dark_blue;_not_for_writing_checks:s._blackwelder_"fountain_pen_daily_user"	This ink is popular with fountain pen enthusiasts. "Permanent" only means, "not washable with plain water." It is not waterproof, and it is not safe for writing checks	1
B000EP1Q0O:grandkids_enjoyed_this_gift:t._stratton	Bought this for a birthday present.  Feedback from by two grandchildren was very positive.  They liked it very much	1
B0006OM9XG:fits_the_bill:ronald_p._weber	I needed black storage containers to match the components of my home theatre system. I bought a new TV and stand that held all of my components. When I did that, I sold my old entertainment center which housed all of my CDs/DVDs. The storage boxes fit nicely onto my TV stand with my other components and they were priced right	1
B00067X0O0:every_little_aid_helps:marilyn_e._bransom	As a "senior adult" with both arthritis and Parkinson's Disease, I need all the help I can get. My handwriting has become virtually impossible to read because it is so small. Trying to read my grocery list in the grocery store is sometimes a real guessing game. The Pen Again writing stylus is a real help. I am still adjusting to the new finger placement, but I do believe it is an advantage	1
B00004TS5Y:so_handy_to_have_around:k._caldwell	I have had this laminator for almost 5 years.  It works great and is so handy to have around.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a laminator	1
B000BI5AMY:needs_slight_improvement:j._duncan_"poodle_girl"	As said by previous poster, it does not close once filled. If it is place in between books on a bookshelf, it is fine, but left on a desk, it looks messy.	1
B00069DL1A:great_diary,_delivered_promptly:emily_nicholson	Moleskine diaries are great - I've bought one each year for about 4 years now. This one was delivered quickly and cheaply - good deal all round	1
B00069DL1A:old_layout_has_returned!:anna_creech	If you didn't like the new layout in the 2005 edition, you'll be happy to know that the 2006 edition has gone back to the old layout (2004 and earlier).  I didn't mind it myself.  Mainly, I like the size of the whole thing - it's an inch shorter than other pocket calendars, so it actually fits in my pocket without sticking out too much	1
B00006IDPG:works_well:food_fan	I like this paper better than the HP paper...the HP paper seems to stick together more in clumps of pages.  The Office Depot paper looks good when I print on it.  As for the other reviewer's comment about holes, I don't know what she's talking about, I write all over this paper with different types of pens and it has never been a problem	1
B0007OSLYG:great_shredder_zero_issues_after_several_months_of_use:daniel_j._seliger_"barker_fan"	I've had this shredder for many many months now and it's performed perfectly. Zero issues. I'd highly recommend for daily at home shredding	1

B0006HXJCS:stylish_yet_sturdy:readalots	I discovered Parker Stainless Steel Ballpoints as I was finishing up graduate school in the mid 1980s. I was first attracted by the Stainless Ballpoint's classic stylish looks.  (I prefer the gold click & clip model, but have also used the complete silver model with pleasure.)	1
B0007GB862:good_ink:ray-vigo_"ray-vigo"	These cartridges contain Waterman's reliable black ink. They flow well and the ink dries fairly quickly. They're very convenient as they just snap in.	1
B000GLVRVY:these_are_superior_pens_with_a_touch_of_class:scott_fs	My expensive pens were always getting stolen at the office, but I wanted a good pen at an attractive price.  The Parker pen 'Jotter' fit the bill.	1
B000FNAYYY:pilot_is_the_best!!:s._hudgin_"tink"	I have used Bic and Papermate ballpoint pens for years. However, I finally got tired of them not working half the time. I was at my Doctors office one day and used the girls pen at the front desk to sign in. She had this Pilot G-2 Gel pen. I loved the way it wrote and the way it felt in my hand. It has a rubber grip and you can see when you are running low on ink. It writes the first time and evertime right out of the package. Not at all like the Bic and other ballpoint pens. I am hooked, I will never go back to ballpoint pens again. I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $2.50 for a two pack. They also have the refills for them also. Unless you write a bunch these two will last a long while before you need to buy refills for them. They came in Red, Black, Blue, and other colors also. I got the blue extra fine point. I highly recommend these Gel pens.	1
B000MH0JO8:beautiful_cards!:marie_dimacali	The cards are beautiful and reflect the care that was taken to design and assemble them. There is a good variety of colors and styles. However, there is a lack of cards appropriate for male recipients. The cards are mostly for female recipients. Nonetheless, it's a great product and I enjoy giving these cards to others for special occasions	1
B000FD7C4E:great_product:jenny_"jen"	I purchased this about a month ago and am not dissapointed! I have a desk job and sit all day. My desk is old and the chair cannot reach high enough so my arms are in the proper position. I have always had neck and shoulder pain from sitting improperly. This cushion straightens out my posture so everything is in proper alignment. I have not had any back or shoulder pain since I got this. Highly recommended for desk jobs	1
B000GLP0TY:mini_weekly_planner:c._bruggeman	It is slim and perfect size for a purse or pocket. I like the calendar in the front and the notched half circles for ease in finding pages. Good service, too	1
B00006IE59:love_it.:jack_(nmi)_stecker	I have an Ipaq that I love but the stylus storage awkward.   Seems to work sell in all modes and love the ergo design	1
B00016WPKG:the_best_chair_i_have_ever_owned_by_far!:j._black	After several years of using, and ultimately destroying, a variety of cheap ~$50 "leather executive chairs", I got tired of it and decided to do some serious shopping. I went to Office Depot's web site and staring me right in the face on their main page was a sale ad for this chair. Only $99 instead of the ususal $140, it said. $100 was about what I wanted to spend, and being a large indivdual, I thought it was serendipity. So I go to my local store the next day and they also have it marked for $99. I take a seat in their display model and instantly fall in love. It feels huge compared to my previous chair, a model by the same manufacturer, but cheaper and not as sturdy. I take the tag to the front to checkout, and decided to read the store's sale ad while I wait for a stocker to get my chair down from the back with a fork lift. I look in the ad just to see if my new chair is in it, but it's not. I was pleased to discover a note saying that I would recieve a $20 gift card with my $99 or up chair purcahse. Excellent, I though, but it got even better when the checker simply deducted the $20 from the purcahse price instead of giving me a gift card. So in short I was able to score this completely excellent and most comfortable chair for only $80!!! It's incredible, seriously. And the lumbar support is excellent. I can sit in this chair for hours at a time and my back doesn't hurt at all. I highly recommend this chair if you are a bit on the larger side like myself and find other desk chairs inadequate for your needs	1
B000A24I74:a_genuinely_worthwhile_item.:sorokahdeen_"sorokahdeen"	The Molesking plain reporter is an excellent notebook in many ways, without doubt one of the best on the market.	1
B00015YRF8:very_efficent..:tiffani_m._bassett_"pax_myrranda"	Okay I may not be able to spell but I get all my cards and bills out on time thanks to this wonderful organizer. It is just like picture. But a little taller than I expected, but it fits fine. It arrived promt and in perfect order. It's great.	1
B00015YRF8:excellent_product:amber_uncapher_"organized_mom"	This product came in excellent condition. I think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another. Everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch! The only assembly I had to do was to re-adjust the plastic dividers. I ordered it May 25th and received it May 26th. Very fast shipping!! I'm very pleased	1
B0006HVHRC:this_is_the_chair:anthony_garcia_"ownage_supreme"	This chair was my best buy of 06'. I've had it for a few weeks now and I must say I love this chair! It was moderately easy to put it together, it's sturdy and most of all it is COMFORTABLE! The high back is why I bought this.	1
B000K69JVA:the_greatest_marker_ever!!!:	This item was the best product that I ever bought! It really works. To blend 2 colors you have to put the tips of the marker into the chamber and twist the markers. You can also mix 3 colors or 4 too. It's worth the price.	1
B0008GNVG6:dee:sweetpea	Contrary to the previous reviewer, I love Tazo Awake tea.  I drink several cups each morning to help me "awake."  It is a dense rich tea, unlike the grocery store varieties (Lipton, Tetley, et al)---try it and you will see the difference.  Also quite good iced, I usually pour what is left in the teapot over ice to drink with my lunch.  Quite good.  I wish it was more widely available, but look for it, it is worth it	1
B00067X4PK:super_pen_redesign:g._hearn_"idziner_saratoga"	this cool looking pen is also stressless!	1
B000CN8TSA:great_fun_for_school-aged_kids:joanna_daneman	Ok, so they don't teach penmanship anymore. Kids are more likely to type before they write. But suppose you'd like your kids to at least have a knowledge of decent handwriting. It's good to practice loops and curves, but calligraphy can be a fun hobby and a great way to get artistic. This set comes with nibs, cartridges, color inks and projects. Sit down on a rainy day with the kids and make placecards for the birthday party, for grandma and grandpa's anniversary or just copy out poetry. This is a great teaching tool and some kids find it a wonderful hobby. A fun thing to do: take two pencils and rubber-band them together. Have your child pick out a favorite line of poetry. Take the pencils on a piece of Bristol board and draw curlicues and lines representing the poem and then fill in the lines with the poetry using the calligraphy pen. Erase the pencil marks with a gum eraser. You have a very distinctive work of art	1
B000G600CQ:wow:	This is the best ever!!!!!!!! It's so much fun to blend colors. If your planning to get a set, get the EL Grande kit because it's pretty cheap and it's the only set with all 24 pens and all 12 fusion chambers. This is so much fun!!!!!!!	1
B0006VR1EQ:a_smooth_writer_and_a_great_pen!:linda	I use fountain pens everyday, so I know what I am talking about: This is a great fountain pen for everyday writing -- one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price (unlike the average (non limited edition) fountain pens, which can cost over $100 -- and sometimes much more). The Pilot Varsity pen lays down a great fine-to-medium line of ink, and the nib (IE: the writing tip) does not dry out too fast when left uncapped -- and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir. Fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either!	1
B00067X9IW:great_pen!:pat_c._harman_"pat_harman"	While it looks a little odd, this pen is really comfortable to hold and use.  Come to think of it, it is good that it looks odd, nobody "accidently" walks off with it.	1
B000BJOYKC:for_budding_artists!:andrea_winton	I bought this for my niece for Christmas and she ripped it open and began drawing immediately. It was perfect to get her started	1

B0000AQONP:not_a_good_deal:randolph_g._town	after paying shipping handling and taxes it was cheaper to buy these locally	1
B0000AQONP:best._pen._ever.:laura_a._hidalgo	I love these pens. I don't really have much more to add than that. They write very smoothly, uniformly dispensing ink without blotches or bleeding through to the other side of the page. They make writing a true pleasure. And they're cheap enough that if you lose one, you won't go nuts...although sometimes I do because I just love them so much. Get them at Target, they're 2 for $2.50, while most places sell them for twice that price	1
B00094EGDE:satisfied_with_lamp_and_buying_partners,llc:arthur_thompson	Lamp is nice.Gives excellent lighting for desk work.Buying Partners,LLC was very good in handling a lamp that had problems with the bulb not staying on.The only downsize to owning this lamp is that the 13 Watt bulb can only be purchased at select stores .Seems like discount stores don't carry them.Also,replacement bulbs are expensive( most likely it would be cheaper to just replace the whole lamp than just the bulb).Some reviews on the bulb say that it does not last as long as the 10,000 hours advertised.	1

B00094E8TG:halogen_desk_lamp:w._ford	Good buy.  Heavy, but had to add rubber/plastic "feet" on bottom to make stable, keep the lamp from rocking, and scratch desk top.  Good reach with 22" arm, can adjust lamp up and down and move arm to sides, but can't angle the light to side.  All-in-all, a good lamp for the price	1
B00067X4PU:great_once_you_get_use_to_it.:bonnie_g._magar	I bought 6 pens - one for myself and one for 5 others on my Christmas list. It took me (left-handed) and my left-handed daughter longer to get use to it - it skips a lot for us. However the right-handers seem to have no problem and one of them who writes a lot in a journal says it is the best pen he has ever used. His hand doesn't cramp or get tired like with a regular pen	1
B000E7DFH4:wonderful_product!:heidi_swart_"heidis"	I am particular about paper cutters/ trimmers. I have used many over the years. This is like the traditional guillotine cutter but with a laser light to guide you as to where you should be cutting the paper or photo. This gives a very clean cut. No burred edges, no paper getting caught, straight line exactly where you want it. I do not recommend the small personal paper cutters with fixed blades that push/pull. I also don't recommend rotary blade cutters. Both of these type of cutters get blunt quickly and are quite frustrating. They are also difficult to line up exactly where you want to cut. They purport to cut through a few layers of paper, but this is simply not the case. I find it difficult even using one page in these cutters. After not very much use - such as one or two batches of whole page photos, they quickly give you burred edges and the blades need replacing often. They tell you the grips are large and easy to use, which is definitely not the case. I find the grip of this particular trimmer to be much more comfortable and user-friendly. I also really love the laser guidance. I highly recommend this product to any person that uses it for home office or personal use.	1
B00078BBGM:saves_me_a_lot_of_work!:wingingit_"carla"	This mop is fantastic.  I have no idea why I can no longer find it in stores.  I can mop my floors & walls with it with ease.  I do not have to worry about my two year old slipping on the wet floor.    It leaves it virtually dry.	1
B00006IFIR:convenient,_cheap.:james_stein_"miedvied.com"	The markers are dark and clearly visible, while the eraser is fairly thorough. The box comes with a plastic-molded container (as you see in the picture), with double-sided tape for easy, stable, mounting on a wall beside the whiteboard. For the low price, this is unbeatable	1
B00006IEIF:excellent_sharpener:c._keener	I use this on high-quality colored art pencils. They are very soft and shatter on ordinary pencil sharpeners with blades. This sharpener uses gears instead of a blade and sharpens at the same angle as other sharpeners that use gears (those with blades sharpen at a different angle). This is a replacement for my first one which lasted ~10 years and saved me ~$100 worth of pencils (these pencils are about a dollar each). I will not use another style.	1
B00008HBY8:great_for_media:a._floyd	Literally destroys cds, dvds and floppy disks.  I was surprised when it chomped its way through the floppies, metal and all and left nothing but little pieces. As far as paper is concerned, I would use an other kind of shredder such as a confetti type as this one you have to fold the paper so it doesn't always shred in small enough pieces.   If you have media to get rid of, there is no better little shredder than this.  I keep it next to my computer and it doesn't take up much room so it is very handy to use	1
B000AR7EYS:best__yet:just_me	I have tried many types of stainless steel cleaners.  This is the best I have found.  I actually saw it in a dept store and they were USING it for the cleaner.  It was not available for purchase there.  I have only found it on line.  It is well worth the price.  Several of my friends and neighbors have switched to it now too.  It really cleans, without streaks.  It lasts a long time too.  Love my stainless, but it requires a good cleaning product like this one	1
B00067X9KK:even_more_comfortable:kotik	I have the original version of these pens, and love them, but this one is even easier to write with.  I had to learn to write with my off hand due to nerve damage, but with this pen I can write with my primary hand.  With this pen, my off hand writing is more legible too!  Winner all around	1

Fantastic buy; and with no muss-'n-fuss of having to refill the pen either! [One of the reviewers below stated that these Varsity pens are not "real fountain pens" but are "in fact ballpoint pens": This is NOT true in the slightest, so I assume the writer of that review must have gotten his pens confused, since all of the Pilot Varsity pens are absolutely TRUE fountain pens.	1
B0001Q4BKI:no_problems!:j._a._borden	I've been using my shredder for more than 4 years, and I love it. I was looking around the websites because I just heard that shredders need to be lubricated, and I was looking for info about that.	1
B00006IFNA:the_most_coveted_scissors:philip_j._fry_"purge-atory"	Ain't that the truth? Your best friend will step over your dead body to have these scissors. They are so sharp and perfect for either lefties (like me) or righties (I'm guessing). Last time I had mine, they were all gunked up with tape, but even that did not slow down these super-sharp blades. They cut through anything: paper, hair, high-quality denim, several layers of tape, I've even cut through a staple with them	1

221440	The photo on Amazon isn't representative of the product I received.  The frame is white, or an extremely light silver.  I also bought a LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock, which didn't match it's photo either, but at least I like it.	0

350124	I was looking forward to purchasing this item until I got to the final step of the order process where it shows the shipping cost.  The cheapest shipping would run me 14.99 for an item costing 21.89.  Sorry WeatherBuffs, you lost a sale due to your ridiculous shipping price.	0
543597	The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck	0

B0007CXT7M:don't_waste_your_money!!!:becky_s._davis	I bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month. One night I saw a mouse running across my stove so I brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop. Later that evening I was washing dishes, and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of Shake'n'Bake RIGHT PAST THE RODENT REPELLANT FIVE TIMES!!	0

I was going to order a couple more to place around the room, but they walk right past it now! It doesn't seem to affect them at all! For $20 it's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people, it just didn't work for us:	0
B0002WZRL8:worse_clock_ever:a._sangkharat	aside from the nifty weather prediction, this clock is completely impractical.  The projection numbers are about 1/2 inch tall with minimal clarity.  The clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible.  I am surprise this is sold on Amazon.  Thank goodness for Amazon's customer friendly returning policy.  I think Amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good.	0

There were warnings with this product saying that it shouldn't be left outside, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. A couple months later, I discovered that my cutting board (left on a covered porch through a mild California winter) had completely split into several pieces. For a $30 outdoor product, this is really unacceptable. A plastic or metal cutting board would have worked much better	0
B000IB9RMI:worthless_product:crobinson	These lights don't hold a charge.  I called the manufacturer and they said that these are "summer/spring" lights that require 12 hours of direct sunlight to work.  The ad on Amazon did not say that.  I even charged the batteries using a wall charger and they still barely held a charge (1 - 2 hours).  They are also very dim lights.  Don't waste your money	0
B0001B509O:not_as_advertised!:jodi_l._seidenberg_"jodofarc"	This basket is NOT stainless steel as advertised.  It is merely chrome plated.  I returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the 'error was not our fault'.  Amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers.  I believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault.  This is not the level of customer service I have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with Amazon	0
B0001B4ZL8:nearly_worthless_junk:t._rubbe	This grill cover is pretty much as generic as you can imagine.  Not only is the vinyl material that it is made of thin and easily tear-able, the drawstring at it's base is very easily prone to breaking.	0

B0006MXPVI:not_up_to_webers_standards:ronald_d._foster_"ronfoste"	The grill is up to Webers usual high standards but I do have a couple of quibbles with it.  I bought the Q grill because I needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv.  Since every pound counts, the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel.  But an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface.  I don't have the time nor inclination to "season" a cast iron grill.  What I would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface	0
B0007RXD9Q:buy_flowtron_instead:k_maggy	I agree with the other reviewer, buy Flowtron instead. My Flowtron 40C lasted 20 years with the same bulb and never had a clogging problem with bugs. For the same price, the Flowtron 40D is a much better buy	0
B0007RXD9Q:more_irratating_than_the_bugs:h._eddie_sasser_"eddie"	On my second one now...Not that I liked it much the first time, just that it is the only brand they sell in the local store here.  I will say that while it worked, it worked...I mean, it killed some bugs!  These, however, are my problems with it:  Bulbs burn out fast!  Like after four to six months...And the replacement bulbs are almost as much as I paid for the whole unit!  The thing gets jammed up with bugs and there is no easy way to clean it.  Finally, it doesn't appear to be very weatherproof.  The first one died after a storm and the one I have now has just died.  I think I am buying a different brand on here...One that works for more than a few months	0
B0002WZRJK:many_problems:scott_tripp	The clock was off by -4 hours even after so called rebooting.

Its very frusterating when its a hurricane outside and you can't get any wind readings.  This junk cost me a couple of hundred dollars and was a very dissapointing birthday present for my husband!

B00077AA7O:dosen't_know_daylight_savings_time:robert_j._warren	I bought this in January and it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around.  Now it is an hour off (one hour less than it should be) and won't reset to daylight savings time.  There is a button that resets it if you don't have daylight savings time but it dosent do anything either. Removed and reinserted the battery following instructions endlessly but it is stuck an hour short until the fall.   No reply from the manufacturer.  Beautiful clock but useless half the year	0

I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up.  My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either.  Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow	0
B00008T95O:dissapointing:	The projection was too small and not bright enough.  The clock was a pain in the neck to set.  I have many of these type clocks and this one was a dissapointment.  I returned it	0

B0007CXT72:don't_be_fooled_by_these_devices'_claims!!!:consumer_advocate	These devices, tested by the FDA decades ago (including the ones with variable and intermittent pitches) do not work.  There have been a number of class-action lawsuits against the companies that sell these.  They simply don't, and can't, work against insects or rodents. It's science	0
B000050APG:absolutely_ineffective:	I was hoping it would repel roaches -- a common problem in NYC-- but this thing absolutely does nothing!! In the two weeks I used it, three bugs wondered into my place in the vicinity of this pest repeller.  Besides, you can hear the ticking noise of this device very well, like a clock	0
B0000A4XFF:what's_it_made_of:	We need a little more information.  The chair LOOKS great!  But what kind of material is it constructed from?  How big is it?  A side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves.  The price is good, now if I just knew a little more..	0

B000C13YUU:built_to_self_distruct:john_l._marie	I purchases this Gazebo and I thought it was a quality product, and found out after I erected it that it is made very cheap...The canvas looses color in about 2 months and the tie down clips for the top starts to rust and the elastic will stretch soon after....                                              Now when the wind hits the top it flaps and no longer is stable...             then the hold down clips one by one breaks off now the canvas top is at the mercy of the wind. I lost my canvas top one night and it riped off and destroyed the frame...to make a long story short..THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK AND DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON IT.....To make matters worse I contacted the manufactor and was told that they were no replacement parts avalable....	0

B00023CWWY:doesn't_fit_genesis_stainless_steel_gold_c_gas_grill:martin_gendell	Despite what it says on the Amazon web page AND what it says on the packaging itself, this does not fit my Genesis Stainless Steel Gold C Gas Grill purchased in April 2003 (it's about a half-inch too short).	0
B000LDIWJC:not_what_is_advertised:robert_d'angelo	The material and construction are good. I purchased this because the ad said it would fit a 9' tree. The bag is 6' long	0
B00005A3L7:will_it_ever_arrive???:m._giles_"mrsgorgon"	Shipping in 4 to 6 weeks?  Try 4 MONTHS (maybe)!  after waiting 6 weeks for it to be shipped, I am now told it will be another month or two before it ships.  A Christmas present is turning out to be more of an Easter present.   And no explanation given for the delay. I can't love the headphones if I never see them.	0
B0009JXYQY:poor_quality_control:c._giles	I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order	0

B00012YIDW:from_the_birds_point_of_view:r._tyssen_"sheetrock_gal"	I currently have two feeders in the back yard for the hummingbirds.  I love the way this one looks but the birds don't feed from it and I'm not sure why.  The other one will be empty and they still don't come to this one	0
120963	Just to make sure people don't make the same mistake I did, be aware that this is NOT compatible with the Weber Q 200 Silver Portable Propane Gas Grill. Amazon.com lists this rotisserie as an accessory for the Weber Q 200, so it is Amazon that deserves a low rating so I have just given this the current average of 4 stars	1
133845	I bought this clock last week.	1
133850	One thing which mystifies me is how few people have embraced the latest in modern clock technology: radio controlled clocks which keep exact time by automatically synchronizing themselves with signals broadcast from the incredibly accurate U.S. atomic clock in Boulder Colorado. Such clocks are not only always accurate to a fraction of a second, they also automatically set themselves to and from daylight savings and standard time as appropriate. Furthermore, such clocks are typically quite reasonable in price. Yet while most Americans have, for example, the latest in modern cordless phones and cell phones, relatively few have the accuracy and convenience of radio controlled clocks. This model is just one of many styles sold by Amazon and other vendors. Try one and I think you'll be glad you did. My wife and I have several of these clocks throughout our house and take accurate time for granted, no what time system is in effect	1
163871	This little scraper will get your grill cleaner than just soaking it in the sink.  It scrubs all the excess off with ease and leaves even the dirtiest grill clean.  Sturdier than any other brush I or my family has used.  The one we have now has lasted quite a long time.  It cleans each rail on the grate beautifully.	1
221445	Received after a weeks time. Per amazon this was supposed to be in Stock and shipped immediately. Clock is working good. There is no instruction maunal in the packag	1
262202	I found no issues.  I put the battery in and hit "ET" it set and is keeping GREAT time	1
262208	We bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new (used) motorhome. I wanted it so that I would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece.	1
265755	Keeps the ribs from searing. Lower profile than most rib racks so it is easier to turn rib	1
273664	Great looking and quite large. Easy to see from a distance, though the other two dials are correspondingly small. Updates quickly and automatically and is unfailingly accurate. I wish that I had a dozen of them. The price is very reasonable also. I certainly will buy more of these clocks eventually.	1
302649	Used it for a tri-tip last night and it came out wonderfully.  Cranked on high to initially heat it up, then we left it on low and it kept the 400+ degrees no problem (it actually got too hot according to my instant read thermometer!).	1
330605	Purchased the rotisserie basket after reading the other reviews. I have found the basket to work great. You put your meat in to be grilled and clamp down the pieces. Very easy. With Rock cornish game hens though, I needed to tie them a little bit, but that is because the little legs are . . .well little. Never had one before just the skewer kind. Cleans fairly easy too. Love it.	1
350117	It works in New Jersey, just wait a night before you say something else	1
350125	We had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves (and we know our directionals here).  So, if you get it, just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up	1
395351	The brush does a good job of loosening grit and grime from your grill, but you are still going to have to break down and wash the grill with soap and water now and then.  The brush has a strong wooden handle, leather loop, a sturdy set of bristles, and a grill scraper for tough jobs.  Be sure to buy this longer brush as the 12-inch one does not have the reach, especially for larger grills	1
482249	The clock set itself right away during the daytime and it performed very well from that point on. All I had to do is put a battery in it and hang it on the wall facing the general direction of Colorado and I experienced no problems with it then or now. I would advise anyone to get one of these clocks since they perform well and are accurate	1
543592	Really goes good in my room. I really like that it automatically synchronise as per the time zone and daytime savings...	1
543599	We bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new (used) motorhome. I wanted it so that I would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece.	1
549069	The description doesn't do this rib rack justice.  This thing is pretty big and will hold a LOT of chicken.  You will certainly not complain about running out of room!  Even though it might be an exaggeration to think it can hold enough chicken to feed the entire neighborhood, there's enough room here to hold enough chicken for a family of 7 or 8.  Washing it may be a problem.  Just wash it immediately after using it	1
549077	Bought this to use with my Weber Smokey Mountain.  I almost bought a Sunbeam rib rack for half the price at the local home improvement chain but it seemed a lot flimsier.  This rack is solid and built with Weber quality.	1
605497	I use a table top grill about 65 days a year.  The only one I can depend on is the Weber.  The only reason I replace it is when mine get stolen	1
605504	While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this	1
B00004YO3U:exceptional:j._benson	Had enough of cheap looking patio umbrellas that tear and bend after 3 or so thunderstorms?  Try this one!  Very nice design,looks great, simulated wood finish pole, easy open and close. We are very satisfied	1
B00004RAKS:weber_performer_charcoal_grill:bocadr_"bocadr"	Just received one for a housewarming gift. Have used it twice and am sure it's a "sleeping giant": WHAT A GREAT BBQ!!! A little messier than a gas grill and takes maybe 20 mins for coals to be white hot - start to finish - but what gas grill will get the temperature up to 700 deg!?? Talk about the ULTIMATE in broiling! Super easy to light - push-button ignites w/ propane in 3-5 mins, then wait 15-20 mins and go. Everyone's going to want one of these!!	1
B00004RAKS:best_grill_on_the_market,_by_far:r._wilson	This is the most awesome, wonderful, fantastic grill there is out there.  Everyone knows charcol can't be beat for flavor, but it's a bummer to get started.  Weber has outdone themselves by inventing this amazing grill. It is super easy to start the coals, easy to keep clean and looking fabulous, easy to empty the ashes, and easy move around the deck (out of our frequent Seattle rain).  And of course the food we grill comes out delectable.  I am grilling a whole chicken tonight using the indirect method.  A snap with this grill!  It is well worth the price.  WE LOVE IT!!	1
B000216X6M:a_better_concept:david_w._bates	Traditional grill brushes quickly clog with grill funk and the wires bend, thus rendering them useless in a short time.  This has a pad that fits any grill, and they can be removed and washed (or replaced).  Rated number one grill brush according to America's Test Kitchen	1
B00021FHQ4:great_set!!:barbara_l._williams	I bought this grill set for my fiance.  He absolutely loved them.  They are heavy and extremely sturdy.  I would definitely recommend them!	1
B000HBVNIU:extraordinary_stylish_piece_of_patio_furniture:j._l._olivier_"grosse_fatigue"	Very stylish looking chaise,no assembly required, not unlike Crate and Barrel Atrium, but at a fraction of the price, and maybe not as sturdy.. Made of fixed but flexible metal slats, like IKEA wood slatted base matresses, cushions are needed to use this piece of furniture -I was hopping not always. I bought also a couple of deep seating chairs (read review), the deep seating sofa, 2 ottomans and a couple of side tables	1
B00009PR1E:grill_cover:john_citron	I've used a lot of grill covers in my time.  This is the best - looks like it will outlast the last few I've tried that just couldn't make it through a year in the hot Arkansas sun!  Colors are neutral though green is more of an olive - but I didn't buy it for the color - bought it for the durability - course 6 months a trial does not make	1
B00009PR1E:professional_quality_grill_cover:james_w._lineberger	This is the best grill cover I have ever seen.  It is undamaged by most objects, including hail (which my previous one was not!)  It goes on easy and removes easy yet stays in place as it should	1
B00005MF8U:great_product,_but_add_a_metal_stem_thermometer_for_best_results....:ms._skewed	I've used my smoker for 7 years now and I have nothing but great things to say about it. One recomendation is to drill a small hole in the top and insert a metal stem thermometer (about $7) for accurate monitoring of the smoking. You'll get the best results when you can hold the temps at the desired levels. It also comes in handy for checking internal temps of the meat.	1
B00020Y3YM:high_quality_spatula:s._knavel	I recently purchased a Weber Gold Series grill and wanted quality grilling tools that complimented the stainless steel design of the grill. I decided on this spatula because of the quality normally associated with the Weber name and I was not disappointed.  The spatula handle is attractive and has a rubber grip for comfort.  The length of the spatula is great for reaching the back of the grill and for large flanks of fish.  I would highly recommend this spatula for anyone who is searching for a quality accessory to their Weber grill!	1
B000659JQK:a_complete_grill:brian_j._mckenna_"bmac"	This grill has it all, six burners, a side burner, a rotisserie with infrared burner and a smoker box with a dedicated burner.  The grill grates are 3/8" stainless steel rods that provide great grill marks on your food.  The grill heats up to 600 degrees in less than 10 minutes, but it does burn through propane rather quickly, but that wouldn't be any different with any 60,000 BTU grill.  I was able to put the grill together by myself in a little over an hour.  The fit of the pieces was fantastic and the end result was an attractive incredibly stable grill.  It has two pull-up counters with stainless steel inserts, and a cabinet with stainless doors.	1
B000659JSI:great_grilling:tweety	I bought this grill for my husband, as a Christamas gift. He said that it is awesome. He says you can walk away and not worry about anything burning. Also, he says that it heats the food evenly. The warming rack is a great asset too. Finally, what he likes most is that you can control the temperature for each side. Wow what a awesome product	1
B000659JSI:fours_year_and_still_going_strong:j._rauch	I purchased this grill for my husband four years ago and we are still very happy with it.  It has held up very well.  When we were having problems with it lighting the back burner, I called customer service and they were extremely helpful.  They saved me buying a whole new burner set by explaining to me how to remove the tubes, check and clean them.  We are now replacing the racks and flavorizer bars ($60.00) since they are just too hard to clean after all this time.  I have found replacement parts at Home Depot and Lowes which is a plus to know I can easily get the parts.  I don't see us haveing to buy a new grill anytime in the near future	1
B00008T95T:fantastic_-_quick_to_set_up_and_accurate:richard_f._schneider	I put in two AA batteries, went to sleep and the next morning woke up to find the time, moon phase, date and temp set and accurate. Very cool product. I hang it on a wall about 8 feet up and have no problem seeing the display from 20' away and from an angle of 45-50 degrees. It is not completely viewable from the sides, but there is no annoying ticking and it beats my $10 Ikea analog clock hands down. Good for a small apartment.	1
B000CDHOJU:tight_fitting_cover:james_r._jones	Well I like the cover, but I it is hard to put on.  I hoped that it would slip over the grill easily.  It does not, it is a tight fit.  The quality of the cover is excellent.  I just wish they made it a little larger so that it would go over the grill easier	1
B00004RBEI:weber_grill_cover:michael_p._costa_"mikeindabronx"	You can't beat it when all you do is unwrap it and use it!  The cover is a high quality, perfect fit product (odd shape and all) that looks great and fully protects the grill.  I highly recommend it&gt	1
B00004RALH:great_cooking_service:m._vo_"dfw_poker_ninja"	I thought these grates weren't good enough to sears meat, boy was I Wrong. The beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests. Easy to clean too	1
B00004R9VW:bk-40d_electronic_insect_killer:william_d._saumier_"bill_saumier"	I would recommend this product over to others.  No complaints	1
B0007ZGUK2:great_way_to_roast_chicken:c._atkins	This thing works great. I prefer to keep bottled beer on hand so I never had a chance to make beer can chicken. The chicken I cooked came out perfect. Crispy skin and juicy inside. Excellent! I'm going to dry lemon juice and wine next time. The bottom tray holds all the grease so your grill stays clean. Highly recommended	1
B00004RALJ:works_well,_great_value:peter_lin	I bought the grill for father's day and found it a great purchase. I've been thinking about getting a new grill, but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much. Even though the price of the go-anywhere grill is cheap, it is pretty solid. I've only used it once so far, but it works nicely. I can fit 4 ears of corn on the grill, 16 chicken wings or 6 teriyaki beef skewers. It took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple. the best part is the portability. I used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook, it started to rain. Thanks to the unpredictable NorthEast weather. Since the grill is portable, I picked it up and moved to the garage. Try that with a standup grill.	1
B00004YO3S:patio_umbrella_review_(sort_of):keith_a._stickley_"newspaper_guy"	The umbrella I ordered is fine, just what I had hoped it would be. However, I subsequently ordered an umbrella stand (after you prompted me to do so) and when it arrived the two tightening screws  in the shaft had been damaged in shipment. Each of the screws have plastic knobs and the knobs were broken off. As a result when one tightens them the broken plastic is sharp enough to cut skin. I have tried unsuccessfully to find replacements at a hardware store.  Any suggestions	1
B00004YO3S:great_product_great_price:alison_l._heilbrunn	I checked multiple sites and manufacturers for this type of product.  We are totally pleased with what we received.  The construction and fabric are all that we could have wanted at much more cost	1
B000659KEQ:bogus_btu:__this_thing_is_hot!:vsimmons_"vsimmons"	I heard that this grill was "only" 36000 btu, and was not as hot as some other grills.  Believe me, this puppy is plenty hot if all you are going to do is cook food!  Disregard this btu rating.  This btu rating is rubbish.  This grill will transfer so much heat to your food so fast that if you're not used to cooking with a high-quality grill you will turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol (I used a custom-cut 3-inch porter house to break in my new grill, and to my surprise, it was closer to well done than I prefer, but still DELICIOUS!)  Everything is high-quality.  It is much more solid than all the other grills I looked at, and the grill is very even in terms of heating.  Besides, it is beautiful.  The side burner was not something I was really interested in, but I just went for it.  I used it the first time.  THIS is the grill you need	1
B000659KEQ:2nd_one_in_20_years:p._sean_sullivan	I owned a weber for almost 20 years before weather began to takes its toll. This one is works just like the last one and I hope to get a least that much wear as it is stainless and my last one was not.	1
B00004VWM1:many_years_of_great_eating:e._s._petru_"photo_nut"	You may wonder why it took me 20 years to write this review... well after using this rotisserie for all that time, the motor finally stopped working.  So, I got a new motor this week.  And I'm ready to go.	1
B00008W71W:great_fit_for_my_new_weber!:happy_griller	I bought this after calling Weber to find out if it would actually fit my Summit Gold C4. It does...and that is what mattered to me. I can't comment on durability as I just got it, but it does feel heavy enough to withstand a beating	1
B0007CXT7M:works_great!:c._krams	This pest repeller works great in my attic repelling squirrels.  The squirrels have broken in three times and are gone within 15 minutes.  I would not use this inside the house because it does make a constant chirp sound.  I can't hear this noise in the attic, so I will buy another when this wears out.	1
B000H1SGPS:weber_grill_cover:jan_m._shortall	This cover works very nicely with my grill - it fits well, and appears to be fairly good grade material.  I have no complaints	1
B000EF1KB4:good_for_the_price:p._webster_"plain_reviews"	This a very basic smoker.  It is well built.  Easy to assemble w/ good instructions.  Not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information.	1
B000050AP8:much_better_than_others:	This sonic pest repeller works a lot better than others.  It will keep away a lot of rodents and decrease the number of spiders drastically.  You will start to see less and less spider webs and it does not make a whole lot of noise.  I would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers and is well worth the money for how much of a decrease in insects and creatures	1
B000EEZFEI:my_first_smoker:david_m._warren	I bought the Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker for my first smoker and the first time I used it, I cooked two Pork Boston Butt's. I have never used a smoker before and I was worried about the heat fluxuating,(I think thats how you spell it),alot. Once I got the heat set(in about 20 minutes) I put the two pork butt's on and left it till the next morning. I woke up and checked the temp and it was perfect. Everyone who had some of my smoked pork thought I was a proffesional at smoking with my Great Outdoors Deluxe Gas Smoker. I am doing some beef brisket this weekend to see how it turns out. Alot of people have been saying that thier Smoker was in bad shape because of the packing from the manufacturer but the Smoker I bought from Lowe's was packed in a cardboard box with foam supporting everything and nothing was damaged or scratched on my Smoker. I would recommend this Smoker for anyone that wants a Very Good and easy to use Smoker. OH Yeah' It's also easy to clean!	1
B00005B9XI:great_hammock:n._chen_"lostchild"	I got this hammock back in November, so I don't know if this hammock will be good for summer, but it is the perfect hammock for winter!  My fiance and I could nap in it all afternoon with a couple of pillows and a blanket in the middle of winter.  It is very comfortable even with 2 people on it.  The surface seems to be semi water resistance.  We left it out in the rain a few times and most of the water stay on top of the surface.  We just turn the hammock, dump out the water, and it dried under the sun in a few hours.  I read somewhere that the green stripes will fade over time, but I can live with it	1
B00008DHPA:mr_bar-b-q:r._ross	My husband was very pleased with this set.  It is the best one yet.  The handles are great to grip and the set is easy to use.  They wash clean easily. This is a great product.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves to grill	1
B00004OCIO:oxo_good_grips_always_impress:norman_guadagno	I always recommend the OXO line of tools to anyone that does a lot of cooking and wants something really designed for use. This is especially true for anyone with problems such as tendonitis, arthritis, or carpal  tunnel -- these tools are all designed to leverage energy efficiently  instead of wasting energy as most poorly designed utensils. Try them out	1
B00092M27I:very_excellent_hammock_stand:diane_pilato_"baja_mommacita"	After assembling the stand I was very pleased with my decision to purchase this one.  I also ordered an extension, thinking that for my Mayan family hammock I would need to make it longer.  But to my surprise, the hammock fit perfectly without the extension, and because the height of the stand can be adjusted pretty high, you could put a longer hammock in it because of this.  Very heavy steel, well enameled, excellent workmanship and very easy to assemble.  ***** - Definitely a five star purchase	1
B00008DHPE:bbq_stainless_steel_wok:holly_j._jorgensen	I received this just a couple of days ago and it works awesome!! I grilled bite size veggies in this and nothing fell through the holes. I still had the grilled taste but no messy cleanup or a hot kitchen. Excellent product!	1
B0000VYDJS:i_like_this_clock_a_lot!:digital_pen_and_ink	This was a replacement clock for one that fell off the kitchen wall. I was very familiar with this clock since I had the original one for almost 3 years. I like the look of this clock and I like the choices you have for different displays. Overall this is a sweet clock. I did not however give this clock 5 stars because when you try and "program" this clock it won't do what you want it to do, not sure if it how the owners manual is written, or whether the manual is out of date with changes in how to adjust the features	1

B000A0FXIO:projection_clock:mrs._lisa_c._phillips_rn_"cooter"	I ordered this clock for my Dad and he loves it. It is so easy to see the time on the ceiling and it keeps the correct time automatically. The indoor temp. is a nice addition. And the price is right	1
B000A0FXIO:my_family_loves_the_projection_feature_-_buying_more:mtn_girl_"mtngirl"	I gave one to my nephew for Christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and I now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband.	1
B0006MXPV8:great_griddle._just_need_more!:m._bowen	Just got to use the Weber Baby Q griddle. It worked great. The only complaint I have is that it could be bigger. It covers just a little over half of the available grill area. More would be better.	1
B0000VYJ06:superior_product:a._fletcher	I received one with my La Crosse Weather Station and placed it on the east side of my dwelling.  It provides a true reading unlike others I've used in the past.  I plan on adding 1 or 2 more sensors  for an even better reading	1
B000AEYGZQ:excelent_product:roberto_velazquez	The product work perfectly, and the displays are very good.	1
B0002803KC:fire!!!:michael_f._merriman	A great outdoor grill.  However you really need gloves to open it and load wood once hot	1
B000BIVK28:strathwood_umbrella_&_base:christine_m._tucker_"shopping_mom_of_four"	I ordered this on a friday and it was delivered the following weds. The base is heavy. The colors are very "in" now. A distressed Oil Rubbed Bronze pol and base with a taupe fabric.  Very nice. The umbrella opens and closes with a wind up handle. It is solid and put together well.  The fabric is thick and provides good shade on my SOUTH-SOUTHWEST facing rear lanai.  It was very easy to put together.  I am happy with my purchase of this set.  A++++++++++++++	1
B000BIVK1Y:great_chaise!:l._darville	I ordered 2 chaise and very happy with them. They are a little lighter in weight than I expected. Also, the image shows the metal a little lighter than what they are. The cushion looks beige in the photo and is actually more grey. Besides all that, they match very well with an Ethan Allen set that I have. Delivery was fine and they arrived sooner than expected	1
B000BIVK1Y:fantastic_buy!:j._meyer_"twin_mommy"	These lounge chairs are hands down the best deal that I have found. They are extremely comfortable, sturdy and attractive! Plus free shipping and they come already assembled..which is a big deal for me since I am not very handy!! Great item and great deal all around	1
B00005B0BE:good_product_but_i_liked_the_earlier_model_better:g._pompieri_"g"	I have a high ceiling so the display of the time was fuzzy and I missed the see-through case with the red night light on the earlier model but overall, I was satisfied with the clock	1
B00005B0BE:great_clock_for_my_7-year_old:l._battle	Purchased this so my 7-year old can wake up on his own for school.  I checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child (didn't want radio, CD, telephone, and other features).	1
B0000645RH:a_good_cat_doorbell_and_cableguy_catcher:technology_guy	I admit it -- sometimes I just forgot to check to see if the cat wanted back in. The Driveway Patrol fixed all that. Setup about a foot or less off the ground in a relatively sheltered location by the front door, it does a great job of watching the front of the driveay and the front door. I originally set the sensor up to look down the entire length of the drive but it proved much too sensitive for this to be useful so I aimed the sensor low ACROSS the driveway near the front door and this has worked out fine. It now tells me when the cat is ready to come in as well as when a pizza or package delivery has arrived.	1
B00004RBE5:looking_for_a_grill_cover_for_your_george_forman!!:	Well, look no further.  My apartment complex doesn't allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed.  I was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my George Forman Kettle Grill - I didn't want to lug it in and out all summer.  So, I took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly! I can now leave my George Forman Kettle Grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements	1
B000BIXAO4:worth_it:ms_j_"lmt/cmt"	Bought this with the Sean Conway Tiverton 2006 Deep Seating 4-pc. Chair set. Looks and feels great as a set. It was a chance worth taking..	1
B00077AA3S:works_great!:ajfjc	I've had this wireles temperature station for about 2 months now and I'm very happy with it.  I mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight (direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings).  The "base" station is usually in our kitchen, but for a while I moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room - the outdoor sensor never "lost contact" with the base.  The indoor temp reading is accurate and is within 1-2 degrees of 2 thermostats I have in the house, and the outdoor temp is accurate with 1-2 degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch.  I enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning.	1
B000EF3RS8:little_giant:steve_potter	There are probably more authentic ways to make real BBQ, but nothing any easier.  If what you like about BBQ is the flavor, not the work, this unit is for you.  Add water to the pan, chips to holder, put some dry rubbed pork [...] on one (or all) of the four grates, light the gas and you are good to go.  It holds temperature very well unattended.  Adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want.  Your friends will think you are a genius	1
B00018HTFK:great-for_the_price:jenifer_j._houck_"jen"	We had out of town guests arriving when our puppy had chewed our chaise lounge to shreds.  We ordered this chaise lounge cushion and it was sent to us immediatly, w/o special instructions to do so.  When we received it, it was a bit thinner than I wanted, but for the price and fast delivery, it was great!!!  The material is durable and of good quality.  Our kids have been laying on it with swimming pool water dripping off them and it's been out in the weather for 4 weeks and shows no wear.  Like I said, it's a bit thinner than I wanted, but a good buy	1
B00018HTFK:nice_item:m._jones	Cushions look great on chaise loungers, bright dark green in color. Cushion get very hot in the sun. Items arrive well boxed and well before promised date	1
B0006Q5UQ2:great_chairs:buddy	They are very attractive and we had no trouble putting them together.  Our only complaint - the stain ran during a rain storm and stained our patio	1
B0001B509Y:___price_is_right:richard_allen_housel	Price was right for the Grill piece. Only drawback is no real Grill location to use it	1
B00004TKJ5:worth_it!:garnette	It was more than I expected. It was easy to hang, looks good, and most of all it is as comfortable as advertised. Too bad I don't have more places to hang more hammocks	1
B000LRFUFW:tailgating_fun!!:tarheel4life_"heels23"	I got my Grill to Go Advantage just recently and have been very pleased so far.  The makers of the Grill 2 Go appear to have heard some of the criticisms of earlier models and taken that into consideration with this grill.  The open flame cooking is preferable to the previous models, it is still easy to transport, and it has made tailgating with friends before watching my Tarheels play basketball a lot of fun.  I completely disagree with the other reviewer who seems to be reviewing the wrong product since this grill does not use a non-stick cooking surface for the cooking area	1
B00004RAM4:silver_a_now_covered:m._irwin	great cover, heavy and well made.  fit's perfect.  it didn't come with any bourbon or beer though.  I was dissappointed	1
B00008W71O:holy_roast_chicken,_batman!:cheerytoes	Eating the chicken that this roaster produced was almost a spiritual experience! I had it for a month or so before I remembered to buy a whole bird and defrost it to use. Then I realized I didn't really have any beer on hand or anything, but the chicken had to be cooked, so I used what I had. I'm hear to tell you that putting a little Jack Daniels in the well (I don't drink it, I only cook with it) along with a little water and some tequila lime vinegar and then sprinkling the bird with cajun seasoning still produced an amazingly moist and flavorful chicken. I was astounded - it took about an hour to cook and the bird was juicy, tender and flavorful with a nice crispy skin. Do not walk, RUN to buy this thing. It's worth every penny and you're not getting weird chemicals from an actual beer can (with it's label etc) in your chicken, and as I just proved, the sky is the limit as to what you put in the resevoir. yum!!	1
B00008W71O:best_way_to_do_"beer_can"_chicken...:domino	My family and I love "beer can" chicken but I didn't like the idea of literally putting my food onto a beer can.  This Weber Poultry Roaster is so much cleaner and far easier than using a beer can.  The chicken remains stable too...no more trying to balance the chicken on a beer can.  And it's a great way to switch from using beer to using wine.  What a fabulous product	1
B0001B4ZL8:super_grill_cover:c._roshak	Heavy guage vinyl grill cover made specifically to fit Char-Broil 65 inch grills, covers completely, good quality. Nothing bad to say about the product, glad I purchased it to protect my grill in winter	1
B000066RVH:great_buy_for_its_price!:rkfromny	It took a long while to get this one, but it is entirely worth the wait. This hammock is wide/long and gets a high score for comfort. One thing I didn't know was that the hanging kit (hooks/chains) for this hammock has to be purchased separately (costs about $15). Despite that, I have to say that it is a great buy for its price	1
B000FSQ7MC:cute!:cynda_p.	I purchased this item for the offic gift exchange.  The golfers went crazy for it.  We have the kind of exchange where you can "steal" someone else's gift and this bbq set really made the rounds!  Nice quality and is bigger than it looks in the picture	1
B000BPMS36:great_product:ruth_t._moore	This is an easy device to set-up; it works great! I am very pleased with this produc	1
B000EEQ574:works_well:maynard_j._theresa_deguelle_"tree_hyg"	Works well, light weight. I wish it came with a light bulb changer like some of the other similar system	1
B000EEQ574:love_it:j._burgand	I was able to reach the top of the windows in my two story foyer with this wonderful product. I need to point out I am 5'4".  I did need the assistance from my boyfriend (who is 6'1") to reach the ceiling to remove the cobwebs...but he did it and they are GONE!	1
B00004RALW:quick_cooking_hassle_free:azmonsoon	The Good: Simple and easy to put together. Works as perfect as you would expect. Cleaning is as easy as using a brass brush occasionally. This little grill is a powerhouse, cooking most items in less than 5 minutes. Webber has world class customer service.	1
B00005NN9D:review_of_cable_free_thermometer:d._h._von_wittenburg	excellent product: my third experienced with Oregon Scientific products.	1
B000EPISCS:great_umbrella_for_the_price:cbddallas	This is a great umbrella - the quality is excellent for the price, and it arrived timely and packaged well.  The color is not a bright yellow, but more of a maize yellow, but coordinates well with my brightly striped chair cushions!  I think the more muted color will help keep it looking nice longer - I think a brighter yellow would fade and/or look discolored sooner	1
B0002U3V9A:nice_sturdy_table:max_kandler_"frontier_man"	I needed a big table to put my CPU, keyboard, screen and printer with room for papers and prints. The 8ft Lifetime table is perfect for my needs. It is sturdy, neat, attractive and portable. A must have for every home office.	1
B00004RALL:smokey_joe_sillver_review:william_leclaire_"back-yard-wanta-be-chef"	I used my last little smokey at least 3 days a week 6 mounths of the year here in MN for 18 years. I am only cooking for two so it works out perfect because you get the preformance of a Webber but you use verry little charcoal. Don't forget to shut the vents when you are done cooking, this smuthers the coals then you can just add about half as much as you would otherwise need next time. Getting a chimney gets your charcoal ready with only newsprint as your starting aid in about 10 minutes. As far as preformance goes you can't beat a Webber you can grill (no lid extreamly hot), or you can smoke or bake with the lid on. Read the cook book that comes with your grill and you will be an expert in no time. The only negative is they replaced the wooden handle with plastic.	1
B0009VCBB6:la_crosse_projection_clock:elmer_d._parks_"mr_wiz"	Works great.  I have wanted a projection clock for quite some time. This one works wonderfully and the cost was wonderful also. I still have not installed the outside sensor as I'm trying to find the "perfect" location.	1
B0000BXHL1:turkeys_beware_-_we_are_ready_for_you!:ladyluck5_"ladyluck5"	THIS TURKEY FRYER WAS A SUPERB PRICE COMPARED TO THE STORES- IT WAS DELIVERED RIGHT TO MY DOOR ON NEXT DAY SERVICE AND THE TURKEYS CAME OUT JUICY, TASTY AND I WAS TOLD TO NEVER USE AN OVEN AGAIN. IT ALSO MADE CORN ON THE COB, CAPONS, VEGGIES AND ZEPPOLES SO EASY AND SO TASTY.  i SET IT UP TO MY BARBEQUE GAS CONNECTION AND VOILA` IT FEELS LIKE MY KITCHEN WAS EXTENDED ONTO THE PATIO.  GREAT IDEA AND THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR SERVICE	1
B000HCNEWM:bbq_cover:thomas_e._contri	Heavy duty and sturdy cover.  Attachment to wheel to keep from blowing away in wind is great.  Vent pockets and storage pocket also very handy	1
B00018HTG4:great_cushion_especially_for_the_price:alison_l._heilbrunn	Nice fabric and construction.  Backordered item came 3 weeks before expected.  Fabric color was a little darker than it appeared on the website, but that can't always be helped	1
B000JLJATW:batteries_are_o.k.:thomas_petaja_"tom_petaja"	I am finding the batteries are doing better than most rechargeables I have bought.  Seem to have a good battery life.  No leaking problems.  If I did, I would just return	1
B0000AQL23:redifork:	Accurate and easy to use--just push the button amd insert. Better for grilling than oven work.A bit bigger than I would like but not too long-maybe a foot-and it does keep your hand safely away from splattering oil. Very accurate and sturdy.The on and off label has come unglued on mine so I need to reglue it	1
B000659KDM:cboudreau:c._boudreau_"'tooth_lover'"	We bought our Performer about 2 years ago from our local hardware store. It was the best purchase we ever made! Its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition....about 15-20 minutes you're ready to grill. For the people who own a gas grill and are considering the Performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal...its a piece of cake (we had our reservations too!) and you're going to wish you switched sooner. Food never tasted so good	1
B00021FHO6:mr_bbq_shish_kabob_set:b._donatelli	this is truely a must have. the flat non-stick skewers holds everything in place, they won't flop around so the unbalanced pieces of food are always on the bottom near the heat. a friend told me about these at gander mountain selling for $7.39 a set, but i checked here 1st and found them for $5.99 a set. i ordered 5 sets!! the skewers are 14" long for plenty of food. get yours today, don't wait. get at least 2 sets.	1
B00070OYLY:adjustable_table_:k._williams	This table with its adjustable height was just what I needed.  It's strong, easy to adjust, and stable after it's set up.	1
B000EFFS5I:great_item:amy_j_"amy_j"	This storage bench is great for storing pool items or anything you keep outside.  It was easy to put together and I got it on the Friday sale for $69.99, so the price was awesome!  All other benches like this that I researched were over $100.0	1
B00006WS5F:some_modifications:del_wong	I love my Brinkman's Smoker. But I did some modifications to get it in its present state:	1
B00006WS5F:the_best_backyard_smoker_available!!:don	This unit is easy to load, easy to maintain temperature, and simply cooks the best barbeque. I have not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker that can compare, dollar for dollar. You have complete control over how smokey the flavor is (or isn't). I only check the temp once every hour. I have done 5 full racks of ribs (on a ribrack), not &quot;babybacks&quot; either, plus 2 pork shoulders at once, and could have fit more! Use all charcoal, all wood, or any combination. I also use charwood because it burns so clean. I recommend ordering the optional thermometer which fits in the built-in opening in the right hand side of the big door. Holds up to 100 lbs of meat! Has a drippings drain on the lower right. Firebox is easy to clean, I use a garden trowel. Tomorrow I'm doing 2 racks of ribs, 10 lbs. of chicken wings, and corn on the cob... I LOVE IT!!!!	1
B00023CWJ2:fits_genesis_stainless_steel_gold_c_gas_grill:martin_gendell	After a few years of use, the original rack on my Gold C grill was rusty and unusable. This is the exact replacement and fits like the original, making the grill that much more usuable again.	1
B000657BRO:fine_product,_but...:rosebud	The hammock is fine, particularly for the great price Unfortunately, my pine trees dripped sap onto the hammock, which is a pain to get off. Not the hammock's fault - I guess it just wasn't such a good idea	1
B0009VCBCK:la_crosse_ws-9119u_is_excellent:teacher_"bob_l."	Set up was easy. Just read the manual and follow the instructions. Don't take short cuts.	1
B0002WZRJK:great_clock:fly_guy	The other reviewers accurately captured the clock's great features. I will add that its radio reception is great too.  I put the battery in about 6:00 pm in California yesterday, May 31, expecting it to get the correct time overnight.  I noticed the second hand move a bit and stop, and thought "d*** it's broken already."  Not so!  While reading the instructions to see what happened, with the clock resting on the floor, it started advancing to the exact correct time, having received the radio signal in a minute since start.  The clock is now in my office and I don't have to wonder if I have the correct time or not	1
B000E66NDI:big_comfort_by_the_pool_or_patio:ellie_"eilean_siar"	This lounge/deck chair cushon is worth every penny. It is thick, comfortable (none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion), available in several color choices, and has a soft, not plasticky, cover fabric. You will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit. It just barely fit my 'titanic' deck chair because I had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms. But all turned out well and I must say I am very happy with it. It is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper, but much thinner, types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer. Get the best. This is it	1
B0007ZGUHA:great_bbq_tongs:mark_kosobiecki	I was a little reluctant to purchase these because I had heard a lot of things about the spring mechanism in them being faulty but that they were being recalled and fixed.  So I was wondering if the one I bought was a fixed model or not.  Well, it must have the newer design because I've been using these for a few months and I have nothing but good things to say about them.  I was previously using a long OXO set of tongs which were pretty good but a little flimsy for some of the heftier cuts of meat like, whole chickens and pork shoulders.  These tongs are sturdy!  You know that the minute you pick them up and feel the weight to them.  They can easily pick up anything you need on the grill and, because of the 20 inch length, you can keep you hand at a safe distance from the actual fire.  The handle has grooves for your fingers and thumbs which enhances the grip and they lock in a closed position for storage.	1
B00004U9VU:only_bad_thing_about_this_cooker_is_that:richard_langer	Weber discontinued it and Amazon no longer has it.  My pal has a condo with a balcony (not large) this is the Weber for her - equip it with ONE charcoal rail and you get lots of indirect heat for smoking.	1
B00004U9VU:hard_working_traveler:james	This is an excellent little grill for home or the road. The lid lock is a godsend and the side benefit is that due to the construction of the piece, smokey joe is an apt name. the carry handle is awesome. The side vents direct air such that I almost always have beautiful smoke filling my little grill and infusing my meal with fabulous flavor. I've had mine for over a decade and while I've gone through another big Weber kettle and now a huge smoker, this little number is still in the race and I have NO intentions of giving it up. I'm taking it camping with me next weekend. It's a no-brainer. Buy it and be happy	1
B0000CDD2U:very_easy_to_use,_great_features:steven_altschuler	Took it out of the box. 7 minutes later I was watching the weather, inside and out. Would recommend highly	1
B000BIXAQW:awesome_chairs_and_unbelievable_price:william_arth_"bills2dogs"	We love these chairs! We have been looking and didn't want to spend 1000 dollars just for one chair. We ended up buying 4 chairs and the sofa. The look great around our pool and all our friends rave, about them. We had seen some chairs from frontgate and these were just as good, but at a fraction of the cost.	1
B000BPQPXA:ugly_but_it_works:just_me	We bought this for an intelligent 95 year old woman who wanted lots of information at her finger tips. She knows immediately the date, time, day of the week and weather prediction. It is very ugly but does the job perfectly!!	1
B00004ZAVM:ideal_hummingbird_feeder!:dolores_j._canterbury_"dolly_canterbury"	This solved my problem of ants in the feeder... had it hanging on our deck all summer long, and they never got to it!  This feeder is also very easy to clean, and because it is made of glass does not pick of that aging, hazy appearance.  I highly recommend it to anyone	1
B000BQWTWU:great_product_-_does_it's_job_well:michael_t._mason	This durable grill mat does an excellent job.  The product's material absorbs grease without burning or warping.  In my opinion, what I like best about it is that it catches and holds the majority of solid particles which fall from the grill (which turn into hard-to-clean stains just as often as grease).  It is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product	1
B0001PG2RO:lacrosse_technology_wt-3181p_outdoor_atomic_wall_clock_with_temperature/humidity:rainer_mueller	This is the third of three of these clocks that I have purchased for our city council chambers.  At first I was somewhat leery that the location of our chambers would make it difficult for the clocks to automatically set themselves via the radio setting, but this turned out to be unwarranted.  As a result we have three clocks now that automatically keep perfect time, all synchronized, and all automatically adjusting for daylight savings time and standard time.  In the past, keeping three clocks in one room synchronized was impossible, and was made more difficult since these were 15 feet up on the wall.  The features of the temperature and humidity were an added bonus.  The price was about 25% as much as compared to other clocks our city was investigating.  In all, I am totally impressed with these clocks, their operation, and their pricing, so much so, that I bought two for my home and one for my travel trailer	1
B000JDQIY0:great_fun!!:new_reviewer	These herbs are too young to taste yet, but they are coming along!  I previously grew the salad greens, which thrived, but weren't as handy as having fresh herbs growing, especially when one considers the high prices of fresh herbs at the grocery store.  I am just trying to be patient and check out the growth on a daily basis	1
B000AYN7LU:a_breakfast/lunch/dinner_bucket_+_excercise:george_baughman_"kong_stuffer"	I have used medium sized Kongs as a	1
B000F2KTUO:value_for_money:tom_cook	Nice good looking grill, good price with free shipping.	1
B00004RALI:great_price:charles_f._tate	I shopped around localy and online to replace my worn out grates.	1
B000063085:good_deal_:william_doyle	I am impressed with this product. All the parts were clearly marked. All the parts were included in the box. The directions were excellent. No complaints here	1
B0006HRWS0:winter_warmth_and_a_cigar:john_e._chevalier	I bought this unit along with some adirondack chairs and a small table so that I may sit outside during the winter (not in severe weather) and smoke a cigar.  I must say besides being attractive and being easy to assemble that this fire pit allows anywhere from2 to 6 people to comfortably sit around it and stay warm.  I burn hard woods in it anywhere in the neighborhood of 2 - 4 hours and have not noticed any warping or buckling, the door is a little flexible but it is made of the same screen material as the rest of the unit and is holding up nicely.  It opens and closes easily.  If your wood has a propensity for popping I have noticed that the screen material could be considered a touch too large, but I don't think it is enough of a minus to give this fire pit any less of a ratin	1
B000BPQPXK:atomic_clock:valdemar_l._hallett_"clock_shop"	Oregon Scientific atomic projection clocks are great.  I have three of these closcks and am looking forwared to buying 2 more	1
B000BIXAQ2:great:p._fairer	The hose guides were exactly as pictured in the ad.  They are worth the price considering the cost of other hose guides I have researched on the internet.  I recommend them	1
B000CC5G3M:large_and_good_quality:ron_t_"ron"	Larger than I expected and thick/heavy.  Good quality and definately worth the price.	1
B00077AA7O:absolutely_stunning_clock!:c._larche	This is a beautiful time piece and looks better after it's hung on the wall. The fine woodwork and craftmanship that was put in to this clock makes this a fine addition to my home. The atomic function of the clock works just like it was designed. I put the battery in it and that's it. It took nearly six hours to adjust to the accurate time, but it's designed to receive the radio signal overnight or when you have the best reception  . I highly recommend this clock. It is more than I expected	1
B00005AH85:works_wonders:m._tindall_"akstu92"	I bought this for my husband in December, we put it in December 25 (we have an acre for our back yard) with about 40 mole holes....the ground has been freezing on and off, and we put one in the middle of an old "hole".... Takes 3 D batteries and believe it or not the thing is STILL vibrating (sounds kind of irritating if your close) but who cares....beats the back yard looking like a new cemetery. NO NEW HOLES...you could chew more "Juicy Fruit" which the kids love to help out with for our small front yard, but that only lasts you about 3 weeks....I"m buying another for the front yard	1
B000BIVK3C:pretty:b._garrison_"bkilburn"	This is beautiful birdbath.  If placed on solid ground (walkway, concrete) it will be great. However, if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom.  A wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip.  However, it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright.  I am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch	1
B0002OOMSA:pizza_on_the_grill:t._smith	This pizza cooker works really well.  I have a grill large enough to use 4 at a time.   A couple of hints for using the cooker ;turn pan 180 degrees ocationally for more even cooking and when dough is just starting to get firm, slide a non stick spatula under to lift dough out of the holes in the pan.	1
B0002OOMSA:smoky_flavored_pizzas_at_home!:james_o._reilly	The ZaGrill rocks.  I had issues at first because I trusted my grill's temperature gauge.  After I was given an in-the-grill thermometer and adjusted to the proper temperature, my wife and I could not be more happy with the results.  Grilled Pizza (and a glass of wine) all summer long and no mess	1
B000BIU1X2:they_just_came_today,_they_are_better_then_i_thought_they_would_be:l_from_nj	I paid $200 and free shipping for two chairs	1
B0000CBJGT:this_grill_is_fabulous!:r._prabhakara	I am no pro at grilling, but this grill makes it all so easy!  It was easy to put together, easy to use, and easy to clean up.  Everything I toss on it turns about perfectly grilled and absolutely yummy!  There are cheaper charcoal grills out there, but if you're a petite woman, like me, who doesn't grill for a living, it is well worth the extra money for the little conveniences of this grill.  I got the 18 1/2 inch grill, and it has plenty of room for preparing dinner for 4-6 adults.  Since putting my grill together, I have cooked out every weekend	1
B0009WG6RA:good_entry_level_smoker:gr8stogie	I picked up this smoker at Lowes for a lot less than Amazon.  I also bought an inexpensive cover with elastic that works just fine.  Overall this is a good smoker.  Assembly took a while since the handles didn't match up with the holes on the smoker body and lid so I had to hammer at the handles a bit to get them to fit.  Otherwise assembly was easy.	1
B000I2ON6W:works_great_no_issues_so_far!:kevin_eng_"stangdriver"	Bought this for my apartment. Have two remote sensors: one in the bedroom and one between a window and the outside screen for outside temps. Works flawless and gives the same temp outside as it shows up on the weather channel! Humidity reading is great too as its led me to buy a humidifier for the dry months. All in all a good product	1
b000biu1xc:very_good_buy:janice_jainnini	I thought the bench was a very good buy for the money.  It fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	1
B000AXSJJQ:great_for_stew:jerry_d._williams	I purchased one of these cookers at a grocery store for thankgiving.  I didn't find out that amazon carried this brand until I went to the manufarturers website looking for the 10.5 quart fish cooker.  I haven't deep fried a turkey and probably won't.  My main use will be cooking brunswick stew and chili in large quantities for freezing and cooking fish and chicken wings.  I'm considering getting a wok.	1
B00030DEZA:combine_to_make_necklaces_-_cheaper_than_oriental_trading!:kiwanissandy_"go_bucks!"	I purchased the 300 pack of glow bracelets for our high school group to use as a fundraiser (selling at football games).  It came out to about .06 cents per piece.  What several of the kids were then doing was combining 3 of them to make a glow necklace (there are little clear plastic connectors that come with them so you can do that). The combined price of .18 cents far beats the price you get glow necklaces for at Oriental Trading ($1.00 each).  And you can't really tell the difference between using 3 glow bracelets and 1 necklace.  Would recommend these for kids birthday parties, fundraiser, church parties, etc.	1
B000A2K0M6:cheap_and_it_works!!!:r._a._ruggeri_"lotstobuy"	Cheap and it works is really an understatement! Item is quality made. Just plug in and empty drawer every day or so. No bait or bags to buy. I ran this the last weeks of summer and could not believe the amount of dead Mosquitos in the drawer. I highly recommend this item.	1
B000EIW9GG:does_the_job_well,_but_overpriced:j._miller	The best sprouter I've found.  Does a great job of growing sprouts, but very overpriced for its cheap quailty and build.	1
B00008T95O:awesome:paganchick_"nikki"	This tiny alarm clock is really cool. You have to read the manual and adjust how big and bright you want the projection on the ceiling. You can also adjust how loud and different patterns you want the alarm sound. It tells the temperature also. I liked it so much I bought my Mom one	1
B000659KBO:almost_perfect:lael_e._rapier_"catroast"	I love how well it works. It heats up nicely, does its job, and I am satisfied. My only problem is the igniter. It stopped working and I replaced it. Even then, it still doesn't seem to engage when I press the button. I don't get it. I'm confused. Help a brotha out.	1
B000EEU04I:handy:toolbelt_gal_"toolbelt_diva"	This is just what you need for those hard to reach places. Today's houses are built with such high walls and windows that you need to have this in your home	1
B00004VWLO:most_comfortable_chair-__and_repairable_when_cords_break!:p._moosman_"docjmo"	We bought 2 of these chairs used at a garage sale, after longing for the full-priced versions at stores.  We love these chairs, but given they had had a lot of use before we bought them, one of the chairs broke recently b/c of the cords fraying over time.	1
B0006U2PHK:it's_a_bbq_too!:amazon.com_shopper	Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He says it's great for BBQing over oak wood.  I like the way the light shines thru the cut outs	1
B000BIU1XM:very_nice:stephanie_l._paxson_"garden_goddess"	I'm so excited to use this table. The weather has been rainy ever since I got it. It assembled beautifully. Comes w/ it's own little tool. It's a nice strong, sturdy table but it's not overly heavy. I was able to move all the pieces to the patio and assemble w/o any help. It's going to get a lot of use this summer	1
B00004RALM:replace_the_need_for_an_extra_hand.:d._w._smith	Short of having an extra limb the hinged grate allows for roasting/grilling with much less heat loss.  The extra control of the heat source allows for a better cooked product.  "This steak is b--tching", was a quote from the gameday crowd at Jack Kent Cook Stadium at fedex field in Maryland.  I will continue to "Pimp My Grill" with more accessories for next season	1
B00062WIUC:superb_dutch_oven,__great_price!:peter_a._lamb	This is a wonderful dutch oven...I hemed and hawed between the more pricey Lodge Logic (which my other cast iron pans are) and this Bayou Classis...Thrift won out, and I bought this one. I am not disappointed in any way.  It was easy to season, and makes an unbeatable pot roast	1
B00023CWP6:in_a_pinch,_can_be_used_for_other_similiar_grills.:luke	My grill isn't a Webber, but I was still able to get it installed by cutting the top of the metal covering the electrode to make room for the burners.	1
B00023CWP6:piece_of_cake!:	Very easy to remove old igniter and install this one on my Weber Spirit 500 grill.  Took about 5 minutes and started up on the first push of the button.  No more trying to light a match and stick it through the hole on a windy/cold day	1
B000BIU1XC:very_good_buy:janice_jainnini	I thought the bench was a very good buy for the money.  It fits perfectly on a small area of our deck	1
B00005CFGK:great_household_item:karen_v.	I bought this item after being bit in the face by a spider while I was sleeping.  It was not a pleasant experience!  We stirred them up after poking around in the attic during an afternoon.  I was finding the nasty buggers everywhere until I got this unit.	1
B000AF3Q8S:great_piece_of_equipment:h._f._van_hemmen	This was a present for my wife. I thought it was pretty cool for her to have the outside temperature and the time projected on the ceiling next to her bed, and for me to never have to reset the clock with daylight saving time.	1
B000IXM8KE:love_it:kar_cederwall	I bought this to fill with sands and candles for an indoor area. It creates a cozy and warm addition when we watch movies and sports. The cover is a nice protective from the kids touching the candles. The sand protectes the fire pit from getting to warm.	1
B000050APG:great_communication_after_i_sent_a_email.:gayla_tregre	I was very pleased that this seller emailed me right away when I sent him an email about my concerns that the product might not be exactly what I needed and wanted to cancel the order. He very quickly emailed me and assured me he would cancel and refund my credit card and I was impressed with this service. Gayla Tregr	1
B0000CAQ0R:great_alternative_to_buying_a_new_range:william_knutson	I have an electric range and a propane bar-b-q.	1
B0000A4XFF:american_woods_products_are_top_quality!:garden-nerd	My patio is filled with American Woods furniture. Last year, I bought four of these sturdy cedar chairs, as well as a matching table, chaise lounge, and serving cart.	1
B00004RAME:excelleent_product_and_fast_delivery:g._feldbauer	Item arrived very soon after ordering using the free shipping option.	1
B0009NBBJM:simply_adorable:amazon_shopper	I got my Chia Herb Garden about a month and a half ago and making them grow has been very easy and pleasant. They are still tiny but they are doing good. My advice is to follow the instructions carefully: frequent watering, trimming, full sun or artificial light as explained in the instructions and plant food. Not only they can be used in cooking, they are very decorative and cute	1
B00077AA5G:great_little_meter:warren_e._greenwald	VERY satisfied with the performance of this meter. Have been looking for a Relative Humidity meter for some time that was accurate and durable. The temperature is also included which is great. Price is VERY good for what you get !!	1
B000F4OFIY:weather_station:s._porter	Really like this weather station. It seems very accurate in temperature and humidity readings both indoor and outdoor. Finding the proper batteries for the outdoor unit was a hassel in this area. Shipping was fast and am very pleased.	1
B000BPQPWQ:clock_works:louis_m._sensel	Despite the fact that this clock hangs in my basement rec room in Cincinnati, it has had no problem receiving the time signal from Colorado. It should be noted, though, that, as the manual mentions, the proximity of a powered-up TV or computer monitor can interfere with reception of the signal.	1
B0007ZGUIO:great_grill_brush:h._e._connors	This is one of the best grill brushes I've ever used.  And I've used a lot of them	1
B00004RBEE:stainless_steel_grates_are_great:thomas_w._long_"tom"	What is bad to say about these great grates? Uniform heat, easier cleaning than the cheaper porcelain grates, and a great replacement/upgrade for my 4 year old Weber. With these and new flavorizer bars, I plan on many more years of use for this grill. My only wish is that they were a little cheaper on Amazon--price didn't beat local prices by much and only super saver shipping made it a deal	1
B00004RBEE:great_product_with_speedy_delivery:g._feldbauer	Receive the item very quickly eventhough I selected the free shipping method.	1
B00004VWLX:made_my_grill_new_again!:griller	After having my Silver B for 7 years, the origional porcelin bars were very rusty. My grill would flare up terribly. I thought it might be from the rust holding the drippings and grease and making the flares worse. I was right! These stainless units (the length is listed wrong here) are great! I just cooked brauts without a flare up! Price was great; thanks Amazon	1
B000FJA0HE:nice_product:l._jones	It is a great product for the price. The prep station has a good storage capacity and is easy to move around our deck because of the wheels. It was easy to put together too	1
B0009JXYOG:love_it:jennifer_m._hilton	We have had this for along time now.  It works great.  It hasn't rusted or needed parts or repairs.  If you are thinking about getting one but are concerned about the price . . . just buy this one the better product	1
B00005B9XT:sturdy_construction_and_support_a_lot_of_weight:herman	nice stand, paint has faded a bit after a year being stored outside exposed to the elements, but isn't peeling or exposing any metal.  There are 3 segments, they all fit together easily and are reinforced to prevent breakage or bending, but they're freely attached.  So if you need to move your hammock stand you'll need 2 people unless you push it, if you pull it, one of the angled arms will slide out of the horizontal bar.  You could probably fix this yourself by drilling a hole through the bottom (horizontal) bar and into one of the arms to screw in a bolt, but the steel is very thick, about 3/16&quot; or 1/4&quot; thick	1
B000BPQUV2:works_-_it's_a_clock:e_neel	The back panel broke when taking it out of package, that is the packaging though not the clock.  It is in working order and keeps one 'on time'	1
B000BPQUV2:does_it_really_do_that?:donald_r._greer_"parade_rest"	A local news station in our area aires a commentary piece that ask the question, "does it really do that?", as it relate to product advertisements.  A news team member goes out to investigate the product to determine whether or not it really does do what it's advertised to do. Then the reality of the item is disclosed durig the commentary.  Well, News Team...if you're listening...save your time and money, take it from me, the LaCross Atomic Clock really does do that..all that it's advertised to do...and more. Three things that I particularly enjoy; the fact that It automatically sets itself according to the time zone, the numbers...white...are boldly displayed and help you to accurately read the time from a distance, and that it's precise in maintaining the time.	1
B00023CWOC:weber_burners_replaced:lakeman_"lakeman"	Excellent service, ontime delivery, perfect match for my grill.  Thanks for the detailed descriptions and pictures of the products you sell.	1
B0001QIUFA:best_grill_cleaning_brush_i've_ever_had:mike_testa	Excellent quality, functional, and flexible. Extra long handle lets me reach across the heat without getting burned.  The rubber grip was a nice touch, and the replaceable brush heads are unique.  This comes with 3 brush heads, and after those are used up you can get them for under $2.00 each. This is a very solid, well-built tool that is built to last. I highly recommend this.	1
b000biu1x2:great_chairs:the_wises	These are just as good as I hoped. No self assembly required & very comfortable. Recommended	1
B000I1A71I:great_for_the_size_it_is,_but_not_meeting_my_needs...:joan_matts_"mauntie"	This is a great "little" lunch box and I stress the word LITTLE. The way the bag is made if you put a medium or large bowl in it, when you carry it by the handle, you are carrying the bowl on it's side, which is ok if you are sure you secured the lids, but then when you go around the corner fast and it falls off the seat you start to wonder, did i really close the lid on the bowl right? sorry, i got of track there. Anyway, I use this daily and it does keep things cold and has two outer pockets that are great for utensils, napkins, gum and small things. Also, I have been using for over 3 months and it is quite durable.	1
B00005A3L1:great_for_casual_metal_detecting.:wayne_kuban_"wayne_k."	As a low cost metal detector I give this thing five stars. I bought this Detector several months back and enjoy it's relative ease of use, and it DOES find what you are searching for (coins, rings, earings, necklaces, etc). The other reviews here pretty much wrap it up as a good (affordable!) unit, but I wanted to make a few comments from an amateur's point of view:	1
B00005A3L0:a_good_starter:alm78	I am satisfied with this item. I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and did not want to spend too much incase metal detecting was just a 'phase'! It is easy to use and beeps at the first sign of metal! We've mostly dug up ring pulls from cans and a few cents here and there. We've had no problems with it. He's used it a number of times and the batteries show no sign of running out yet.	1
B00005A3L0:metal_scrapping_son:knightnoise	The Bounty Hunter is an excellent value for the person who loves to scour about an area that was lush with people ie.(company picnic, family reunion).  The Hunter is easy to use and is lightweight. The instructions are clear and concise in describing the difference between a rusty nail and a piece of jewerly. This is my first Bounty Hunter, and I've already recommended it to my friends	1
B000LDIWJC:great_idea!:d._r._lindsay	I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  This product has plenty of room in it for the tree that I have.  Unfortunately, it has no structure to it so it's very flimsy and makes transporting the tree somewhat difficult.  The fact that you've made something that replaces the original product packaging is very helpful though.  I'll give you an A+ for the concept and a B for the product design	1
B00005NN99:excellent_but_not_water_proof:eric_tahje	The sensor works very well however, since it is an outdoor sensor, it should be waterproof. It is not. It must be placed where the rain will not fall on it	1
B00005A3L5:best_buy_yet!!_worth_every_cent_in_finding_hidden_treasures:lahudgins23_"lahudgins23"	We Love it! Best purchase I have made in a long time! At first I thought it was a little too much to spend on a metal detector...  This is in the middle range and very easy to use. I bought it as a family project, something we all could do. In the first 3 months of purchasing it we have found 3 diamond rings, 2 gold watches, a bracelet, gold necklace and several old and valuable coins that date back to as early as 1890. Also it's a great hobbie and money maker. Worth every cent!! Don't forget to get the headphones---a MUST!!! Get it for a Christmas 2004 gift, your gift will keep them busy and keep giving back all year long	1
B00005A3L3:a_great_detector_for_the_money!:readingcop	Bought this as an open box.  What a great detector for the money.  I had it out of the box and up and running in 5 mins.  Very easy setup!!  Took it to the back yard and found 3 pennies in the first 10 mins (one was a wheat penny).  The LCD correctly displayed them as a pennies.  As this was my first time detecting, the unit seems very easy to use.  An excellent choice for those wanting a feature filled detector at a bargin price	1
B000BIZEXO:purchased_entire_collection._wow!:b._anderson	Extremely pleased!  We received the entire Strathwood Bainbridge Collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product(s)!!  The patio furniture is both beautiful and solid. Hope it will last for many years.	1
B0000CDD3I:i_bought_three,_they_all_work_great!:brian_morris	This clock is very simple and clean.  I had no problem getting mine to work.  I had to leave it overnight to get the signal and they all set.  One has walls blocking the western direction, and it sometimes loses the signal, so I just leave it out overnight at a better location and put it back.	1
B00004ZAW1:hummingbird_food:katherine_m._brisby	This product is good food at good price.  The shipping package was poor - cardboard containers were dented and leaking	1
B00005NN9C:good,_not_great:e._pihl_"just_me"	Fairly accurate, but not precise.  Also, a replacement unit costs more than a completely new system.  Oregon Scientific has a very strange pricing model	1
B0000BXHL0:fast_turkey:bridgit_a._schutt	I did a lot of research and if you follow directions , it is safe and fun.	1
B00023CTFY:best_price_for_this_item:joseph_a._tominsky	This was the best price on the internet for this item.  It fit perfectly and solved the problem	1
b000bizexo:excellent_table:the_wises	Lovely. Fast shipping. No problems with fastenings or construction at all. Have ordered the bench & 4 chairs too & look forward to them all arriving & being together on the deck. 2 chairs have arrived so far & they are great. Table even comes with touch up paint	1
b000bizexo:purchased_entire_collection._wow!:b._anderson	Extremely pleased!  We received the entire Strathwood Bainbridge Collection within 2 weeks and the packing job alone seems to be worth the cost of the product(s)!!  The patio furniture is both beautiful and solid. Hope it will last for many years.	1
B00004ZB55:grandma's_view:	We received one of these chairs as a gift from our daughter several years ago.  It has been a great conversation piece, besides being a very comfortable chair.  The grandkids argue over who's turn it is to use it.  It is very relaxing to sit in it on the patio on a nice summer evening and read or watch the sunset	1
B000067DKA:seems_to_work,_but_there's_a_typo_somewhere!:mona_lisa	Ok, I just got one of these things, and I have to admit that last evening I stood by our seasonal stream watching the mosquitoes laying eggs on the water, and the mosquitoes weren't noticing me a bit.  I do have a big Lentek mosquito trap which has been helping quite a bit with the populations, but really, they should have been driving me nuts.	1
B00005B0BM:love_this_clock:tami_mccullough	I recently purchased this clock for our bedroom and it has been one of my favorites purchases. I can read the clock during the day and night with no problem and the atomic clock set up within 2 minutes, it was so easy. I also like having the temputure show up. I would recommend this to everyone looking for a projection clock.	1
B000BNP98E:good_price_,_good_watch:george_gulie_"george_g"	It's a good watch, i'm happy with it, it does the job	1
B0006G2WYU:great_product_at_a_cheap_price:dylan_knight_"dylan"	This does what you want it to. Accurately tells the temp indoor and outside and refreshes itself about every 30 seconds. What more could you ask for? Theres also a blue backlight so you can press any button during the nightime. It also functions as a clock with an Alarm but I dont use it.	1
B000HBVNH6:strathwood_2-seater_sofa:carolyn_"carolyn"	I am delighted with this product.  It is beautiful and reasonably priced	1
437	I just bought and installed this CD with the hopes of learning some Haitian Creole, and I, too, couldn't find it.  There is absolutely nothing on the installation CD that mentions either Haiti or creole... except the jewel case which insists it's there.  I'm so dissapointed I haven't actually tested anything else out:  I consider this a VERY bad start	0
22080	I installed a perfectly legal upgrade of Photoshop CS2.  It worked fine for a handful of months, and then it quit.  Technical support was of no help.  I had to reformat my hard drive and essentially rebuild my entire machine.  I am so frustrated about this.  I probably spent 100 hours with the data backup, moving data, reformatting, and reinstalling.  If I were a small business, I would be out of business.  All because this piece of crap program, which I purchased legally, decided to quit.  Totally unacceptable	0
60128	This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life.	0
62613	I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more	0
109454	This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money	0
112426	I purchased Partition Magic 8.0 based on my previous experience with Symantec virus protection and firewall products.	0
129653	I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0.  Performance is very poor, especially the organizer.  It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements.  Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable.  The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly	0
146010	The program works fine on Windows XP and is easy to use. It lets you print cards of many sizes. The big disappointment is in the number of cards that comes with the program. The back of the box claims &quot;4500+ Cards and Sentiments, Celebrate life's special moments with cards for all occasions&quot;. That's nice. The problem with that is that I counted the total number of cards that come with the program.  It only adds up to 1045! So where are the other 3450+ cards and sentiments? Are you supposed to design them yourself? I just don't know. And certainly &quot;cards for all occasions&quot; means just that, doesn't it?  Well there's lots of birthday cards and plenty of holiday cards but not one sympathy card of any kind. I guess you just need to buy those on your own	0
153218	Obviously bogus reviews.  Version 6 was slow as a dog, so any improvement will make this more interesting.  Of course rasing the price to $300 and $450 is less interesting.  What about those of us that upgraded to the slow dog 6 and unintalled it to return to v5?  how bout tossing us all a bone	0
159773	I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download.	0
175210	As is typical with software claiming to be "topo", it is not. Expecting that the buyer of topos will typically be someone looking for USGS quads this software is not as advertised.	0
175774	This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me	0
177595	First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility.	0
190355	I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software.	0
190361	Loaded it on my laptop. It says that a compatible device was not found.	0
197792	I am extremelly disappointed with Roxio, the makers of CD Creators; especailly Easy CD Creator 5.   I purchased Easy CD Creator 5, sometime back from an affiliate of Amazon.com.  It was dispatched promptly and in very good condition.  I installed it on my computer running Windows 98.   After some initial problmes it was running fine.	0
223946	Acrobat 5 was so buggy that I thought I'd give Adobe a couple of product cycles before upgrading. Should have waited longer. There have been improvements in v7: a better look, better commenting, the ability to add text that actually prints, and far better OCR functionality. But other basic functions are way worse than in v5: some Word documents that were easy to convert to pdf in v5 will not convert in v7, seems to be something to do with font license issues. Installation is a nightmare and repeated re-installation was required to get past system hangs, clashes with standard security software, and endless errors in the automatic update feature. The new product activation makes this even more of a pain because too many re-installations force you to activate by phone. Despite my already low expectations of Adobe, this product is a disappointment. With Acrobat 7, Adobe is, as usual, charging top $ for what any decent company would consider an embarrassing mess even as a beta version.	0
249396	Ok! Being the richest human being on the planet called earth, Bill Gates decided that he's not wealthy enough. So he released this Microsoft office 2003, which I really think is not much different from previous edition. The price is, as usual, very expensive. What's worse is that Bill Gates decided all the pre-installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version. So mere mortals like us need to spend extra BIG money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents.	0
249893	In the last year I have tried this program, PC-Cillin & four sharewares from CNET, and f-ZA the only one that doesn't cause more problems than it solves. The others prevent me from doing wireless printing, slowdown the computer & generate false alarms	0
249924	I used Version 8 and 9 and NEVER experienced a problem.  Version 10.latest version is terrible.  Crash and burn.  Don't take their advice and re-install your operating system.  Its THEIR software and not the OS.  Amazon and Pinnacle (Avid) continue to sell this product even though its terrible.  I read it was re-written for version 10 and they CAN'T get it right.  Nonetheless, they still charge full price and for support calls. The upgrade should have been free.	0
253912	i was charged the full price of 49.95 with no $20 coupon inserted	0
253919	I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work	0
278346	I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first few words I looked up in the thesaurus were not listed -- words like upholstery!  When I went online to see what I might be able to glean from their online site, first Fogware had not sent me a coupon, then I had to deal with bad customer service (I am not doing business with any companies anymore that give bad support) then after I finally got the coupon code they had left out of my box, the online info is exactly what we have in the cd -- so save your money and do not subscribe to their extended services site unless you need a spanish online dictionary also!  VERY BAD!  I am now going to go buy Roget's and check it out	0

288432	All I wanted was a way to identify some files, remember which ones so every time I wanted to backup, I would press "go" and the backup would start. AlohaBob was too "smart" for my use. First, it has this intelligent file finder that finds what is likely to be backed up.  I indicate that I want to select my own files (which it lets me think I can do). Then thinking it would bring me to browser window -- no, no, no...it still needs to waste time doing its indexing as if I had selected the "smart find". I then manually select my files (great!!). In trying to save the "template" of what files I wanted to backup, it requires that I make it a reoccurring backup with selected backup frequency (YUK!!). I want to back up when I get to it (about once a month, not when it wants to -- I am backing up to a DVD which I need to put in the drive).  OK, so now I am over that and the backup begins - GREAT!!!  Upon returning into the application a month later, I can not select my saved "template" to "run now", it will run when it is scheduled to run :(  So...I need to repeat the whole process just to get the same files as last time backed up.  I exchanged emails with the company and they understood but were not going to "add" the features I described.  Oh well - it looked like such a promising product.  Now I need to find another that satisfies my requirements	0
303664	This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children	0
313345	I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch.	0
317917	I have to qualify this review by saying that I do not own PM 8.0, so I cannot fairly give a rating, despite overwhelmingly negative reviews. I can only relate personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I do own and have used PM 6.0 since '01 when it was still Powerquest instead of Norton/Symantec and it has worked very well, though the GUI is a bit quirky. I have run it with 2 drives, one with 98SE and XP Pro, with PM loaded on 98SE partition and it did everything I needed on both drives. Trouble is, version 5.0 is, AFAIK, not compatible with XP and since M$ no longer supports 98SE, we have a problem, Houston. Currently I am  using a mobile drive bay to switch drives as needed. If I get a drive partitioning software product compatible with XP, it most assuredly WILL NOT BE ANYTHING PRODUCED BY NORTON/SYMANTEC, based on these reviews and personal experience with Norton/Symantec products. I first bought a computer in '98 and used Norton Antivirus 5.0. At that time, Norton was probably the best antivirus product out there. It worked flawlessly and I used and recommended it for years. NO MORE. I purchased a copy of Symantec System Works 2005 right after it was released. Long story short, I no longer use Norton products because I got tired of the system crashes and stability issues caused by the unstable bloatware and system resource hog that it has become, and am currently using a competing product that is very highly rated but is not common on the shelves of the big box stores. There is one lone Symantec product I still use---Windoctor, which is not installed on my 'puter but ran from the CD as needed.  Adios, anything else produced by Norton/Symantec. It ain't worth the headaches when there are much better products available for less coin.	0

387451	This product is very nice when it works.  However, I'm having the same problem as the reviewer below me.  When I attempt to export the image - either by saving, draging or copying, Hemera places a transparency over the object, making the product worthless.	0
401399	This is the worst version of Adobe Illustrator to be released since version 9. Opens files that I've been using for years and then writes scribbled, unopenable 'saved' versions. Crashes. Can't save for mysterious reasons. Writes "version 10" files with text split into pieces.	0

413050	This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me	0
415679	First of all, Microsoft needs to come down on their prices (Not that this will ever happen). I build computers for a living, and I'd say that 9 times out of 10 Windows is the single most expensive piece of any PC I build. That being said, XP has come a long way. Service pack 2 has done wonders for security. I also found it is the most stable version of Windows I've used to date. That's not to say it doesn't have it's flaws. It still lets in it's share of "germs", stops responding from time to time (hangs), and it's very slow to shut down. The built-in CD writing software is TERRIBLE and Remote Desktop is not always a pleasure to use either. However, the biggest problem I've had so far is with product activation. As a PC technician, I'm always testing new parts. The most annoying problem I've had is that after you make a certain number of hardware changes (let's say you replace a video card, a hard drive and add some memory) all within a certain period of time (180 days maybe?) Windows makes you reactivate. This becomes a problem when you have to reactivate twice within this period of time. It makes you call Microsoft, where you have to convince the representitive that you're not trying to steal from them. Then you have to read them a long number (I think 41 digits) and then they'll read another long number back to you that you need to type in. It's driven me to the point of using Windows 2000 again to test my parts, even though this isn't always practical for testing XP compatibility.	0
435359	The title of this product is a joke.  It should be called "Not Easy CD burning".  Roxio version 5 was much easier than this one is.  It is way too complicated for burning simple CDs	0
435365	This Roxio software has caused me the most bizarre and frustrating experience ever.  First, it doesn't work.  Second, I cannot obtain any support from Roxio to find out why.  They won't give support until you register, the only way to register is to follow a web link that comes with the software, and it takes you to a website that either doesn't exist, or is always down.  Thus, it turns out to be a complete waste of money, not to mention several hours of time.  RUN, don't WALK away from this software and this company	0
438010	I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!	0
446386	I spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product. Although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an "update" that when run, errored out as soon as it began	0
458748	I found this title messing around adding things to my wish list.  I only read the blurb on Amazon enough to see Haitian Creaole listed as one of the languages.  Today updating my wish list I took extra time to find out why this was rated so low since nearly every thing on my list is 4 stars or more!  How unfortunate to find out that others before me made the mistake I almost made buying this in hopes of it having Haitian Creole!  Very disappointing!!!!  The makers should be ashamed	0
499114	If I had $1 for every time a CS2 app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work, I'd have about $10. And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future. In any event, do not buy the CS2 apps, Adobe does not deserve your support	0

531142	I have owned eleven VCOM products and from now on, they don't have my business. The product touts itself in part as a vital tool when/if your machine crashes. If it does, be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program. You are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can't run it-although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process. Sadly, customer assistance is no help-emails are unanswered and you can't get through via phone...What you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products. Thanks, folks. Version 6.0 is also much slower than Version 5. Support for 5.0, by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out, despite the functionality of that program.   For the price, the software should work like a major player, rather than a dollar bin special.	0
531149	After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.	0

577437	I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.	0

B000GP1666:a_few_bewares:anthony_brady	I bought the software ( Digital Image Suite 2006 ) before I bought my camera - to be ready to process the pictures I was going to take.	0
B000HLT4Y0:of_no_use_to_me:roderick_barnes	I wanted to use this product to tape sporting events, as part of a promotions unit I belong to. I had used Videowave 7 which was OK and produced a more than adequate product, but would on occassion crash to the extent I would have to reload the software. I thought I would give PE 3.0 ago, since Adobe products generally have a good reputation.	0
B0000AZJVB:stop!__seriously_consider_star_office_8_instead!:sam_i_am	Before you donate your hard-earned money yet again to Bill Gates' 'Feed the Multi-Billionaire Fund', do yourself and the world a favor and search for 'Star Office 8' on Amazon and read the reviews there.  I use MS Office Professional 2003 in the office, and just cannot believe how badly so many businesses and individuals are being ripped off by Microsoft for this BLOAT-ware.	0
B000KLNQW8:annoying_to_use:j._dahl	Systemworks continues to grow, taking ore hard drive space and messing with more stuff on your computer, and I'm likely to buy an alternative next time I update.  Note it stops working entirely if you install upgrades to your computer - a new hard drive, motherboard, or processor and Symantec requires you to spend a fortune on another copy.  I like the basic functions, but there's too much baggage to recommend this product anymore	0
B000IAOIXW:worthless_product_with_horrible_customer_service:l._mcmahon	Used Norton antivirus the last 3 years. getting product in tax software promotions.  No problems until I installed 2007 6 days ago, when my system became really slow and then I was unable to access the internet.  Since their customer service phone number is not in the User Guide but buried in their website, I was thankful my husband's laptop was available. The first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions did not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours and tersely told me he was sending me an email file that would solve my problems.  I had identified it was the Worm Protection causing the problem so I turned that off, accessed the file and ran it.  My computer updated twice with no change - if the Worm Protection was on, I wasn't going to be able to access the internet.	0
B000096L72:poor_on_the_most_basic_level:s._keenan_"skeenan"	This software does not provide even the basic red eye fix.  It turns them a light shade of grey, maybe. It is horrible.  This to me renders it useless.	0
B000JD3AIW:it_goes_downhill_faster_each_year:l._hoffman	After using this product for Mac for over 10 years.  I'm done.  The price keeps going up, the "tax-help" within in the program keeps diminishing and the customer service is almost non-existent.	0
B000JD3AIW:would_have_been_nice_to_know_its_not_98_compatible!!:a._catapano	I have used Turbo Tax for the past 3 years so this year like a drone I purchased it at Amazon. Great price by the way. Well I receive the product and try to load it and find out as of July '06 it isn't compatible with windows '98. Now I have to send it to Turbo Tax for a refund. Its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box. After a 45 minute call to Turbo Tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of $20 for the purchase of their online software. The online software was the same exact program I purchased from Amazon but they charge $20 more...go figure. It sounds fishy and deceitful to me. I will never buy their software again!	0
B000AMPJPY:buggy_software:bob_christner	Omnipage is a buggy piece of software which is prone to throwing errors and mysterious crashes (often occuring at the end of a lengthy process).  Nuance provides no support and when you attempt to contact them they want $9.95 for an email question or $19.95 for a phone question.  You might expect this from an inexpensive piece of software but for the cost of Omnipage you would expect some support.  I recommend finding something more reliable from a company that provides some measure of support	0
B00022PTRU:not_bad_for_microsoft:steve-o	Other than the substandard security; the endless hours you will spend trying to clean out spyware, protecting against viruses, etc.; and the fact that Microsoft has built in it's own spyware to notify them when you are connected to the internet, it's pretty good. It is a good evolution of their graphical interface and quite intuitive.	0
B000HLV59W:not_the_best:jacataqua	I bought Adobe Elements 5.0 because I thought it had more features than Microsoft Digital Image Suite, and it probably does. Getting the Adobe software to work is the trick. I even bought two books to help me learn how to use Adobe and I still can't get it to work right. I should have stuck with Microsoft, it is much easier to use.	0
B0007GCY38:too_complex_for_"express":robert_cozzi	Isn't this a Mac product? I thought Mac products were supposed to be (A) stable, and (B) easy to use.  This product is stable, (once I upped my RAM to 2GB) but at 512MB it brought the system to a crawl.	0

B000IAMRU8:incompatible:richard_v._abbott	There is no excuse for Norton not advising of the incompatibility of this antivirus software with popular firewalls such as ZoneAlarm before installing the software, especially since previous versions have been compatible.

B00062AJOO:greedy:c._b._turner_"carol307"	I have never ever used an application that was totally designed to get more and more money.  Every other page is a sales page and after paying $300 plus for the application and another $200 for the payroll, now I have to pay if I want their help.  It is a good tool but the company mission is to make more money, no longer has anything to do with their customers.	0
B000I4RMFE:i_want_to_go_back_to_ultra_6!!!!:anthony_campana	What a terrible upgrade.  I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 6.  Even though I specifically told it to leave my file associations alone, it changed every one of them.  It's a nightmare.  I'm still trying to get Nero disassociated with certain file types, to no avail.  The backup program is awful, slow and much more difficult to use than the one built into 6.  Overall, Ultra 6 is a much better product.  I'm going to uninstall 7 and send it back to Nero with instructions on where they can associate it	0
B0002VRPDC:no_zonealarm_support_unless_you_buy_from_zonealarm:t._bolly	Great software! Until You have a question or a problem that is. Then You get the run around BIG TIME! ZoneAlarm says they didn't sell it to me so they can't help me. They send me to Broderbund for help. Broderbund then sends me to Encore for help and they won't help me either. ZoneAlarm states if I didn't buy it right from ZoneAlarm then they don't give any support.	0

B000077DD3:learning_german_at_48_years_of_age:robert_a._seidel_"jaginblue"	Generally like the program. Hoped it came with a CD to practice in the car but was wrong. It is totally PC based. I'll let you know in about three months if I can actually conduct business in Deutsch.	0
B000HCVR3K:ms_send_me_some_relief_money!:j._waltman_"shop-on-line_maven"	Being a PC user for many years (since 1985)I have come through all the versions of MS operating systems (does anyone out there remember 3.5!) MS has also piggy backed this "robust" office product for 20 years.  Their upgrades are seldom anything more than a better looking toolbar.  This is no exception, but this time I like the tool bar!  As to ease of use, I use PowerPoint and Word often and my spouse uses Excel.  If there were an easier product available we would buy it but then Windows XP would kill it on sight and Vista would stop working altogether.  Why does MS think that everyone but those working in a professional since (hence Office for Professionals) needs all the junk they subject us to?  Do those guys in Redmond still think adult users of the PC like "cute" things like little doggies wagging their tail or a friendly paper clip to help you answer your every question!  I am tired of Beta testing MS products for so many years but as a PC user I am stuck with them and until someone else can come up with a better system, other than Mac, we are all stuck with them.	0
B000IALMMC:disappointing_to_say_the_least:m._burge_"digital_photog"	I did a little research after trying to install this product and found that Symantec is no longer rated very well for Anti Virus.  One site that states this is Consumer Reports (they are towards the bottom of the ratings).  It has become major bloatware and its stability isn't what it used to be.  Maybe this is why Peter Norton sold his interests and bailed out.  I am far from being a novice, but this thing gave me a fight the whole way.  So on with my saga.	0
B000B8P8VM:very_comprehensive,_and_very_cumbersome:jonathan_austin_"jsa336"	I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam	0
B000BAWLS8:system_worthless_is_more_like_it:jason_a._nowak_"jaylovespunkrock"	I can't even comment on the actual System Works application because I never got it to run - it ruined my system right after install!

B000HCTYTO:prepare_for_severe_speed_reduction_and_constant_problems:levi_j._page	Microsoft continues their legacy of software that doesn't work. I've been using Windows since the very beginning and 2000 professional and windows xp was about the only solid operating systems Microsoft has released. You would expect this so called upgrade to further improve upon this, instead it is many steps backwards. BTW, I have a 4400 AMD, 3 gigs of ram, and can say that Vista is SLOW SLOW SLOW. Be prepared for everything to run slower than it did on XP. Cool interface, about the only positive thing about Vista I have found so far. Searches are also much faster, but hardly a reason to upgrade. Be prepared for Windows Updates after installing Vista that actually cause once working drivers to stop working. I'm tempted to go back to XP, so needless to say a big waste of time and effort.	0

First it took almost 2 hours to install at the last 3% it found a error and was going to roll back.  Well it never did.  It erased everything.  It went to a dos prompt. Called help line and it took 3 hours to just reload.  When it was done, I had no files or any of my programs on the hard drive.  Not only that but he said I had to install again to register.  It takes forever to install.  Took forever to get in touch with someone, they were in Nova Scotia, and I still do not have a working computer.

B000K2PA3A:mac_users_beware:dogfather	The system requirements for this product on their packaging says nothing about Mac support and requires Windows.  H&R Block didn't support Mac's last year and they've only given half-hearted support this year.  If you own a Mac then TurboTax is your best bet.	0
B000068CO7:big_glitch_in_software:s._teetz_"photo"	This software messed up my computer big time.  It does something first of all, to Microsoft word.  Word does not work properly after installation of Photo Explosion.  It then went into different areas of my computer and screwed it up.  At first I only suspected it to be Photo Explosion.  I had to have my computer sent back to HP.  When I got it back I reinstalled Photo Explosion and the same thing happenend.  BE CAREFUL.  Product has BIG PROBLEMS - WHICH WILL GIVE YOU BIGGER PROBLEMS - I GUARANTEE IT.	0

B000CE9IAM:horrible_product_this_year:susan	I used TurboTax Premier last year & was so happy with it that I told everyone to buy it this year.  What a fool I was.  This years program was a nightmare.  I will never purchase it again.  Every time I needed to go back to check something, I had to go backwards through each page until I reached the page I wanted.  Then to go forward to where you originally were, you had to retrace all your steps a second or third or fourth time.  It got to the point I quit going back to check.  It took hours this year and I am still not confident the results were correct.  I may take it to H&R Block just to see if I need to file an amend.  Next year I will try a different product.  ---One other thing, navigating the State portion was so difficult.  There were hidden pages in something called "quick zoom" or some such thing.  I could never figure out where I was.  Thanks for the headache Turbotax	0

B0001F0XHE:unsatisfied_customer_-_version_5.0.5:rusty_westburger	I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean	0
B0001F0XHE:warning!___so_so_software-_bad_company_!!:d._l._fleming	I have owned Spysweeper for several years. I have found that a large amount of spyware is not getting caught.

If your needs are really so simple that this product will work for you then you would be just as well off using a spreadsheet, or downloading the free version from Microsoft, or even using their home version with business added.  By the time you figure out that you need better capabilities it will be too late to return it.	0

I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games	0

B000HLT5HQ:stay_away_from_this_company...:librarypiper	The new product release is worthless - too buggy and slow to work.  The previous releases were ok - they did find some malware and removed it, without interference in our system.  However, despite the cute-sy interface, there are other software programs that provide the same (or better) anti-malware support.	0
B000JLSQLK:still_waiting_for_a_fix....:anonymous_"card_maker"	I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea.....	0
B000HE39MK:worst_software_made:k._kirwan	This software will not load properly no matter how you try. The online help is no help at all it gives you a few suggestions that all boil down to please try to re-install. Their down loadable wizard informed me after using it that I needed buy the components that didn't load but were on the disk. Try and remove the parts that do actually load and they do not uninstall properly. McAfee has a section devoted to removal of their software but so far all the suggestions have not worked. Need customer service and its $2.99 per minute from you're first call. I have never had such a horrid experience with a software from a "reputable" company in a long time. I will never buy McAfee products again.	0
B000HE39MK:won't_co-exist_with_other_programs:dave_"dave"	Until '07, if you had a McAfee suite but only wanted to use some of its components, and use other programs for other aspects of protection, that worked fine. For instance, I use Zone Alarm Pro for firewall and Spyware Doctor for spyware, and McAfee '06 just for virus. This combination has worked fine, but McAfee '07 won't install *any* of itself unless all other programs are removed. And that's a no-go for me, since some components of McAfee (esp spyware) weren't rated all that well by reviewers.	0
B000H28RZG:don't_use_with_ms_office_2007:j._d._ray	I recently upgraded to MS VISTA and MS Office 2007 and I upgraded to the VISTA version of PDF Converter Pro 4.  BIG, BIG MISTAKE!!  The program installed some sort of pdf "add-in" to MS Office that caused Excel, Word, and Outlook to CRASH.  As soon as you opened one of the programs it would give an error message and close.  It took hours on the phone with Microsoft to figure out and correct the problem (THANKS MICROSOFT!).  However, I got ZERO help from Nuance, they wanted to charge me to even REPORT a problem!  BEAWARE YOU WILL NOT GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT WITH NUANCE PRODUCTS! Before I upgraded, I used PDF Converter Pro at home whereas at work I used Adobe Pro.  There is no comparison, PDF Converter Pro while considerably cheaper, does not do near as good a job of producing pdf files. I'm still looking for something that works but is cheaper than Adobe.	0
B0009QUV72:not_installable:a._izzo	Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).	0
B000K2P9HM:beware_and_double_check_your_results!!!_-_this_product_could_cost_you_much_more_than_$25!!!:ts_"ts"	This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again	0

B000GHV6N2:pos:pen	This is the first review I have written in probably a few years.  Normally, I don't feel strongly enough about any product, good or bad, to bother entering a review.  With this new version of Quicken, I have something that I feel strongly enough to write about.	0

B0001BG1NI:doesn't_work_with_widescreen_video:r._scigaj_"r"	Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD.  Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9.  This sucks.  I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9.  Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time.  Even in the new 7.5 version.  Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen	0

After reading hyped-up product features of version 11 from Nuance website, I cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to PRO given its  current cost. I am pretty sure that a lot more people (especially loyal users like me) would snap it up if it was little cheaper. I will probably wait for some time for price to go down.... It will also need time to stabilize ( no patches yet !!!) and become compatible with Vista. For those of you who got lotsa money (please send me some), I would recommend Paperport as a decent doc managment s/w	0

B000HKPD5K:the_worst_-_do_not_buy_this_product!!!:mjs_"mjs"	The most recent version 7.0 was sent via a downloaded upgrade to owners of this ZoneAlarm Internet Suit a couple of weeks ago and has been a nightmare.  The ZoneAlarm forums are filled with user's complaints.  This software is full of bugs, it has crashed user's OUTLOOK and OUTLOOK EXPRESS email programs, and we are unable to use our email.  ZoneAlarm customer service is the worst!  It took them 6 days to respond to my technical request email, and the response was canned and not appropriate to the problem.  I finally called their corporate office and was told "if you don't like the program uninstall it!".  If your want to speak to their technical support they charge $2.99 per minute, even if the problem was caused by them!  At this time the software remains not fully use-able, I have no email from OUTLOOK, ZoneAlarm has not owned up to the nightmare they have created with their users, and they are not responsive as to when a fix will be available.

B000HCZ9AC:vista_upgrade_will_cost_you_a_ton_of_money.__need_to_wait.:l._hansen	I bought the vista upgrade with my dell computer.  I tried to install and half way through the set up, after it had uninstalled my old programs, I got a message to abort.  The abort left me with a damaged media program, and thus far I have spent over $400 trying to re-connect damaged files and programs.  My best advice is to wait until Microsoft gets the "kinks" out of the vista program and then buy the upgrade	0
B000HE3466:save_your_money_and_your_sanity:larry	I have used McAfee for at least 5 years. This 2007 Suite is a piece of trash. I takes soooooo long to find a site that IF it eventually finds it you forget what you were looking for.  At half the sites, if they are found, it will not allow me to progress into the site. In setting it up it insisted upon registering but never did tell me if the registration was completed; just kept blinking. I assume it was registered because it did update. I cannot get into half the sites I visit on a regular basis. It won't even find the McAfee site. Just sits there searching until it gives me a notice it can't find the site. Never will I buy another piece of software from McAfee. I should have read the reviews before I bought it but I had been satisfed with the previous version so I never bothered reading them. Dumb move on my part. Dumb one on yours if you buy it. Never again.	0
B000HE3466:their_customer_service_stinks:kc_"cranky_pants"	I didn't use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world. The problem I had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it. I had a 2-year subscription and they send me an e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that I was in auto enrollment! When I called to complain they of course had someone who couldn't inderstand me and I had to spell my e-mail address THREE times and was told it would take 3-5 days for the refund to be processed which is crap because I work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day! I asked for a manager TWICE, the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine, and was put on the never-ending hold until I gave up 37 minutes later which was probably the plan all along. SO I called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment. Now I am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes	0
B000E8JLAI:garbage._don't_buy_it:d._brown_"software_developer"	I agree with the other reviews this is a horrible piece of software. I am a software developer and have written some serious applications in my career, and this one ranks at the bottom of the barrel.	0
B000B8K7WM:not_user_friendly:mr._small_business_"mr._small_business"	This program is terrible to deal with.  I run a small business and bought QuickBooks Simple Start.  Once loaded and you go to use the program there is a pop up requiring you have an Administrator.  When loading the software it does not tell you to select or bypass the Administrator requirement.  You only learn this when you first go to use the program. The URL they give on the pop up for troubleshooting does not address this issue, either.  You are just locked out of the program.  Now it gets fun. So, you have to speak to them for help.  But this is where it gets to be no laughing matter.  To get help you have to email them to ask for help.  They then call you back at their convenience.  If you are busy working when they call back you have to start all over.  I have yet to be able to use this product since I bought it 3 weeks ago because they will not call back when it is convenient for me the customer and will not let me call in at my covenience.  Even worse, since they have bought out all their competitors QuickBooks customer support no longer is available after regular hours when a small business owner has the time to handle such operations issues.  I can't return this product for a refund because I have loaded it.  My first clue to how not user friendly this product is should have been the title: Simple Start	0
B000HKN4W4:too_complicated:daniel_e._suman	The idea of being notified of every possibly suspicious action sounds good, but in practice ZoneAlarm is too intrusive for most home computer users. It seems to have bugs too, starting with an installation that initially wouldn't work on one of the computers on my home LAN. ZoneAlarm also seems to forget some actions that are allowed and supposedly remembered. I haven't gotten exasperated enough to buy another antivirus product and uninstall ZoneAlarm yet, but I'm close	0
B000EGIDPY:less_is_not_more.:cheryl_a._"cherylannh"	I've used Printmaster 12 platinum on DVD and liked it well enough but the disk wore out.  I knew from reviews of subsequent versions that Broderbund was giving us less and less but even still I was stunned by just how much less.  Where are all the projects?  Even counting the online projects there just isn't much here for anyone.  For kid's masks, version 12 has at least a dozen but this version gives you 2!  The cards are terrible - many are just small clipart images with a white background.  (At least you won't need much ink).  In short, if you want to create anything decent you'll have to design it yourself.  Inspired by the ONE nice-looking cut-out card, I was able to search the art work and create several nice cards that I would be pleased to send.	0

B0000BX73E:don't_do_it!_(unless_you_have_to,_of_course):leslie_k._thompson	This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either.	0
B000077DCZ:beginners_--_forget_about_it:john	If you do not have a mediocre-level understanding of Chinese, stay away from this product.  Rosetta Stone has a very unique approach that might work for children under the age of seven (the critical language learning years), but for every other beginner in the language the software is almost impossible to use.  The object of the "game" is to match a Mandarin phrase (said aloud and written in pinyin) to a poor, pixellated photo.  For example, in the first section of the first lesson, you are shown a ball, an airplane, an elephant and a horse.  A phrase will be read and you have to match it with the correct photo.  It gets much too complicated after that.  Basically, it's a pure guessing game for most of the time.  I gave this product a serious evaluation even after reading the plethora of poor reviews.  I thought the unique style was interesting enough to give a chance, but I feel as though I wasted hours and hours.  I can remember only two or three words from the entire experience.  Although I have spent fewer hours on Pimsleur's Mandarin audio lessons, I am able to recall many, many more words and phrases.  Although Pimsleur's isn't perfect, it's definitely the best choice for a beginner (along with a solid Chinese-English dictionary).	0

Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance.

B000GI0HQ8:advertising:c._hair_"it_pro"	Quicken software continues to contain prominent advertising for Intuit products and services.  In my opinion, it is fine to offer additional services to customers, but give the customer the opportunity to say "no thanks" and then leave them alone so they can be productive with the software.  Forever pestering a paid customer with advertising for the same products and services is not a good idea.

B000CC09UW:$25_worth_of_features_in_a_$270_box:todd_scott	We purchased this software to map retail locations on a region.  It is missing too many features to be usable.  For instance, when you import a custom graphic pushpin, the software doesn't resize it as you zoom which forces you to create multiple sizes in another program.  You can add text description boxes but have no control over the font or sizing -- and they don't resize either.	0

B000KLNQVY:nothing_like_it_used_to_be_....:donald_clarke	I have used System Works on my computer since 2000. The 2007 version is nowhere as good as the older ones. They have deleted many of the "real" diagnostic features (Registry Optomizer), dummed down the rest, and added (rather forced) an auto-load Norton Protection Center that takes over the Windows Security Center and cannot be easily unloaded. Software should be made to be user-friendly ... this version is nothing like the previous ones	0
B0002IP4LU:software_never_worked_properly!:mary_jo_williams_"jojo"	I have been unable to get the software to work on my Dell computer with WINDOWS XP.  Although I have been in contact with the technical team at SBT on many occasions, my initial problem has never been resolved.  I am unable to use the Test & Improve Your Memory software	0
B000BM8JW8:doesn't_import_financial_institution_data:d._sponseller_"radar_guy"	I just purchased the software and successfully installed it on my computer.  When I got to the point of entering dividends and capital gains, I couldn't figure out how to import the data from Fidelity that I've done for the last few years.  Looking around on the Fidelity website, I can across the following statement: "For the 2005 tax year, Fidelity information will not be able to be imported directly into H&R Block's TaxCut programs. H&R Block expects that these products will have this functionality restored for the 2006 tax year."  Unfortunately, this is the reason I'm using a software tax prep program, looks like it's back to TurboTax	0
B000HCTYSA:worst_os_from_microsoft_yet!:j._kowalski	I was a private beta tester for the new OS. I tested the software for a whole year and I am not pleased with it.	0
B000GD5DS0:trash!:craig_s._maupin_"corvine7"	I have been using this program for five years now and I'm finally going to switch to Quicken. The 'Invoice Designer' is a total waste of time... it just hasn't worked for years and Microsoft will do NOTHING to get it to work. This is the unwanted step child of Microsoft, so please don't waist your time	0
B00005RG2Y:horrible_product:capt_dials_"boatpoker"	I am really thinking of returning it to Amazon. I think I will stick with good-'ol MS Word. You see I wanted a 12-page form and spent two days creating it. It's a form to survey boats so it also had graphic areas for photos (about 12). Well, all seemed fine until you printed a filled form to .pdf. The size of the created .pdf was near 10MB! (Similary done with MS word resulted in a 1.2MB finished .pdf). Well, I can't be e-mailing 10MB files!	0
B000I2Y0CE:norton_lemon:steve_w._illig	I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it.	0
B000I2Y0CE:everything_that's_been_said_is_true:l._holmes	This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess	0
B0009JQRW2:good_but_a_fatal_flaw_:bookwatcher	Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.	0
B0009JKGRY:not_worth_it,_even_after_rebates:brittany	I installed this software after getting it free after rebates, and I must say I am not the least bit impressed. It claims to speed up your system, but instead only slows it down. Seems like it would be because it was bugging down my computer, but it's relatively new and has a gig of memory. As another reviewer mentioned, my internet stopped working correctly (although the other computers on my network without this program worked just fine with internet!) and my system restore just wouldn't work. It deleted a lot of entries I needed to run my system correctly.	0
B000HCTYTE:come_on?!,_vista_is_just_a_cheap_copy_of_other_operating_systems_!!!:pedro_arrioja_"resistance_is_futile"	Come one people, Windows Vista is not only as unstable as it's Windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management; I've lost lots of very important files due to Windows "errors" that shut down applications and even the PC itself, so i decided my self: TO USE LINUX OR TO DIE WITH MICROSOFT !, and i'm still alive ! ;-)	0
B000HCXKLC:outlook_2007_stopped_running_after_automated_update:e._castedo_ellerman	For those considering Outlook 2007, beware of my experience: one morning I ran Outlook 2007 to find it would not download email messages at all. (I would get an error about MAPI.) This appears to be due to an automatic office update of the junk mail filter.	0

B00005MOTF:microcrap:a._biermans	I have used DOS, Win3.1, Win95, Win98 and now this piece of crap OS. Microsoft's only interest is making money, thats why they come out with a new release of an OS upon a new release of an OS. Each one just as buggy, insecure and unstable as the previous version.	0

B000HLRAJG:the_most_unreputable_comppany!!!!:barbara_j._zaretsky_"shafted_customer"	iF i COULD, i WOULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS.Caveat emptor! Let the buyer beware. I made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of Feb. 2007. I had to open the box to realize I needed to load it as administrator. That was beyond my limited knowledge. Since it was opened I stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization. It took forever and many calls. They kept on lying on when the refund was mailed. Yes, this went into April 2007!!!!! They insisted the mailing date was April 9th. On the 18th I thought I'd never get it. They stopped payment and maybe issued another. Well, I received the $199 (I am shafted on my state sales tax.) But because those idiots didn't put the name of my street, it apprently was returned and what I got was postmarked April 16th!!!!! And they refuse to rescind the stoppayment. Sooooo...I now need to pray I will ever receive the replacement. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't beleive these people sell accounting and contact software	0
B000HLRAJG:act_on_a_fast_system:r._m._mayhew	I just purchased the top end Dell Dimension XPS (with the 10,000 RPM harddrive) but I still have to allow about 10 seconds for the initial program startup, then it seems to hang for 15 to 20 seconds after that. I usually just go get a cup of coffee when I start ACT and when I come back we are ready to roll.	0

B00030096W:forget_it.:simon_haynes_"hal_spacejock"	I will never buy another product from this manufacturer. I have a legal copy of this program, and on the weekend my motherboard died. I had to buy a new board then reinstall all my software, and when I got to DNS8 it told me I'd registered too many times and I had to buy a new copy.	0
B000B8K7SG:10_+_year_user:found_the_truth	I have used Turbo Tax for as long as I can remember.  I have always purchased their business and their personal tax products.  Generally I had been satisfied. However this year after spending much time over many months working on a complicated return, Turbo tax dumped all the data including that which was saved many times over several months. It corrupted all but 2kb of data and can't even open that. Of course you can't get a person via telephone or email.	0
B000B8K7SG:will_not_import_data_from_tax_cut:scout	Since Tax Cut decided not to produce a Mac version this year, I got stuck with Turbo Tax.  Their website promises that one may import data from the previous year's Tax Cut return.  Then you buy the thing, and you find out that it requires you to load the Turbo Tax program and your 2004 Tax Cut data onto a Windows machine, transfer there, then load it back onto the Mac for this to work.  So, like a chump I borrowed a friend's windows machine and did all this.  But, it doesn't work.  Not at all.  And it takes a lot of time to find that out.  Tried every workaround I could think of.  Nope.  It doesn't work.	0
B000AR0LLG:this_is_not_good:j._morehouse	I've used Omnipage 12 and 14 and got the latest version to convert an out of print book to a text pdf.  Nothing really fancy, two column text mostly w pictures and captions plus 3 tables. Using this software was a nightmare.  The OCR worked better than the previous version BUT it showed mixed fonts on the page (two column text w a title about 1/3 down and above the text).  No problem I thought, I'll just use the wysiwyg (what you see if what you get) text editor to fix this..it looks very nice w some good features.  Well, wysiyg is more like wysiwyDON'Tget.  I'd fix the fonts, save the file, open it in adobe reader and find that Omnipage had made some startling changes in the fonts/size and the titles.  I tried for 3 hrs to get a simple table of contents page w just a title and 8 lines (each w text followed by a page number)...no go.  Plus the wysiwyg editor would sometimes inexplicably throw me into 'replace text' mode while I was trying to insert text and I couldn't get out.	0
B0000AZK0Z:don't_install_if_you_have_2_different_handhelds:a._kummer_"accountant_mommy_of_2"	I bought this to protect my new Dell Axim, a replacement for my Palm Tungsten E (and a step up).  The Axim is wireless enabled so I wanted to protect it.  When I tried to install it, I ran into major issues.  It automatically wanted to install to the Palm (seeing the Palm Desktop software).  There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install.  I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email.  Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software.  How stupid!  I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet.  Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke.  I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact.  I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste!  Maybe it works great, but the complications of trying to install prevented me from ever finding out.  Amazon was terrific and let me return the product	0
B000GKCHYG:corel_--_poor_software_for_slideshows:n._cancellare	This software is fine for altering digital pictures if you do not have any other programs, but if you want to make exciting slideshows, this software is very basic and not user-friendly.  I had technical problems from the start.  You are better off using MS Powerpoint than this software	0
B000IBHHNY:be_aware_of_the_painful_adobe_activation_process:g._venkatesh	Please see reviews of the previous version 7.0. The Adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software. Too bad such good software is hampered by such a process. Being in the software business, I don't mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much. You might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation (and not bother you with notices of reactivation) but that also means you open it for Adobe to do their push marketing into their software. I have used Adobe products for over 15 years and have always liked them. Too bad, they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing	0
B00009ZL50:not_as_good_as_it_stated:y._hu	This dictionary is not for the person who English is his second language. It does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word. In addtion, the micro doesn't work well with MS Word.	0
B0000AZJV8:i_can't_publish_my_site_anywhere!:j._sigwing	I am not a 'professional,' but figured out how to build a website with this program, which I bought thinking that it was going to help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages, and I invested a bunch of other money in how-to books I'd ordered here, and lo and behold, the server with which I have a website I maintain for my city gov't does NOT support any sites made with this program, and then I find that NEITHER DOES YAHOO where I have my personal site and have been promoting to the city to move their official website to!!!  I've apparently wasted a lot of money and had NO CLUE this would happen when I finally put a website together with this program.  I never would have imagined Yahoo would not support the most current page builders, but it could be they want to force people to use their wizards.  WHY would Microsoft not have a patch available or something to fix this problem so this program can be used for more than just my entertainment spending hours and hours trying to learn it and build something, then find out it was for NOTHING???  Of course, both the server with the city website and Yahoo work with versions up to 2002....but I can't invest another over-$100 for the old version now just for that.  Yeah, it's great....made a pretty page, but only I can see it.  If I could publish with it, I wouldn't have just given it one star here	0
B000GI0HR2:a_different_complaint:b._murray_"oh_well"	Since most of the complaints are from recent switchers I went ahead and bought this because most of their problems don't apply to me (running on PowerPC, no old data to transfer), and because intuit offers a 60 day money back satisfaction guarantee.  Oh, and i downloaded it from their site, saving like 5 bucks.	0
B000GI0HR2:same_as_2004:megan_"nutmeg"	I have to agree with all these reviews already posted. I was getting error messages for Intuit stating that I would not be able to download stock quotes after a certain date, so I ordered a new copy of Quicken for $50 thinking it would be an upgrade. To my amazement, it is exactly the same as Quicken 04, no real developments. I feel very cheated by Intuit. If 04 was only going to be good for a couple of years, they should have disclosed the fact in the first place. If they are going to squeeze money out of loyal customers, I would at least expect and improved product. They are making a real mistake here, as their credibility is now zip. I have been buying TurboTax every year, and have been a loyal Quicken user for many years, but now I think I will look for something else.	0
26327	I was afraid at first not to order directly from Adobe but decided to take the cheaper route. It was obviously worth it - everything arrived perfectly - wrapped up, original CD set, etc.	1
51499	I have been using Adobe Acrobat for a few years now.  I've used both their Professional and Standard versions.  Now, Adobe has released Acrobat 7.  In this review, I will be discussing primarily the features of the Standard edition.  However, these features are also available in the Professional edition.  Outside of the fact that the Professional version has more workgroup-oriented and enterprise features, these programs are the basically same.  I have noted any features available only in Professional in this review.	1
76094	It does everything I hoped for and more!! As a new user of Acrobate, I am very definitely impressed... in part by the ease with which I am able to learn the program, as well as its functionality!	1
86768	I really enjoy the Nancy Drew games. They can be done as a senior detective with fewer helps or as a Junior detective with a check list of things that need to be done. The check list continues to update as you move through the game. I look forward to each new game as it comes out and can't leave the computer until they are done	1
109453	Product came in a timely manner and I love it. Easy to use and fun too.	1
127363	The new Adobe Acrobat has a cleaner look and feel, and is more user-friendly.  I especially apreciate the new quick distiller buttons in any Microsoft application, which allow you to create a PDF in one click rather than having to go to File and Print. Some functionality as before, with some new organization and better look/feel	1
129648	I have tried a few other photo editing products but I always come back to Adobe.  Easy to use and excellent results	1
149879	I bought this package because my daughter needed to be able to do word processing and make presentations for school.  I used it because its what is being used at my office.  I wish they had included Frontpage instead of One Note (which I really haven't been able to find a use for).  Otherwise, it works the same as other MS Office packages I've used in the past	1
149887	I bought this for my 3 children who are already taking computer classes in middle school.  The license allows you to install it on 3 computers so for $130 its a great deal considering that a single license of a full version of office is couple hundred	1
150319	I have been running XP for a few days and so far so good. I was running win98se and decided to upgrade after microsoft announced that they no longer support win98. My software is now obsolete? Yikes! Well, I'm glad I upgraded.	1
153219	Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice	1
168858	This package is very complete and easy to use.  Took just a few minutes to be drawing house layouts, et.  A lot of the tools are intuitive and simple	1
182499	This is an all around awesome product. I have had great experiences with the program, and use it very often as we use it to create our entire high school's yearbook. Anyone one who says it doesn't have the basics is pretty much lying to you, it has anything you'll ever need and more. The people who review this product poorly do so because they don't know how to use everything in it.	1
192249	I liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times. I always shoot with Nikon RAW format. It has hung a couple of times and I had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes.	1
199796	I had a very old version of Hallmark Studio, don't even remember how old.  Wanted to update.  I installed the program and was absolutely amazed and very happy with this product and features.  Lots of cards to choose from, very very pretty colors. The event planner is great too! The ONLY thing I would change is the ability change font in the planner, and move written info by tabbing.  Otherwise it's a wonderful program.  Highly recommended!!	1
203817	I'm not a Spider-Man fan.  I love POWERS, THE ULTIMATES, SUPREME POWER, PLANETARY and other stuff by Warren Ellis, Brian Michael Bendis, et.al.  So when I bought this, I wondered if spending a whopping $49 would be worth it.	1
228642	This is a great item for any collector or new fans to the X-men. All the older along with the newer issues look great. The CD includes all issues of the Uncanny X-men (1-461) along with Giant Sized and annual issues. There is also comprehensive biographies on the more popular characters and artwork and layouts of the Xaiver Institute. Could it of had more content, maybe, but this will keep one busy for a long time. With easy maneuverabiltity, this is a highly addictive CD with virtually months of entertainment	1
228648	I loved the X-Men cartoon in the 90s and Fox, and always liked reading the graphic novels in Barnes and Noble and the like.  However, I just never had the time or money to get into it like I wanted.  This collection is a great way for us beginnings to understand the depth of the mythology and see the transformation of the series over the years.  Reading the first 60 issues was a trip -- seeing how the characters were developed, both the art and their literary personality.	1
232527	Not bad, however, in Version 10, was able to use CNTRL + to zoom in.  Used the + on the number pad -- now this function doesn't work, and the only + that works is that in the top row of the keyboard.  The zoom out "-" in the number pad still works, but not the plus.  I say that's not good.	1
249892	You can read it BEFORE buying the product by looking on the ZA site. I'm going to make this hard and make you google it.	1
253916	I bought Version 5 of this software a few years ago and was very pleased with the many features.  A tech at my Isp (BellSouth) recommended this software to me. I recently purchased version 6 for my new laptop which is running Windows Xp Pro.  Installation was a snap.  Updates are frequent and install quickly with my Dsl connection.  The software suite has in my opinion more and better features than Norton Pro which I use on my desktop.  I really like the Registry cleaner (fixer) and the defrag tools.  (They use Trend Micro for virus protection) The program allows simple maintenance or for more experienced users indepth tools that allow you to maintain and tweak your system. There is a lot of extra programs that come with this software that I did not install after reading some reviews and warnings about using them.  However, my personal experience after installing just the System Suit 6 Professional has really been good for me. I bought my copy from Walmart and filled out the rebate following the instructions carefully and I received my rebate after about 6 weeks.  I hope if anyone buys this software because of my recommendation will have similar results.  I would rate my knowledge of computers as above average, which may be why I did not have any problems with the software.	1
286420	I discovered this software by accident, while window shopping, and I ended up buying it and taking it home.  I was able to get it up and running pretty quickly, and was creating my own music right out of the box.  Of course it takes some time, but this program makes it possible to make some pretty good music in your spare time.  Add a mic to your computer,and you can pretty much turn your computer into a recording/editing studio, make your own music and burn it to CD.  Sounic Foundry also makes it easy to publish your work to the web, by providing an online community of Acid music-makers who review and comment on one anothers' work.  You can also listen to music published by other users.  Even if you're just a musical legend in your own living room, this makes it easy and fun to become just that.  Sound Forge also sells music loops on CD especially for Acid, but you can find lots of free loops on the web that also work.  Sound Forge also provides weekly samples for free on their Acid Planet website	1
296974	I am a veteran screen printer and am kind of new to the graphic arts side.  This purchase has paid for itself over and over now that I don't have to run to someone else for art.  It was rumored that it is hard to find what is needed as there is no computer search for images...  I guess some people are too lazy to familiarize themselves with the book of images...  I did and I LOVE this product!!!!	1
300870	Homesite is widely recognized as "the" premier tool for coding HTML, client side, and server side code by hand. Adding it to your resume won't land you a job, but it will certainly boost your chances of getting an interview because it indicates that you are not a cheap, WYSIWYG junkie.	1
313338	I am very happy with it but it doesn't live up to my expectations.	1
321000	I am amazed what this program can do. It is a big difference from PS 5.5. It is a new learning curve but well worth it. What used to take me hours to do is now an action and done in 2 minutes. Amazon had the best price for me from a source I trust ordering from. It is worth it	1
321009	I have Fireworks, Corel Paint, and now CS2 to choose from. Perhaps it's my familiarity with PhotoShop that makes me so partial to it, but I feel it's the best imagery software on the market. I upgraded to this from PS7, so I missed out on CS, but from what I can tell, this is the smoothest-running version yet. I've not encountered any problems with system or support... I guess everyone's experience is different. But this is great software, and the Vanishing Point feature is just brilliant	1
343779	The software does a lot of great things.  You can start basic and work your way up to the more difficult tasks.  The system does run a bit slow and takes a long time to shut off but other than that, it is great software	1
368542	This program is fantastic. It's super easy to use and has a calendar that will notify you of upcoming events/holidays/etc. There are loads of pre-made cards to choose from or you can edit them to your needs. You can also make your own card without any help. The same thing for envelopes!	1
374326	Love this product.  I like having these Microsoft programs without paying the price for the full versios	1
374985	I have been using Microsoft Operating Systems for a very long time, and, i still say that this is the best System out there, for many reasons.	1
379403	Version 6 seemed to go off the track by changing many users' favorite features, like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become. More than anything, version 7 increases one's ability to collaborate securely, providing complete control over your document, who can open, print, or even comment on it. But version 7 is more of a fix than a major upgrade, as it cures many of the ills of the previous version. Best of all, Adobe has kept the price the same. Very nice	1
402815	I feel Home Designer Suite 6 is a good value for the price. It obviously is not a full blown pro program, which I think many people expect, however it is a great tool for an ordinary person to do preliminary plans for new construction or remodeling. Those plans can then be provided to a architect or builder as a foundation for final planning. It is quite easy to learn the basics by merely following the tutorials in the manual, or on the provided CD	1
420031	The product is easy to use.  Like how it intergrates with MS Office applications.  It's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients	1
423055	Adobe has totally re-done the interface to streamline it and make it cleaner from versions prior to CS.  If you are a QuarkXpress user, you'll find that in InDesign CS2, you get the feeling that it is laid out in a logical and easy-to-use manner.  The tools and tool palettes are where you'd expect them to be in the menu structure and on the screen.  Small touches like being able to save your workspace, like you can do in Photoshop CS2, are great.	1
444988	I bought this CD for my two grandchildren for Christmas. They have all the other Nancy Drew CD's that are out and really enjoy playing them. They are a good interactive game to challenge their minds. I am sure this one will too	1
446389	Although not perfect, I've used Roxio CD/DVD 6 Platinum and Nero 6, and returned to using this product. This should also be called &quot;Burning CD's for Dummies&quot;, it is THAT easy to use. I've also used it to burn VCD's without a hitch. If all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler, this is for you	1
449217	I am enjoying this new card shop they have refreshing great cards others do not. My friends and family that I have made cards for think they are the best also. Keep making more and more. Thank	1
493323	Nice collection of the complete issues, though, of course, one knows going in that the later Marvel practice of storylines that run through all the books makes the stories provided only a small slice of the full story, which is somewhat frustrating.	1
499115	This new version of Illustrator is great, glad I upgraded! The Live Trace feature is cool	1
510660	Maybe I'm just not pro enough to realize the ways to put some more precise reports together, but that is the only snag in this otherwise capable product.	1
527872	Previously I owned ColorVision's Spyder2 program and was quite satisfied with it.  It did not include, however, a program for correcting the printer's color rendition. The new Spyder2Pro includes PrintFix Plus.  This along with the monitor correction Spyder2Pro works very effectively.  I am very happy with the program. For the price it is a great addition to Photoshop editing.  The Spyder program allows the monitor and printer to show a print that reflects what the user has taken in his digital camera. I have not found any particular negatives about the program.  In the past I have used their tech service for fine tuning the program.  They were very responsive and helpful.	1
568193	I just upgraded my Webster software to this version for WinXP.  It's ok and does the job it's intended to perform. But I liked the previous versions that displayed both the definitions and the thesaurus in parallel panels. Just a matter of display preference, so it's not that important to every user.	1
580751	i have a question about this.  I'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it.  Is that possible on this program?  Cause my friend has Acid Pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money.  Wut i liked about Acid  Pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that, so im wondering if you can do that on this program.  If u have an answer for me, e-mail me at PeepilotT@aol.com .	1

596813	Good for those looking for a vector collection.  Not so good for those looking for photo clip art, as photos are "high-res" at 200 DPI.  I suppose the photos are useful to an extent, but the usefulness is limited by size.  I was looking for vector art, so I am satisfied	1
602554	Great program but the fact that you can't lock the toolbar into place leads to major amounts of time wasted.  Homesite kind of peaked at version 3 when it was run by Alaire	1
607037	A good choice for newbies that love adventure games.  Nancy Drew's games are perfect, fresh, relaxing, but also give you a lot of thinking some times	1
B000JK64B0:autoroute_europe_2007:r._a._cardon	If you have used MS Streets & Trips, then you'll know your way around AutoRoute.  We are using this to plan a trip to Europe next May.  Based on my knowledge of locations in Britian, the software appears to be pretty accurate.  If you want to use this with a GPS that does not come bundled with the package, expect some frustration.  I still have not figured out how to get it to talk to my USB based Garmin unit.  I think it is possible, just do not know how.	1
B000GP1666:good,_but_read_the_fine_print_(raw_users_beware):bigtone	For those already familiar, I was excited about this edition when it was advertised that it now works with RAW files.  This one of the advantages that Adobe Photoshop Elements has.  I have a Nikon Digital SLR and I often shoot in RAW and have to convert to .jpg if I want to edit with Microsoft Digital Imaging.  When I went out to buy this "Anniversary" edition, in very small print it reads that it's the same as the previous 2006 edition "except" support for RAW files is no longer included.  Still, it was on sale ($24) and I thought an upgrade would be cool.  When I used it, I saw little or no difference in this than the Microsoft Digital Image 10 I had already been using.  In my opinion, upgrading from 10 isn't worth it.	1
B000H22RBG:nice_price_for_desktop_publishing:j._spears_"neicy10"	I checked around before making this purchase, and Amazon had the best price for Print Shop.  I love it, I've used it for a couple of projects and I have no complaints.  It's like a one stop shopping for all your publishing needs	1
B000HLT4Y0:great_but_not_easy:g._johnson	I've only just begun using this software, but have not found it to be so easy to use for a novice at film editing or to make a slideshow. I would have liked to have seen better and more tutorials. I find the tutorial confusing. So far I have been able find most of the answers to my questions through the Help section, but it just isn't as straight forward as I would have liked. I purchased this b/c it was rated so high by PC Magazine. I'm sure in time I'll learn the software better, but it just seems more challenging and not as easy to learn as most sofware I have taught myself to use.	1

B000IAOIXW:norton_antivirus_2007_works_fine_with_windows_vista,_is_faster_than_before,_and_has_a_firewall:e._ramsey	I installed Norton Antivirus 2007 immediately after installing Windows Vista, Office 2007 and other software on a new computer.  Installation ran smoothly.  LiveUpdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch.	1
B000AA879Q:should_be_called_cad_for_dummies....:b._hartford_"seeker_of__simplicity_in_life"	I was a little skeptical about this program  - until I tried it last evening for the first time. I am really impressed.....  I did not even use the tutorial before I dove in and tried to play a bit.  I created a single room in less than 3 minutes, using simple walls, doors, windows, and a fireplace.  Adding flooring and coloured walls was so easy it was almost sinful!  LOL	1
B000FRTTVY:work_great!:tanat_vaniyapong	I have got a virus that cause files "comment.htt" appeared in many folders and my previous antivirus can detect them but can not destroy that virus. I tried to use another 2 antiviruses but not effective. So I try KAV and it works! Also KAV does not slow my computer like some big-named antivirus. Autoupdate feature is cool. We do not have to click anything and the prize is reasonable	1
B000HE4OJM:don't_buy_retail_like_i_did!:james_m._kelley_jr._"mnvols"	Not sure how I got it, but I got a browser hijacker that adaware and spybot wouldn't get rid of.  On top of that I got a trojan that these programs and my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid of.  So out of desperation to do something quickly, I went to B.Buy and bought this for $40.  They didn't have a large selection, so I put down the money for it.  Imagine my  feeling when I saw it on amazon for $20.  Still this product works well.  It made me uninstall spybot, adaware, and  turn off my windows firewall to install it.  You can install it on 3 different computers, or it asked you to switch your license from one of them, should you install it a fourth time.  So you can install it more than 3 times, you jsut have to switch your lisenses..understand?  Product works very well and got rid of my problems.  You get updates for 1 year, and then you have to renew.  I think this is stupid personally, but its the Trend now days.  Its a rip...you pay $40 for spyware or virus protection and it should be good for more than a year.  Several annoying windows pop up from time to time asking me what I want it to do.  I wish there was some default user setting so the program could do it.  The firewall slows down your connection, but they all do.  I have 3MG DSL and my speed test are down around 1300K, so I've lost alot of bandwith.  I guess its worth the protection.  Before with spybot and adaware, the spyscans would typically find 25+ issues of spyware.  Now with Trend Micro, I find only 5 to 10 issues on my weekely scan.  So I'm happy with the product, except for my decrease in DSL speed	1
B000JD3AIW:easy_to_use:booman_"boogieman"	No brainer.	1
B000LP6JKY:roxio_toast_8_rocks!:silvana_macri_"koalabear"	Bought this primarily for my TIVO set, so I could transfer and burn DVD's from my  TIVO box. Once I hooked up my mac G5 to the TIVO box, Toast worked perfectly. Easy interface, fast transfer, easy to burn. It's nice to know that TIVO supports Mac. A great product!!	1
B000LP6JKY:better_than_idvd:philip_j._marshall_"photomars"	This product is great.  It is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording.  The addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner.  The only problem I have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd.  If you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need.  Don't wast time with anything else	1
B000JD3AL4:easy_to_use_and_accurate:louis_a._cianciulli	I found Turbotax easy to use.  It gave me the flexibility of filling in individual forms rather than using the interview process.  Since I am an experienced tax preparer, I found this feature welcome	1
B000JLSQLU:nice_software:gordon	OK, it is big (4 CDRs).  And a full install will require over 2.35 GB.  But it loads quickly and offers nice greeting card variety along with pretty sophisticated card customization options on all pages of the card.	1
B000DN7M7I:still_the_best:v._perkins	I've always preferred WordPerfect to Word.  I find it is easier to use, more intuitive, and allows more control over documents.  It is less buggy, and I have yet to find one thing that Word does better than WP.  This new version of WP is even better than the old, and I can use it more now because it seamlessly converts documents to and from Word.	1
B000IBVVL8:check_your_web_host_first:j._donovan_"jtd"	A good product but like a lot of Microsoft releases, not everyone outside of Microsoft is ready for it.  Check with your web hosting service first to be sure they support sites developed with Expression Web.  That is a problem I have run into.  In fact some hosting services that support Front Page, haven't even come to full support of Front Page 2003 let alone Expression Web. You could end up changing hosting services to take full advantage of this product and its features	1
B000IAMRU8:norton_antivirus_2007_-_3_users:william_t._tirri	The only problem that I had,was loading the actual program on the three computers that I have.You had to delete your old Norton AntiVirus 2006 before starting.Also I have one more problem that after I loaded the Norton AntiVirus 2007 - 3 Users on the last computer I still get a error that I need to down load the latest updates,which I already did	1
B000I4RMFE:great_product:d._kiley	I previously had Nero 6 and it had tons of bugs for me. I upgraded to 7 ultra enhanced when I upgraded my computer to Vista premium, and I was pleasantly surprised. Everything I have tried so far has been flawless.	1

B000DN7JMQ:a_quality_improvement_._._.:b._wilson_"dausha"	If you look at my review history, you may note that I've given very few five-star reviews. I save five stars for outstanding products. I believe Wordperfect X3 is best described as outstanding.	1
B000HCVR3K:finally,_a_real_office_upgrade:john_b._west	It seems the last few Office releases I have purchased haven't really offered anything different, but this one does.  The interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to.  I would suggest upgrading to Office 2007 when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project.  The new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly.  If you aren't into change and prefer the status quo of the standard, File Edit Tools...layout, then this product is not for you.  If you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout (it's quite easy) you won't be sorry because it's well worth it.	1
B000B8P8VM:great_product:gary_reichenbach	QuickBooks is an incredible product. If you have never used it before try having someone walk you through it	1
B0000DBYKK:easy_to_play,_easy_to_load,_easy_to_love!:anita_amesse_"anita"	This game is great!  After buying Mia Reading I thought it was a great idea to get my 2 girls to start learning Spanish since we live in a global village. They game was easy to load, easy to navigate and the level was perfect for beginners. The high quality 3D animation will blow you away. Even my husband who learned 3D animation at the Vancouver Film School was blown away. The best part is, that they love playing it as they think it is a game. They forget they're learning numbers and vocab and how to put together simple sentences. Well recommended	1
B000HCT5DY:at_last_paint_shop_for_photos:barry_wise_"barry"	Like many other long term hobby digital photo fans I have used Paint Shop Pro for more than 10 years from version 4. It has always been a frustration that the programme was written for creating paint type graphics and photos were almost an add on. As Digital photography became more and more a real option the earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro became more of a frustration and I tried everything else. At last Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo feels like it was written for photo editing. It is easy to use with all the assistance a beginner could want, but dig deeper and it will go wherever you want to go, and more. I'm sad to see Paint Shop Album almost redundant, but it is great to have the organiser on tap. It runs on a less than optimal computer system unlike others that are too large and slow for many of us to consider.	1
B000HCV1KY:photo_software_that_is_easy_to_learn_and_use:diane_cipollo	Snapfire and Snapfire Plus are new photo software from Corel. Snapfire was recently released as a free download and Snapfire Plus is a budget priced upgrade which adds more advanced features.	1
B000CABE44:pretty_decent_product.:cecilia_l._diaz	I purchased the mangadebut because i wanted to dabble in tones and inking (which I usually never do, usually I just scan in the sketch and then darken it with a photo editing.) I came to find out that using lines and erasing the sketch makes for a much more clean finished product. Of course, you could acomplish this with MS Paint if you really wanted to.	1

B000FJSA2G:substitute_or_institute?:poetry_reader_"brad"	I'm an old school comic book collectors and I bought this in order to see what the technology has done with the print page.  This is more about collecting the stories than it is about collecting the art--and I still find there's no substitute for the feel of those magical pages	1
B000FJSA2G:waited_30_years_for_this_product:migolfer	When I was a kid, I religiously read many of the Marvel comics. The Avengers was one of my favorites. In my dreams I would have loved to have read all of the issues, but the expense would have been (WAY) too much. Now, after so many years the opportunity is finally here. I was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore, but I took a chance and bought this DVD anyway. It was worth it - by a mile. I am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed #1 as much as I would have as a kid. It will take a long time to get through them all, but I'll enjoy every minute. Stan Lee, thank you for such a simple pleasure. Great stuff for kids of all ages	1
B0000950SM:fun_way_to_learn_the_rules_of_chess:laura_de_giorgio_"www.deeptrancenow.com"	This software is focused on learning the rules of the game.  Movement of different pieces and pawns is demonstrated through an assortment of arcade-type games.  There are some decent books for learning chess for beginners, but learning through a computer game program makes it much easier and more fun.	1
B000EXW51K:registry_mechanic:francis_d._groboski	Registry Mechanic by PC Tools is an absolute must for managing one of the gray areas of Windows.  Easy to use.  Immediate boost in speed. Great price. A "must have". 5 stars.	1
1414302118:excellent_bible:brandi_r._drury_"bdrury"	This Bible is wonderful! It's written in language that is easy to understand. Many people give up on trying to study the Bible because the language is so different from the way we speak now. You won't have that problem with the New Living Translation, and the notes are so helpful. Whenever I'm unclear about a verse or the context, I check the notes, and usually they help me to understand the meaning. They also help me to understand traditions of the time and meanings that were implied to the readers of the time. Whether you've been a Christian for 50 years, or you're only thinking of trying to read the Bible for the first time, or you're anywhere in between, this Bible is a great choice	1
B000HCTYTO:vista_is_awesome:c._sanford_"i_crush_cowards"	I don't know what other people are complaining about. I just installed Vista Ultimate a few days ago and I absolutely love it. No interface lag or any other lag at all. Maybe the people complaining have weak or outdated hardware. Those people need to turn down their settings if their not going to keep their computers on the cutting edge or at least near it. I'm glad Microsoft isn't waiting for people to catch up and are on the cutting edge. I'd rather be the one catching up than the other way around.	1
B000HCTYRG:excellent:robert_mencia	I've been using Streets & Trips for years. I'm a real estate broker and use it every day. great product. Not as up-to-date as yahoo maps but easier and faster to use, particularly the route planner, gps, live local links, etc	1
B0008GM97I:wonderful:theodore_g._hatter	Can't say enough for it. There is so much good work items in it that you probably will never touch them all. I've had every updated issue from issue 5 on up. They have been consistrantly excelant	1
B0008GM97I:cs2_review:philip_w._baker	Great improvement in Photoshop technology.  I've greatly improved my ability to process astrophotography.  It's now much easier to make the same changes to multiple images of the same celestial object.  Greatly reducing the time required to process multiple images for stacking, aligning and combining.	1
B000H4EO6K:super_realistic_race_sim..._not_an_arcade_game:roger_burens_"gamer_guru"	This is a very good racing simulator!  But it's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you!	1
B0000CA1IE:wouldn't_be_without_it!:diane_nord	I currently have version 1.0 on my pc. It does everything it claims to and does it flawlessly. It cleans internet cache, history, cookies and more! I've tried another internet privacy program, but it failed to clean up the tracks that this program successfully cleaned. I especially like the fact that it cleans the autocomplete entries in my internet search and internet browser. Others can use my pc, and won't be able to see what documents I've recently opened, which programs I've recently run, or what I've searched for and what sites I've visited online. And that's the way it should be! This program can be set to clean up this information securely (can be set to wipe not just delete the info). Another plus, it can clean usage tracks for all users on a pc. The program I tried on my other pc only worked with administrator accounts (and not very well may I ad)	1
B000HLT4TU:worth_your_money:j._rodriguez	I initially purchased Creator 9 to do the same thing this software does, but the only thing is it didnt hang my computer when it came down to burn the DVD.  This software is pretty much easy to use, comes with two (Bibles) manuals, plenty of information in there to creat some good videos.  I recommend buying this or you can always buy Creator 9 have it crash your system and then spend a few days trying to review other products out there that have gotten good reviews such as this one. You will be happy with the videos you make. You can make a video containing still images (pictures), video from camcorder camera or from your computer, add text in the movies, add background music, its awesome.  I must say again it wont hang your system. Please get it, your family and yourself wont be disappointed.	1
B000K2PA3A:taxcut:darlene_alton_"admin"	TaxCut has been very reliable information and easy to use when preparing your taxes.  I have used it over the past several years.  Updates are easy to download and the software is great.  This year the software arrived on a USB key.  This is the easiest and best way to obtain the software.  Small, easy to store and is reusable.  I will continue to use TaxCut in the future	1
B000DT9356:a_good_teaching_tool,_but_characters_and_graphics_seem_to_be_low_budget.:j._ayers	I bought this for my four girls.  they all love it, ad are learning lots.  but the quality of the graphics, characters, and even theme (or story) seem to be low budget.  We have a lot of other educational computer games which are just fun for even me to watch (and play).  The overall quality in our other games is much higher.  It is a lot like comparing Disney cartoons to Speed Racer.	1

B000EGM3QO:do_some_homework_before_you_install_security_products!:solomanwise_man_"s_man"	I am a computer repair tech and I can bet 90% of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs. You should never install more than 1 antivirus program into your OS. Most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that, double installs. PLEASE PLEASE ..remove/uninstall any previous antivirus programs and 3rd party firewalls. then reboot..use a good registry cleaner-freeware program like CCleaner to remove leftover registry keys, then reboot again and then and only then install your new Antivirus/Security program. I have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system, it works great. A very good product at a very good price. I can't comment on it's tech support, I have never used it	1
B00063E980:great_product_with_minor_irritations:jenni_l._schuerr	This is a great PDA Bible for many reasons, several of which are already mentioned in other reviews.  It is easy to use, has most of the NIV Study Bible notes and crossreferences, comes with a multi color highlighter (great for using different colors for different purposes...red for commands, blue for promises, etc.), you can change the font for easier reading, and it has a great search engine in case you want all of the references to, say "peace" that occured in the New Testament.  The programs that come with it are nice as well, including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the Bible in one year, the OT in one year, the NT in one year, and many more options.	1
B000HED3BW:naturally_speaking_9_cuts_down_time:k._jenkins	I travel quite a bit and am able to use the digital recorder to take notes while driving.  It has saved me a lot of time and works well	1
B00068IBZW:good_product,_but_no_rebate:steven	I found the product to work very well for antivirus, spyware and spam.  It is nice to have one product at a reasonable price that has multiple functions rather than 3-4 sperate products and their associated cost and maintenance.  I had been using Norton 2004, but it only did a good job on viruses.  Although it would detect spyware after the fact, it did a poor job of removing them.  I had also used the MS beta, which although detected more spyware than Norton, would not block it.  I had one computer that always seemed to be crippled with spyware.  Since I installed PC-Cillin, I've had no problems.  I've also found the spam blocker to work fairly well, catching about 80% of the spam.  I had been using multiple rules and a spam list with outlook, that probably only blocked about 40% of the spam, so this is a big improvement.	1

B000FL2DQS:disasterlad_on_encarta_2007:stephen_end_"disasterlad"	I enjoy using Encarta 2007 and can relie upon their information. I use it in conjunction with Britannica 2007 to get the most well rounded information. I do prefer the interface and ease to Britannica 2007 but the quality of information on Britannica is always to be trusted.	1
B000IN4UAK:goodbye_norton!__hello_panda!:vipermike	I purchased Panda Internet Security 2007 for two reasons: The price after rebates (Free) and the fact that it is a 3-user license.  After switching from McAfee to Norton (and a subsequent 1-year renewal) I decided to either buy PC-Cillin 2007 or try Panda. (39.99 or Free...hmm...)  I installed Panda on my laptop first (after uninstalling Norton Internet Security 2005).  No problem what-so-ever.  In the initial HDD scan, Panda found and cleaned 5 files that were found in my email inbox identified as a worm.  I then installed Panda on 2 desktop machines with no problems there either.  Panda found 3 traces of spyware on one machine and nothing on the second.	1
B0001F0XHE:worth_every_penny,_saved_me_several_headaches_and_fixed_my_computer!:ca_girl	This is great! The free trial version on download.com had saved my computer (the only program that got rid off some spyware that was in my start-up and causing lots of problems). And I've also used the trial version on several of my friends' computers. It hasn't picked up much, though, since I bought it. But that's probably because now I have a new hard drive and a firewall. Before, I  bought the computer used and didn't know what a firewall was. I should have saved the disk and installed it when I started having problems. But oh well, it's doing it's job and if I start having problems once the CD expires, then I will probably buy a new disk. That's how good it is	1
B000B5I0O2:worth_trying_a_new_anti-virus:mar,_ny.	I have Windows XP which came with McAfee.

This free version never times out. You can immediately download 400m or get the CD with no shipping charge. The big limit in the free upgradeable version is you only get 20 total customers and vendors, so it is ideal for students and those with limited needs	1
B000DT87W6:does_exactly_what_it's_supposed_to:fersal_"fersal"	All I needed was to upgrade the hard drive on my Dell laptop, so I got Acronis True Image version 9 for half the price of the current version 10.	1

B000FCA0P8:perfect_-_no_tech_skills_needed_-__easy,_goof-proof!:a_student_of_history	Don't think about video capture cards, going into the operating system, or even opening the computer case - just turn on the power, plug Dazzle's USB plug into your usb port, and connect the colored cords on your vcr with the same colored plugs on Dazzle, install the software, and let this wonderful tool do all of the heavy lifting.	1

B000M9CMC8:nearly_perfect_tool:joe_rizzia_"i_grew_up_on_comics"	This is a great software for Photographers looking for a faster way to manager and edit images. I gave it a four because I would hope that ADOBE would still find ways to improve this product. The functionality is superb, and for such a great program, it doesn't eat too much memory on your computer (I have a 4 year old PC with 768 MB of RAM). And because of this I'm shooting more pictures in RAW format and not worry about the time I spend in front of the computer.	1
B000HCTYSU:vista_windows_business_upgrade_(dvd):pamela_foote	i really like my new windows vista upgrade.the graphics are stunning and it is extremely user friendly.infact, i liked vista business so much, i upgraded to the ultimate version.both versions are very easy to install;many people seem to be waiting for 'all the bugs to be worked out' but, honestly, the bugs aren't a problem.it is important to run the advisor about -is your system ready for vista before you install- to get rid of any conflicts your computer might have with vista;other than that everything else is a breeze. Use my system about 6 hours a day and am using a xps 700 dell computer go for it, you'll have lots of fun!	1
B000BWZZLG:ummm_lets_see_osx..._i_wish_i_had_four_thumbs_so_i_give_it_fuor_thumbs_up!:macson	yeah its great. get rid of ur piece of DOO-DOO windows operating system and pick yo self up dis! aight piece yallz. and remember once yo go mac ya neva go back	1
B0006N99K8:kid_pix_deluxe_4_review:wind_raven	Great product.  My child has autism spectrum disorder and this is a program that holds her interest.  She really likes the different music she can select and says some of it helps to calm her down.  I love it	1
B000H28RZG:great_product:john_m	Excellent product works as advertised and so simple to use. Product well packaged, arrived earlier than expected and in mint condition. ScanSoft responded with an eMail in a timely fashion acknowledging receipt of my Rebate paperwork and provided a pin number for me to access their site to check on it's progress. But you know Rebates....they take forever!	1
B000DT7ONE:great_program_..._if_used_in_conjunction_with_others:gooup_"gooup"	CorelDraw was my first foray into vector graphics back when version 3 showed up on my desk at the small "Mom and Pop" screenprinting shop i worked at. Back then, Corel came with OODLES of free fonts, clipart, manuals ... not to mention FREE technical support via a toll-free number.	1
B0009QUV72:easy:gail_ansara	I love this product. I had so many pictures that need to be in a scrapbook. This was so fast and easy, also it only took a couple of weeks to complete. I didn't over spend on paper,tape,glue, and etc. With three kids I don't have the time to sit down and cut, measure and more. with all my pages completed. I added a FEW things to go along with the theme of my page. I even used left over Christmas wrap to fill the 12X12 for Christmas pictures/theme	1
B000FQ9R9O:great_read!!:k._bernard	I had a hard time putting this one down. I quickly read through the entire collection and it was over too quickly. I would recommend this to any X-men fan especially fans of the old comic books and it certainly takes up a lot less room than if I had the hardcopy versions.	1
B000B628OE:i_have_never_seen_a_game_like_this_ever_before.__it's_so_intelligent!!!_:trish_l.	First of all, I want to make the point that this is a strategy based tycoon game and a sim game.  It is really well done using superb graphics and animations.  You get to apply new discoveries in your factories so you can make a better product and out sell them to your competitors.  It all seems to be based on real history so you get information from real sources like the Wright brothers, Edison and even Einstein. And you also have to worry about the people that work in your factories, your scientists, and accountants and even worry about industrial espionage. If you like business, engines, buildings, science and physics, you'll be getting hours and hours of play out of this game.  You also get to play in a bunch of different cities in the world.  Each one has different challenges. It's fresh every time you play since you can do things differently and see how the results vary	1
B000HCXKMG:very_sensitive_and_accurate:starship_trooper	I have been a long time user of Delorme Products but decided to get a combination of Microsoft products both for the US and Europe (Autotrip).	1
B000HE7M3M:good_solid_product:garok	Xitel INport Deluxe does what it says it does.  You can plug in any RCA AUX connector into the unit and with the software provided you can record it in stereo to your computer.	1
B000HE7M3M:awesome_product:lavon_h	I received this product and have been using it for a couple of weeks.  It is exactly as advertised.  It is very easy to use and the software is extremely user friendly.  I am amazed at the quality of the recordings.  I would definately recommend this product	1
B0002DODZ8:streets_and_trips_:charles_s._aaron_"rvtraveler"	Streets and Trips has been a significant help in making our travel plans. We use it in conjunction with our Garmin 2720 GPS system and they are very complementary. The Garmin system doesn't use downloads from the laptop and Streets and Trips therefore allows us to do trip planning on a braosder scale at home. This is a very good program for trip planning	1
B000BYSX4A:missing_the_online_registration_code:h._worley	This is a cool game in a lot of ways.  I was jazzed about it because of the era it represents.  But the complexity and inscrutability of the setup menus is somewhat offputting.	1
B000HCTY2G:better_than_the_rest!:d._joosten	This is the best version of Office yet. The differences are numerous and very significant, it is well worth the investment!	1
B000BB46JY:acronis_disk_director_suite_10.0:robert_kelly	The item was received promptly and worked perfectly. Thanks for a great purchase.	1
B000HBVVG4:quickbooks_love_hate_relationship_-_insight_from_long_time_user:don_thrul	Love the program.... Hate the company!	1
B000FQVXG4:must_have!:dennis_j._duffy_"mortgage_maven"	Use it with new Xerox Scanner and once the correct set up is utilized, it works wonders. Very satisfied	1
B0001F0XK6:perfect_simple_solution_with_no_fuss:mary_"mary"	Simple and easiest to use of T Shirt programs.  Don't be put off by the low prices.  Simply Magazine, with their Simply Media brands, have lots of craft products like this, with all of them on Amazon I think.	1
B0009RENAW:no_complaints:f._choate	I bought Finale Songwriter to make lead sheets with chord symbols.  It worked well for my project.  I have no complaints.	1
B000HKPD5K:best_firewall_for_home_use:l._jonathan_kramer	I bought ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite for the included ZoneAlarm Pro firewall (it cost much less that way).  If I didn't already have Norton Antivirus, I'd use the antivirus, too	1
B000HCZ9AC:easy_cool_upgrade:s._moore	At home, I've been a Mac user since 1991. I also have been something of a Linux fanatic too and have used several distros, mostly Red Hat and now Fedora Core. At work, however I have used MS-DOS, Windows 3.11, 95, 98 and XP. It's fair to say I have never liked Microsoft. But on a laptop I use at work (an older Gateway 400VTX with a 2.2GHz Intel Celeron), I just upgraded to Vista Home Basic. I also upgraded the memory to its maximum 1GB. And despite my years of eschewing Microsoft, guess what? I must say I really like the OS. It runs fine on my slower system and I had no problems installing and no conflicts with drivers.	1
B0000C4M1W:great_for_learning_to_play_simple_songs:kevan_kwong	I am an adult trying to learn Piano.  This program is great for learning simple songs and does have a very good feedback system.	1
B000CS3SFO:after_30_minutes,_i'm_ready_to_uninstall_golive!:m._cox	I'm an amateur at website design/building, so understand that I'm not very "deep" in Dreamweaver's abilities. However, I got the program to switch from Adobe GoLive CS2 which had many quirks, bugs, and frustrations. (One example - while you upload your changed files to the web server in GoLive, you can't do anything else in the program. Single tasking!?!?!) After just 30 minutes or so of working with Dreamweaver to update my site, I'm already sure I've made the right decision! I have a long way to go in learning what it can do, but my first impressions of the product are excellent	1
B000B8K7WM:does_the_trick:bradley_l._smith_"napa_brad"	QuickBooks lives up to it's reputation of being the one-size-fits-all small business book keeping software.  It does what you want it to do.  I like the feature of being able to easily sent e-mail invoices.  If you need the software right away it is just as cheap at the office supply stores	1
B000HKN4W4:it_works_good:rajeev_k._kaza	I am satisfied with the product.  For that matter I know it before I bought and I am satisfied with it.  The only glitch is it will take some time to start and until it starts we may not be able to browse or use any applications that needs internet.  Still I would suggest it is a best option to buy one for ur computer safety	1
B000EGIDPY:love_this_program:anna_jarrett	I have been using Printmaster Platinun for several years and love it. I scrapbook constantly using all of the features. I have printed thousands of items with this program. If  people have problems with the program it is because it uses alot of memory and the problem is their computer.  I have gotten rid of 10 scrapbook, photo programs and only use Printmaster. There is no better program.  Ann	1
B000HCTY26:microsoft_office_ultimate_2007:timothy_e._brummel	Microsoft Office Ultimate 2007 is fairly good once you know how to use it. It is a a little difficult if you are new to how the menus work but once you know how they work it is fairly simple to use	1
B000JTFVME:vista_coupon:beaker	Don't get confused by the licensing mumbo jumbo that comes on the package. It is the full version ready to be installed. Don't forget to plan out your disk partitioning strategy before you start. So far, I have not noticed a dime's worth of difference from the Pro version. It is working great.	1
B0006H1I80:great_for_conversational_or_travel:senora_gose	What a wonderful game - addictive and motivating! If you want to be able to make original sentences, you might need something more in depth with a bit more grammar, but for "Eazy Speak" this is right on the target! Fun for any computer user!	1
B000H3FUXC:excellent_software:alan_b._odom_"love_&_gratitude"	The lawsuit mentioned in Mr John Matlock "Gunny" review has nothing to do with the quality or legality of documents created using Quicken WillMaker Plus software. Instead, it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license.	1
B000BVP576:finest_internet_security_around!_take_your_pc-cillin!:anthony_g._infantino,_md_"drgonzo3003"	I was using other internet security programs in the past. All had their pros and cons. I decided to switch to PC-Cillin 2006 Home Security Pack and it is the best available!.  It has both virus and spyware protections built in. The scanning is quick and the updates are easy to get. Plus this home security 3 pack is able to be installed on 3 computers, a bargain. All in all I am sold on this easy to use and comprehensive software product. I highly recommend this product to all! Amazon.com as usual had the best price	1
B0000BX73E:microsoft__office_2003_upgrade:a._lawless	I am very pleased with the product - I had trouble with my system and Microsoft tech support was outstanding on helping me solve the issues	1
B000GHV6M8:i_love_it.:sylvia_l._hayes_"sylvia_hayes"	I love this especially for it's basic qualities.  I originally started with the version where it could be put on a 1.44 floppy that I got from my dentist, went to version 2001 a few years later. With version 2001 my bank no longer would support downloads for that it, and I knew I would have to upgrade some time.  I was comfortable with 2001 so I was glad to find this 2007 was easy to adapt to just a bit sleeker but adding my ability to download from my bank once again.  For someone who doesn't have the need for all the extras this is perfect	1
B000GHV6M8:now_i_can_balance:p._friedman_"cat_lover"	When my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing I missed the most was being able to balance my check book. Glad to be back on track. I like the new look	1
B000HCTYRQ:ms_streets_and_trips_2007:bob_jones_"rascal"	This map and trip maker is about the same as their previous versions except to my dislike, it no longer supports Windows 98, which happens to be the newest OP that my old lap top can use.  It also still lists some restaurants that have been closed for two years.  The street maps it produces are accurate, except for a few minor glitches	1
B000JD3AKA:purchased_because_it_had_no_state:raymond_d._carlson_"rdc"	This was the only place I could find Turbo Tax where I did not have to pay extra for state tax.  I live in Washington and we do not have state income tax.  I even asked Intuit how to get a version without the state tax, they said that was not possible.  I have used Turbo Tax for many years and I will buy from Amazon again next year.	1
B000IBFP1K:like_very_much:patricia_a._watson_"not_mrs._sam"	I bought Adobe Acrobat 8.0 Professional for home use after having used an older version at work.  The software was very easy to install, activate, and register; and I liked the orientation program that explained how to use the features.  Since I am active with three community service organizations, I welcome the addition to my home computer for the convenience it adds to assembling mixed media "binders." This program makes it easier to email formal reports, create handbills and pamphlets, and post them to my web page.	1
B000077DD4:excelent_for_beginners!!!:r._drake_"language_learner"	I am fluent in Spanish. So, the Rosetta Stone Italian language software, was perfect for me. It is very easy to understand, to follow and to learn. If you study one hour per day, in one week you are going to remember several words and phrases. I don't have any regret at all, I think my investment was worthwhile.	1
B000A76ZT8:microsoft_works:charles_r._glade	Works work, what cam I say. I have been using microsoft products for years. Quality easy to use products are the reason they are a software giant.	1
B000FJ9WU0:wonderful!:grass_tiger	This software is wonderful! I have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years. I've tried Broderbund (sp?) whose interface was too clumsy, Nova which was rather difficult at times (many things you can't do) and now this. When I first took this out of the package and installed it I thought I had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very, very few backgrounds, templates or embellishements even when I opened the Xtras CDs that came with this. I truly did not feel the Xtras CDs were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them. But then I found the tutorials that are included on the CD and watched the one about making collages. I didn't get halfway through the video - I had figured out how to do it. I have now created some of the best scrapbook pages I've ever made. Within hours I had a beautiful collage/letter to send with my holiday cards. My husband's first impression was a heartfelt "It's lovely". What has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that I can take ANY image and make it a background, I can create and manipulate text almost any way I want, I've been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it (.png format). I feel like I have no limitations on what I can do now. I imagine this software is not as sophistacated as Adobe Illustrator, but then it probably isn't as complicated to use (from what I remember that program has a rather steep learning curve).	1
B0009R5E50:fun_program:j._dellwo	A quick look at the first several tutorials had me up and running.  I've been able to do most of the things I've wanted to do with this program and it's delivered on most of its promises.  My wife loves it too.	1
B0007Z72OK:excellent_software:techno_mania_"techno_mania"	The engine behind this program is from Chief Architect, who, from what I understand, are developers of professional CAD software. It shows in this program.	1
B000J1H08K:bitdefender_antivirus_:stephen_t._haer	Installed quickly and with no problems. Does not slow the machine down as much as Norton antivirus.	1
B000BNGI5C:very_good_for_the_price:el_queso_grande	I bought this to use with family photos and threw together my first 5 page comic last night.  It was fairly easy to use, but not perfect.  Instructions are thin (read 'mostly nonexistant'); so it is best that you either have time on your hand OR a lot of experience using complex photo software.	1
B000HC0LW8:maccounting:bk_yogi	Most of the world still runs on PCs and as a Mac owner (and lover), it can be tough to find software for basic stuff like accounting.  I'm a guy who makes a living making stuff sound good for radio, TV, video games and so on.  As a freelancer, I need something to keep track of my business banking, credit cards, expenses and invoices and this program does just that and very intuitively, just like my Mac.	1
B000BCGFCO:nero_7_ultra_edition:g._w._lizenby	One of the best programs that I have to work with CD & DVD	1
B000AYIPFS:wow!!__bookkeeping_made_easy:carmen_borg	Other similar products were too complicated. All I wanted was something simple. I got exactly what I needed to convince myself I had my act together.  I found it in this product.  Big E-Z Bookkeeping helped me simplify my bookkeeping without the anxiety.  It's just enough for my family accounts.  Thank You	1
B000BCICV6:interior_dream:lyn_smith_"lyn"	This was my second purchase of a product like this and I loved it. The first one I tried was difficult to use. It was so easy to use. My husband and I were unsure of our remodeling plans and with this we were able to get a vision together of how our home would look once completed. It helped us pick everything from furniture location to color of carpet and flooring. My favorite feature was the Home Estimator feature that tracked our materials useage	1
B000GI0HQ8:good_program:djaman	This program is dependable and adequate within the limits that it is avertised to do. For instance, it won't keep track of inventory, since it was not designed to do so	1
B000B8NFHQ:quickbooks_premier_2006_is_easy_but_powerful:charles_p._vigeant	I have been supporting QuickBooks as a financial and technical consultant for small businesses for over a dozen years.  This year's version added a neat feature that allows you to see all of your customer's invoices, payments, estimates, - all in the same window - just by clicking on a customer in the list.  No more multiple clicks to create customer reports.  It is just plain easy, and the information pops up on your screen immediately. Congratulations to Intuit on a job well done	1
B000BAT2TE:the_best_desktop_backup_software_available:t._foley	For years I used PowerQuest's Drive Image 7 for backups. It's rock solid and totally dependable. When Symantec aquired PowerQuest they rolled the underlying technology of Drive Image 7 into Norton Ghost. The result is a very capable and reliable package that can backup partitions or entire drives and also provides support for incremental backups. Most importantly, like Drive Image 7, it provides for emergency recovery of your system. Just boot from the Ghost CD and restore the backup (restore point) that you select. I've tested this process by making both full system backups and subsequent incremental backups, and then restoring the system from those backups. The process works flawlessly. If you need to restore to a different physical drive (replaced a failed drive, etc), the process requires a few extra selections, but is still very straightforward. Just take the time to read the manual.	1
B0006B4ZR2:my_son_loves_it!!:jerry_g._guevara_"keep_your_head_to_the_sky"	I picked this up for my twelve year old son.  He is a beginner and has been glued to his electric guitar and eMedia Rock Guitar Method for the last two weeks.  The program is a great starter, just in case the kids don't stick with it.   It's better than $45 bucks an hour once a week, for now, at least.	1
1581700334:very_pleased...:v._miller_"babyv"	I really love this Bible. Even for someone who is well-versed in Bible scripture, this adds a new dimension to your understanding. I purchased one for myself and liked it so much that I purchased one for my mom for Mother's Day.	1
B0008GM6JO:there_is_no_substitute:robert_mrozowski_"film_lover"	Photoshop CS 2 is in a league of it's own. It can be used to do professional photo retouching and correcting but it is also probably the best painting package out there. It's not perfect however. There are some features that high end compositing and color grading programs like Inferno and DaVinci have that Photoshop could use, and the warper is just bare bones but then we're talking big bucks and no doubt Photoshop will eventually have something like them. Except for a few filters, it can function in 16 bits per channel which was a long time coming but now it's here, making it a professional product. Still, as far as I'm concerned, the ultimate paint program has yet to be written	1
B000FPWEF4:kaspersky_internet_security:j._holschlag	Good product Amazon had a great price.  Even though people say it is high priced I paid $44 after discounts.  I tried the Beta version and I liked it.  Beta version does not give you all of the features but enough to get the idea.  Easy to install worked at the get go.  Intuitive enough to figure it out.  You may have to go through things a few times to understand what it means.   Didn't have a manual with the Beta version and still figured it out. Manual does provide information, works great.  Didn't need any help. Had Mcafee before didn't find any new virus. It works as good as Mcafee but it is a lot faster when you start up.  Both Kaspersky and Mcafee have features I like.	1
B000E65HKI:good_points_and_limitations:brian	I've been working with Punch AS/4000 since v10.0 was released (about 12 months ago). Although I agree in many respects with the positive reviews. For example, there are is a large feature list. However, there are issues with the software. For example:	1
B0002YIDAS:the_coolest_game_about_horses:forusa_"forusa"	It is the coolest game about horses. It teaches the most important basic about caring for horses and riding horses. It is a bit confusing at the beginning and a little help from Mom or Dad should be welcome, even though my daughter found things that I did not, it's a team effort at the beginning. After that it's just very pleasurable, and can go on for ever. According to my daughter it is very addictive (!!) and she has already Dreamer and Lets ride. OK it's not high visual 3D as the others, but let's face it, a lot more entertaining.	1
B0002YIDAS:fun,fun,and_more_fun!:	At first I didnt like this game because of the graphics but once I learned how to play I really thought it was fun one time I was so interested that I woke up at 8:00am and played the whole game to 11:00pm	1
B0002808S4:great_pc_remote:elijah_miller	I am very pleased with the way this remote performs. I have my computer conected to my TV, and with this remote, I am able to control my computer from the living room, to watch TV, watch DVDs that I have on my hard drives, and listen to music. Beyond media, works great with the remote, and is very user friendly	1
B000IBJEWG:adobe_acrobat_professional_8.0:paul_miller	This is a major upgrade from previous versions . . . much easier to use and a much cleaner format	1
B0002AH0I8:learning_french_:s._b._field	I think the rosetta stone software is a pretty effective mode of learning. However, it is necessary to do it on a regular basis and would probably be even more effective if one were to study verbs and vocabulary outside of the program. In order to get the most out of the program I feel it is essential to do all the portions of each level/lesson.	1
B000H1XY3M:family_tree_maker_sheds_the_dos_look.:robert_d._miller_"bob"	After many years of the same look and marginal upgrades, Family Tree Maker finally made a serious change to the look and feel of the product. There are still some awkward navigation issues, but overall, I think this is worth a look if you are a long term user and haven't upgraded in a while or are just starting out.	1
B000HCXKKS:great_product!:carlos_rodriguez	I am not a professional reviewer or a tech guru, but based on my experience with this product I am very satisfied.  I love the new interface and how easy it is to work with documents and apply formatting with such ease.  I have only used it for a month now and I still have to use some of the applications yet.  If you have the money and will love to have a new Office Suite that can give you some happiness working with documents every day, go for it	1
B00005RG2Y:missing_some_features,_has_a_learning_curve,_overall_good:s._kettman_"topdog"	I really like OmniForm 5.  Actually I'm using version 5.1 and I'm very satisfied with it.	1
B000H1ZJ4Y:family_tree_maker_version_16:r._t._bell	I have been using the Family Tree Maker products for a number of years.  I love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts.  I am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder.  I feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly, both visually and functionally	1
B00005MOTH:excellent:sandy	The product of Windows XP- Professional is just what I was looking for with many updated features and I am looking forward in using it daily.  It was shipped exacting when they had told me to expect it.  But most of all, Service was "top knotch".  I could not have asked to better service on any questions or problems I may have had. Customer service is a plus. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this seller	1
B000DINB4G:great_improvement:thomas_cox_jr._"thomas_r._cox_jr."	I have used Corel Draw for many years, and too many had serious problems. This version seems to make up for the past with a stable system capable of most anything artistic. It is still a complicated system, though	1
B000DINB4G:corel_is_back_on_their_game!:df_"df"	I have been a user since version 4. Version 4 was bad, 5 was good, 6 was terrible, 7 was great, tried 8 & didn't see the point, 9 was stable and very good. I avoided 10. 11 is very good. In Version 12 Corel had added features that made me want to go back to 11.	1
B0009JQRW2:system_mechanic_6_professional:ronald_e._provencher	System Mechanic 6 Professional is an excellent product and it solved all the problems I was having with my computer.  It also alerts you of impending problems. I highly recommends this product.	1
B000HCTYTE:best_windows_os_yet_:s._brown_"woundering_in_nite"	I think this is the best version to come out yet. I would have a high end pc if I was to upgrade only software. I would just wait and buy a new pc. Its alot easyer then learning a new operating system and if you enable the adminstrator account and only use your standard accounts to surf the web then it give you some security. The firewall is good in the business versions and there is some good virus software out there. Its got alot more features and run's good's. Device drivers are easyier to load -scott	1
B00068M52W:exceptional_educational_software_that_is_fun!:patrick_d._goonan_"www.meaningful-life.us"	I'm not going to cover the technical drawbacks of this software except to briefly mention that you should look over other reviews before you buy.  However, despite annoying design features, this is quite an amazing piece of software!  I would certainly rate it a 5+ if there weren't some design shortcomings and undocumented features ;)	1
B00068M52W:my_kids_beat_me_at_chess_today!:learning_all_the_time_"book_lover"	My kids (6 and 8) are learning so much from Fritz and Chesster 2!!  In fact, my 6 year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game (from Fritz and Chesster 1).	1
B00005NN17:fun_&_challenging:brendlefly	My 5 and 6-year olds didn't seem to want to play, maybe too hard. I enjoyed playing and my 11-year old twins really liked it	1
B00005NN17:i_spy_-_treasure_hunt_windows_cd:kristin_m._guinn	This item was delivered in a timely manner and my son really enjoyed it. Thanks	1
B0002FGFIY:learning_fun:k._caldwell	My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present.  He has really enjoyed playing it so far.  He can do most of the activities without help.  There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain).  There are many different learning activities:  matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did.  We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP	1
B00004YUGL:great_help:maridee_jones_"whocares"	I was pleaed at how quickly I began to pick up on the language.  I plan to purchase other Rosetta Stone Products in the futur	1
B0001WN0NG:vp_7.0_is_suite_now_that_i_finally_got_it_installed!:samantha_hickey	A great bargain - you get full office Professional, VP and full version of Windows for under $300 dollars. After waiting for months and months for Office 2004 Professional to be released, when it finally came out I was ecstatic. One problem: VP 7.0 wouldn't install on my G5, only on my laptop. I called Microsoft support and within minutes they told me that they were working on a patch for machines with over 2.0 GB of ram. I downloaded the update a week later when it came out and everything is now golden. The moral of the story is that Microsoft underestimates the needs of Mac users because they are used to wimpy PCs that have no ram	1
B000G1F83M:i_keep_coming_back:j._swearingen	I came across Magix Audio Cleaning Lab about 4 years ago.  Once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.  However, I kept wondering if there were better programs out there.  I mean, really, how good can it be for $39, right?  I recently paid $75 for Sony's famed Sound Forge Studio (which is the Sound Forge program minus various some features).  I spent a lot of time with Sound Forge Studio, working to perfect my transfer of some private music recordings from cassette to CD.  I was happy with what I was able to accomplish with Sound Forge.  At least I thought I was happy.  I compared my work in Sound Forge Studio to the same cassette transfer I did with Magix Audio Cleaning Lab 10 (the previous iteration of this software).  Guess what?  I liked the Magix work much better.  So, I immediately purchased Audio Cleaning Lab 11 and unintalled Sony's Sound Forge Studeio from my computer.  Magix could charge $150 for this software and I would buy it in a second.  Your going to have to take the time to carefully read through the full manual to get the most out of this software - but it is worth the effort.	1
B0009YN1RG:great_creative_card_making_product!:gail_k._kroll	This is another great card making product but I don't believe as good as Hallmark. But? I still use it a whole lot and love it! I know you will too! Try it out! And take a chance on a great product	1
B00030096W:voice_recognition_software:_coming_of_age:j._cameron-smith	Voice recognition software continues to improve.  I've been using versions of this software since 1998 and can see significant improvements in the voice recognition technology over that period.	1
B000BKH1JC:excellet_product.__just_used_at_the_wrong_time.:ann_e._negley	We ordered this program only two weeks before moving to Bogota, Columbia for a two year tour.  However, the Spanish Rosetta Stone taught was much higher level than the survival Spanish we needed when we arrived.  Overall we are learning the language and it is a GREAT program.  Wish we would have bought it 3 or 4 months before departing	1
B000BKH1JC:almost_perfect!:gordon_l._lee	I don't understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it.  It is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did....and realize that you forgot to select "test" at the beginning.  Also, it seems that testing should be available for the 'guided exercise' also ...... not just the regular exercises.  Other than these two things, the program is very good	1
B000AR0LLG:good_product:kevin_from_il	My only reccomendation would be a better user interface, it can be a bit confusing. The underlying functions work well though	1
B000AR0LLG:money_and_time_saver:edward_lampl_-_stuart_search_group_-_president_healthcare_recruitment	We have used ScanSoft/Nuance products for over five years - As a matter of fact I am writing this review using Dragon 8. OmniPage Pro 15 along with the PDF converter is by far the best on the market. The technical support has been fantastic throughout the years and the engineers always had open ears for recommended changes. OmniPage Pro 15 has saved me thousands of dollars because of its unbelievable OCR accuracy.  With a click and a choice I can now convert a PDF document into XL as spreadsheet.  Before this technology was created it was such a hassle. When I have to fill out a form OmniPage Pro 15 uses the saved information to help me. The program can run in the background and does not freeze or slow down my system.	1
B000KZF3XE:great_product:j._s._schlatter_"jschlat"	Purchased this software to transfer files and operating system from on old laptop hard drive to a new one.  I put the new drive in a USB external case attached it to the laptop and ran the software.  In about 20 minutes and 3 mouse clicks the operation was completed and worked perfectly.  I have also used the software to image my hard drive as a backup.	1

B000BM67XG:better_than_the_alternative:e._muirhead_"lizanneh"	I started off using Turbotax this year, but returned it to the store to use Taxcut instead.

B00009ZL50:merriam_webster_medical_desk_dictionary_-_great_!!!!:k._jones	This software is very user friendly,easy to install, easy to use.  I would recommend it to anyone	1
B0000AZJV8:pretty_powerful:d._mokhtar_"dbm"	Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way.	1
B000GI0HR2:quicken_2007:geraldine_l._kedrowski_"farmers_wife"	I have used Quicken for over 12 years.  Whenever I got a new version, it always worked for me.  But, it has too many things on it that I don't need. I like to keep it more simple for me, so I just use the register, reconcile, reports, and lists-catagories. For all I use it for, I am happy with it	1

B0000C08MX:do_not_buy!!!:j._angelini	I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely!	0

B00076ZE3U:bag_itself_is_decent_but_3_of__the_4_metal_clasps_broke_withing_6_months:seth_l._bailey	The title pretty much says it all.  The bag is solid and didn't get too soft even after a good amount of use.  The big downside is that the metal clasps that are used to hang up the bag are of extremely poor quality and can't support the weight of the bag. One of the clasps actually broke in two and two of the others became bent beyond usability.  All within about six months of use.  Unless you're prepared to spot weld the clasps to reinforce them I'd look elsewhere for a heavy bag.	0
B000994UZS:bad_radio,_worse_pedometer:walker	For $20 this looked like it could be a nice light radio for walking/jogging, with a bonus pedometer.  The radio has no channel display, and the only setting is a reset button to go the bottom of the dial, then a scan button.  When walking, it loses the station occasionally - luckily my prefered station is at the bottom of the dial, but if yours isn't this could be terribly annoying.  As for the pedometer, it jumps by 10 steps just from clipping it on my waistband, and several times went zooming thru 20 or 30 steps when I was holding it perfectly still - thus worthless.  I'm sending it back	0

B000EXM2IG:the_worest_deal_ever!!!!!!!_do_not_buy_what_ever_you_do!:hello_kitty_mommy	OK so i got this gun for christmas and i open it and i'm so excited. Then i play with it, its working then i go to charge it boom. 8 hours later its dead the gun will not work. I checked the battery it has full juice. I had my dad and uncles look and try to fix this for about 2 hours they could not figure it out. Currently my uncle is going to take the gun apart and try to fix it. DO NOT BUY THIS GUN OR ANY OTHER TOYS OR AIRSOFT GUNS FROM THIS COMPANY! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS IT IS A RIP OF AND THE COMPANY HAS TERRIBLE CUSTOMER REVIEWS!

B000FE3G8E:very_poor:lawrence_corra	I bought this based on the other review.  It takes forever to inflate and when it does the seal where it does must be very poor.  All through the night it leaks air and becomes quite soft.  I am waking up during the night reinflating this thing and after an hour it is back to being deflated.  Don't waste your money like I did	0
B0002U2RKY:body_ball_blue_65cm:lin	The 'blue' body ball that was sent to me was not blue. It's white with some blue print. The pump didn't work right so I used a rocket type pump that came with a ball I had purchased from another company. Plugs and pumps seem to be interchangeable. The quality of the 'blue' ball is good. When I opened the box it looked like the ball was the wrong size but it expands to the 65cm. My first thought was wrong color, wrong size. No inflation directions enclosed in box only an excercise chart. Ball is OK, pump is not. I was not happy but didn't want the return hassle. If you aren't fussy about color and have a back-up pump, go for it.	0
B000HI5N7A:$99_for_bragging_rights.:redlinese-r	Ok, i REALLY thought this ball would be GREAT considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the NBA.  NOT SO!  This ball feels very similar to the cheap $20 balls you can get at your local department stores!    Feels similar to the Wilson NCAA solution game ball, but slightly less tacky, but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber.  I personally do not like that.  This ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box, without a break in period.  Well, i hope it gets to feeling better over time, but since it supposedly has not break in period, i am very skeptical.  I honestly do not feel the "crosstraxxion" design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball.  If you like the feel of leather, this is NOT for you.  I am NOT impressed!  Search for reviews for this ball before purchasing!  The only thing you can do with this ball that you can't do with others, is say "Well at least this is the Official Game Ball the pros use!"	0
B000F5IHL4:amazon_gave_me_a_refund:sankar_l	I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture.	0

I sent it back yesterday and hopefully that is the case. But i would steer clear if i was you	0
B000CCEVGU:not_so_great.:t._hogarth_"buy.com_boy"	Well, they looked so cool on TV that I ordered 2 of them and I regret it. It's awkward to get the hook back into the "rocket" once the bait is on. I took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun/rod. We left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current. I've come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money. If you're going to take a little one out fishing, just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because it was a neat IDEA. [...]	0
B0006VWRYK:worthless:liora_hess	I thought this was great at first until I realized that it works sporadically. I can get up in the morning and walk all over the house, look down and check my Sportline to find it is still registered at 0 steps. Other times I can walk a mile or more and find it recorded maybe 20 steps. One of the problems with it is its shape. Unlike some pedometers (like Omron) that are a vertical oval-shape, the Sportline is a horizontal rectangle, which makes it easily roll with the waistline of your pants or skirt. It's important for a pedometer to be perpendicular to the ground for it to record accurately. After much frustration, I finally bought an Omron pedometer which I love. Unfortunately, this Sportline model is so inconsistent and inaccurate as to be useless.	0

B0007ZCIUI:turn_back_now_!!!__don't_buy_from_joe_brands!:d._degraw	We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.  IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY!	0

B000EGSGJM:ehh_-_its_okay:denise_m._degennaro	This tent is alright. Its not very sturdy and they sent me the wrong parts.

B000BSW9ZA:well_made:w._spain	This radio has a very good rich sound for such a small speaker.  The 1 bulb LED flashlight is brighter than I thought it would be.  The rubberized case is solid and durable.  Two minutes of cranking has consistently provided 45 minutes of play time at average volume.  There are 3 big drawbacks.  1. The tuning knob is very small and next to impossible to read.  2. The crank handle is the smallest I've seen and feels like it will break easily.  3. The worst feature is the on/off switch for the flashlight. It is a "push" round button mounted on the side that keeps turning itself on when you hold the radio or pick it up.  They should have used a "slide" switch and put it in a different area	0
B0009VTTG6:pitching_the_tent?_extremely_serious_challenge_cage_net_to_put_together:bryan_l._tooley	it was the best price around and when it finally showed up at my door i couldn't wait to put it together until it was harder than it looked. you should use more than one person to put it together maybe it was my fault but the net was not fast nor easy to set up, just like the box says it was a challenge. Extremely! I would not recommend this product for someone who has no time nor patience for an hour long set up process. I do recommend anything that folds up quick and pops up into position. But the extreme deal would be an actual 10x10x10 cage you could get online for less than 500$. You might have to spend the money but to not have to deal with the headaches over and over again putting this together is well worth it. find your self an area out side and build your real cage and enjoy it all year long. The nets are not worth the time nor the money, balls still fly up out of the net, you have to be really close and the fabric is just like a tent. with as much force as im hitting the balls with it wont be long till the material is damaged. Dont waste your money even if you do get it for 60 bucks. The wind will always win, once it catches sail it tumbles like sage grass. Get Bigger Better Deals with the real Cage	0
B000EYE5OO:uh..._no:a._golomski	This seems to be a pretty low-quality item.  I love Zelda, for certain.  But, it seems that it is more of a toy sword than a replica of any kind. Unless I missed something and Link's sword really did have a plastic handle	0
B000FKALZE:cheaply_made:marina_alexander_"eds"	Our three year old twins received two of these cars for Christmas.  The joystick control broke on one of the cars one hour after they received them on Christmas Day!  My husband ordered a replacement car and then shortly after that, the other cars' joystick control broke!  So, now we are stuck with TWO BROKEN CARS and one that does work, but are wondering when that one will break too!  I need to mention that the kids were NOT particularly rough with the cars; we were right there when the other car broke and did not witness any rough behavior.  The controls are cheap and will break eventually.  The cars are very loud, but on the positive side, the kids do love them and provide fun and entertainment for them.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product	0

You can push yourself a bit further at the gym.  The gassiness and stomach discomfort are what cause me to not recommend this product.  It wasn't so good or effective that the side effects were worth it.  I had no lasting weight loss when taking it, just lost 3 lbs the first 2 days taking it which climbed back on a day later.  I'd skip it	0

However, in mid January it started to sound as if the batteries were dying and then it just quit. I replaced the batteries but to my disappointment it still wouldn't work. I tried different batteries again just to be sure and still nothing. I had a very hard time finding out how to contact imaginarium.com and finally just emailed amazon. They responded quickly and it appears that I will be able to return the toy and my son liked it enough that I may take my chances and buy it again.

I had this for about ten minutes before i thought that i got 13 dollars ript off. it fell apart after 1 hour. it couldnt shoot after 5 minutes.Dont get this gun cause it isnt just mine its the way its made. those othe reviews are people who probly dont ever use it and probly never have used it	0

B000C9JSJI:junk:charlene_m._indelicato	This is the second Nike watch I ordered. The first one did not work and Isent it back to Amazon. Amazon was great and sent me new one. This one worked for a few days. I then had the battery replaced . Two weeks after it stopped working. By that time I had thrown out the box etc and now it is sitting in the basket in my kitchen. I have hopes to return it but it seems to much of a problem to explain. I am am glad I have had this opportunity to vent.	0
B0000BYNAQ:this_thing_$#@ks!!!__do_not_buy!!!:scott_limeberry_"scottlimeberry"	I got this POS for Christmas because I was excited by the ad, the concept, and Natalie Gulbis.  It' a neat idea and I love gadgets.  Upon removing it from the box it looks and feels cheap, like a happy meal toy cell phone.  Cheap plastic and a poor LCD screen.  If that were it, I could live with it, but I can not get this thing to connect to the website to down load the necessary software.  I have been trying all day, from different computers, and still nothing.  I call the support number, sit on hold for about fifteen minutes and then it just hangs up on you.  This is a fairly expensive toy.  You would think SkyGolf would spens a little less money on advertising and a little more on R& D.  This thing is junk.  Stick with a Bushnell 1500 PinSeeker instead.  Traditional rangefinder, but it works great.  Nothing to crash, no support needed, and IT WORKS!!!  I am sending this expensive piece of junk back first t hing tomorrow.  The sad thing is, SkyGolf is destroying its image and reputation.  If they had put a little more effort into their development, and actually had someone there to answer the phones, this could have been a really nead golf tool that people wouldn't mind paying for.  The annual $20 membership fee is no problem, if it works.  Right now, I wouldn't pay $20 for the unit its self, let alone the membership.  Don't waste your money on this... well, I was going to call it an expensive paper weight, but it wouldn't even work for that... it weighs about as much as a sheet of card stock.	0

B0007ZF5NA:poor_handle_design:t._coogle	My Mom wrecked badly on this the first time out, due to the difficult-to-control steering.  Very awkward handle bars...several of us tried to ride it.

B000BFR6HE:beware_of_master_replicas:al_magliochetti	I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.	0
B000ODZC9C:dangerous:donna_r._marsh	The handle bars keep loosening up which in turn makes it very dangerous.  Also, the base metal footboard is cracking.  I wouldn't spend the money on this scooter.  It's not worth it.  Spend your money on a cheaper model Razor.	0

B000EI2O4I:disappointing:denise_m._dion	The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction.  However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company.  I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time	0

Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop	0

B000FBM296:defective_item_and_poor_customer_service:b._landau	This waterproof fanny pack is not waterproof. We tried it on two separate occasions, both times fully closing each seal, but water leaked through anyway, soaking the contents. When I tried to return the item, the seller refused to accept it, claiming that its own tests showed it was working properly. Despite what the company now says, the fact is that the item was defective. I see from the other reviews that this is not an isolated problem, and the fact that the merchant refuses to honor its return policy means that customers should be very wary of doing business with this company	0
B000A2JW48:great_look,_nice_frame,_dissapointing_ride:grl	I wanted a bike to ride around on unpaved trails on my few acres in the country.  This retro designed, one speed, steel framed, coaster braked, comfort  bike seemed to be the ideal choice.  When it arrived, I pulled out the tool box and set to work assembling it.  The first frustration was that the instructions for assembling this bike are NOT included in the manual (which seems to cover every bike but this one). How hard could it be to write up instructions (with tool specifications)for EACH model they manufacture?  A one page flyer could have done the trick. To further complicate  matters, some of the models in the manual are assembled using metric tools and others call for standard sizes.	0
B00074TAWI:nice_idea_poorly_made.:the_mountain_man	I bought this gloves so I wouldn't have to wrap my hands to protect my wrists everytime I went for a bag workout. One reviewer is clearly confused. They said that there was a metal bar in the glove to prevent fatigue in your hand. Turns out there is no metal bar in it, but instead it was plastic or something similar. Then when using these gloves on my 100 pound punching bag I wound up with blood blisters all over my knuckles. This has never happened to me before and I have been working out with punching bags for over 15 years. Yeah sure you might get some skin torn off from your hands rubbing on the inside of the leather everlast gloves the first couple weeks you use them but blood blisters on your knuckles after your knuckles are use to those kinds of blows for years. Another thing I noticed about these gloves is they wear out fast if you constantly use them on punching bags. They get to the point to where you feel like there is no padding in them. Gave these gloves 2 stars since I liked the idea of being able to wrap these gloves on and go to work. But they need to be greatly improved upon.	0
B000CRV2GC:not_the_real_ddr...:heather_tenney	My husband bought me this for Christmas, and we were both disappointed.  The graphics are awful, some give me a headache.  The songs are awful--they all sound alike.  Its the kind of thing you can do on a cheap keyboard.  The pad loses any sort of sensitivity very quickly.  I've had it two weeks, and already I'm hitting the arrows but its registering a miss.  I gave it two stars because my kids (ages 6 and 2) love it, but then again, they don't know any better.  I am using it to get better at DDR, but then I will invest in a better pad and game.	0

B000C3U9L0:reviews_were_good_until_i_bought_it.:b._burke	I bought this pedometer when the ratings for it were 5 stars!  Now there are all kinds of bad reviews starting in 2007.  Too bad I bought it in December.  This is a piece of junk.  I thought I was ordering a mid-priced pedometer.  (It was $12 at that time).  I agree about it not staying on, and even though I followed the calibration instructions, the steps were never accurate.  I had an additional problem in that parts of the numbers were missing on the LCD most of the time.  So is a backwards three actually an eight, was that a one or a seven, is that 5000 or 6000?  I never knew.  The only time all the lines displayed making perfect numbers was when you cleared it to 0000.  I'll probably try a 'cheapy' from Walmart.  It will probably do better than this.	0

B000AYF9PM:worthless:alvaro_rodriguez	I car camp around 6 weeks a year. Every night on a different spot. I was looking for a light and sturdy table. Easy to setup and easy to pack. This table is not the right table for me. Yes it's light. That's the only good atribute I can find for this table. It's cumbersome to setup. The plastic tabs that hold it together are very fragile. The end caps on the ribs of the top surface started falling off even before the table was assembled. It's low to the ground. I would not buy this table again, nor I would recommend anyone to buy it. I give it one star because I can't give it any lower.	0
B000BB6MCS:didn't_work_at_all:isis	I ordered this knowing that it would have its limitations, but I expected it to project sound at least a short distance. When we tried it out all we got was feedback. Words were not audible at all. When I contacted the seller I was told it was a novelty item only, which I think is a ridiculous answer, since even a novelty item should work a little... Maybe the one we got was broken. I didn't try again, since the seller didn't seem to think anything was wrong with it when I called, and the shipping, which was not refunded when I returned it, was just too expensive to have nothing to show for in the end	0

B00074USP6:another_piece_of_junk_pair_of_goggles...:spock	These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these.	0
B000KMRB7S:these_are_only_for_flat,_smooth_surfaces!:c._baur_"mdb"	Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court.	0
B000HDDFFW:waste_of_money!:brad_hutchinson	i bought this bike(in the mermaid ariel theme)for my 2 year old daughter. the manufactor's age for this bike is 1 1/2 year and up. this bike is awful. the seat is set up like it would be on a normal bike BUT, the pedals are attached to the FRONT wheel like a tricyle- which make it IMPOSSIBLE for a child to reach the pedals while sitting on the seat. my 4 year old son can reach the pedals but, he even has a hard time riding it. its truly a waste of money and if i could find the receipt, i would take it back! it was a huge disappointment-as a Christmas gift. Whoever designed this bike did not have a child in mind. there is no way a child could ride this bike comfortably even if they could reach the pedals	0
B0009JQTVQ:maybe_for_a_couch_potato...:overripepuntec_"online_shopping_saved_my_life."	This machine is too easy. Even with the additional resistance bands, it's just not enough if you're an active person at all. The assisted crunch funtion is a joke and most of the moves are just as effective without the machine. I used it every day for a month (until I felt I'd gotten my money's worth) & now it collects dust. I'd sell it for $20 at this point just to get it out of my house. I see my Easy Shaper becoming a Goodwill donation in the very near future	0
B000BXJ0F2:good_product,_but_far_too_small:s._weber	We bought and then returned the Scuttle Bug.  It was well made and easy to snap together.  However, it was far, far too small for our 27 months old daughter - who happens to be very petite (only 25 percentile for height and weight). Her knees dragged the ground.  I think it is a cool product, but maybe for younger/smaller children.  We wound up getting a kiddio trike which is fantastic!!	0
B0009PVUVO:poor_quality_control_and_rust!:sj	I was attracted to the Park & Sun PB-PRO Pitchback Pro because of the large dimensions of the tubing and the hinge assembly that would allow me to easily fold the unit and place it in my garage.

B000A1FCNE:don't_overuse_it:f._buchanan	My son hit .515 as an 8 year old last year.  This year, he moved up a division and has struggled at around .250, even though he has a fairly nice swing.  Using this device for two weeks, he suddenly can't hit anything.  I pitched him hardballs today and he swung over the top of every one of the first 60!  The problem with this device is that the ball doesn't drop like a pitched ball, so it actually trains them to swing higher than normal.  I'll be putting this away for the season and trying to recover my son's swing and confidence.  Don't get me wrong, the kids love it.  The entire team lines up before every game and begs you to throw fastballs with it.  It's great for use around the house - just tie it to a tree and you can take swings that you couldn't otherwise.  Beware if you intend to use this for much more than casual practice and don't let it replace live pitching.  Fun-factor is a 5, but as far as a training device, I have to question its value	0

B00074T41U:quality_control_now_that_great.:midwest_guy_"midwest_guy"	On my third pair since I purchased these gloves from Amazon a few weeks ago. First pair had Velcro on the inside sewn into the seam. Very irritating, especially when holding heavy weights and having the rough Velcro dig into the palm of your hand. Medium size was smaller than advertised, shutting off the circulation to my fingers and the non slip pads on fingers were ripping off after 1 week of use! Harbinger customer service was very helpful, and sent me out a new, larger pair for free (had to return mine first). This pair shows up, and the gloves are two different colors! Blue and gray on one and blue and black on the other. Strike two for quality control! Waiting for a 3rd matching pair from Harbinger. Again, Harbinger customer service is excellent, but the quality control of these gloves is less than average	0

Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs, steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall, museum, park, or on city streets.	0
B000IKX5IG:ab_chair:lamontica_d._alexander	I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it!	0
B0001BW0RO:this_table_is_very_flimsy_and_overpriced:linda	I don't think I have ever run across a more overpriced, flimsy piece of camping gear; and for this very poorly engineered and built table to actually come from Coleman was rather a shock.  The first time I opened the box containing this table was while setting up the camp site.  Too late: the table was so delicate that the main parts that hold it together -- the leg anchors that support the equally flimsy and fragile aluminum cross pieces -- had been broken in the simple act of shipping.  I looked closer, and these main supports were made of some incredibly cheap, delicate plastic.  This thing wouldn't have lasted a day on a campsite, even if it had survived shipping!  (We placed the table in the campsite's trash dumper the next morning). Buy a lower cost table from another company -- no need to even go to a higher priced unit, since anything else would be better designed and constructed than this table.	0

B000LIQLUE:flakey:all_paws	I've been using this mat for a little over a month, for a 5 day-a-week practice. At first I was thrilled, but at the end of my 2nd class, I noticed it was looking a little rough where I placed my feet. It's continued to get worse and worse, 100s of little pieces of mat come off during practice, and scatter on the floor around me. Since I practice in a studio, it's particularly annoying. I practice with the "sticky" side down, and the jute side up. The jute side is the side that flakes. Practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem, but then the mat inchworms across the floor.	0

I send it to Suunto Finland for repair and they say that it leaked from the housing and "kindly" offered a repair for 140 Euros.	0

B000AAYBLY:the_worst_pump_ever_-:deniz15	IT is amazing to me how something like this could even be approved for the market - This pump is 100% JUNK.  SO Bad, that I am finding my self actually writing a review about a bicycle pump.  The instructions were a disaster.... and why would I need to look at instructions for a pump? - Well, that is because it does not work, and I mean does not work at all!  The lever on the side is a total gimmick (does nothing as the previous review states).  Save your money here - Do NOT buy this pump.	0
B000C05ZHG:neat_idea_but_uncomfortable:t._machida_"lost_boy"	Scary looking but inpractical.  The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already (if your fists are that big you don't need claws).  The talon shaped blades are sharp but can't dig in, they can only scratch.  They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard.  Nice wall decor but nothing more	0
B0006VWRZ4:good_idea,_poor_execution.:jane_public	I have used pedometers for a few years. I was initially impressed with this pedometer BUT then I discovered the 360 I received did not always 'wake' and keep track of steps. The 360 I received did not always count steps even when already 'awake.' The 'sleep' 'wake' feature is bogus, it does not work and it makes this pedometer a loser. I would not be surprised if other users of this pedometer have simply overlooked the fact that their steps might not be getting counted because the pedometer is stuck in sleep. Heartrate Monitors, the company I bought it from was not responsive when I asked for guidance. I bought another pedometer from a different dealer, the Sportline 345 - It's my second 345, need I say more	0

B000MB5I36:what's_going_on_with_leatherman's_these_days?:chris_lee_"krazyboi"	I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new...	0

The gear shifters were not adjusted properly and shifting would often result in the chain jumping back and forth.	0

This machine is a joke. If you cannot get your legs over your head then MAYBE this machine is for you. But this is NOT for serious users who stretch everyday. I can do more with my $5 stretch band from Target than I can with this big heavy space-taking piece of junk. The resistance is zero, and just laughable over all. Save yourself the money, and frustration - buy a lightweight no-hassle stretch band!	0
B000F4H74I:eh:dani_arteri	I got this because it was cheap at K-Mart, and thank goodness I can return it. The ball is really small--I love how they omit the size from all of their information. I didn't pump it up with the pump, so I don't know how good that is (I used an air compressor)...the other equipment isn't too bad, but I was really getting this for the ball, which just so happens to be a piece of poopola. I wouldn't suggest getting this	0
B0007YGIMI:cheap,_cheap,_cheap:a.w.	This pedometer is so cheap it isn't worth the $1.88 pricetag.  Unless you want to cheat yourself, this is not the pedomter for you.  You gain 20 steps just putting it on your pants, then walking to my co-workers desk five steps from mine I gained about 30 steps.  By the end of my work day I had apparently walked 11,953 steps that I mostly acquired turning in my office chair, and I won't even go on to say how many steps you gain driving in your car.  On top of all this, the company wouldn't refund me on the pedometers I ordered for my co-workers	0
B000BSY19W:no_light_whatsoever:danielle_netherland	I should have read the previous review before ordering, because this product did not work at all.  The on/off button did not work/click.

B00004W1TQ:net_reduces_tramp_size:r._rhodes_"rhodesmg"	We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure.  As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs, it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square.  We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of "caves in".  We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs	0

B000FV8V28:you_get_what_you_pay_for:r._whitehead	I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you.	0
B0007YGCWY:stiff_finger_holes...painful:mtn_mann_"mtnmann"	I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff	0
B000G3E228:no_hot_import_toys!!!:barbara_russell_"soft_like_air"	Do not buy this gun from Hot Import Toys. That is my main point. It took a very long time to get to me (8 days) and when it did, it was broken. Not that it was shattered or it was jammed. It just didn't work. The piston seemed to be fine, the motor seemed to be connected, the gearbox seemed to be in tact, the batter (although a little hard to install) was charged, and the trigger was connected to the gear box. I thought that I could return it for either a working gun or just a refund. No. I e-mailed HIT over 7 times over the course of a couple weeks. Nothing! I got no response, no notification, nothing. I continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post a phone number to reach them at on their site! HIT is the worst company to buy from ever! From what i see and know, this gun seems to be quite the MPEG! I would have loved to use it to its fullest with my friends but unfortunately, I bet you anyhting that HIT will decide to wait until the 30 day warranty has expired before they e-mail me back: telling me of how the warranty time is up and that they aren't allowed to exchange my product. BUY FROM AIRSPLAT!!! Trust me. This is a good gun. Fast, accurate, good looking. Do not waste a month of your time waiting for it to arrive, having to find its broke, waiting for them to e-mail you back, and then have to live with a broken, useless piece of potential Airsoft gun. So trust me, don't buy from Hot Import Toys	0
B000GI0SI0:didn't_work_or_hold_up_well:k._denehy	I purchased these so I wouldn't slip on my sticky mat when my hands sweat.  However, they didn't work well for this purpose because there is only one elastic strip that goes between your first and second finger and it allows your hands to slip right through the yoga paws.  Additionally, after only a few classes, the sticky material started coming off of the yoga paws, particularly on the foot paws.  I guess they would be okay for someone who doesn't ever have sweaty palms and who doesn't do any intense postures.  Otherwise, I would recommend doing what I do now - use a pair of weight lifting gloves with a leather/suede palm for extra traction on your sticky mat	0
B000KEXLAC:worst_customer_service_in_the_world:steven_clark	We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!	0
B000B43JI0:not_food:s._hunter_"reikiusui3"	Read the ingredients. Contains refined flour and sugar, hydrogenated oil, corn syrup, and artificial colors.

Always read the labels and be sure that the product is safe for YOU	0
B000AO5ITO:a_real_puzzle:cherokee_"barbara"	This is a nice heavy item, perfect for covering your trike.  But I have yet to figure out how to put it in place.

B000MT8XSU:arrival_took_15_days:les_paul_"coffee_man"	The item was packaged well, but it took over 15 days at normal shipping rate.  The lighter for it stopped working 15 minutes after it was opened. Anyone want the rest of this can? What a waste of time	0

B0006HJRK6:cramping:unsatisfied_"unsatisfied"	I take yoga in a gym.  The class starts as the aerobics session ends.  I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class.   Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot.  I expected more elastic.  They made my foot cramp during the class.  Because I had worn them once I could not return them.  Now I do not know what to do with them.  I should throw them out but I spent money on them	0
B00005KAPW:p.o.s.:not_so	Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10 swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness	0
B000J2CSRM:good__for_a_week:m._sinclair	Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable	0

B000DENDU2:do_not_buy_from_weslo:s._turnbow	DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked	0

B000JF20LI:smooth_beginning,_then_horrible_squeeking_starts:k._bhadriraju	I was impressed by all the reviews that said that how quiet the machine was when I bought it.  Assembly was not so bad (2.5 hours).  Then the squeeking started.  Just about after 100 calories burned, there would be a two distinct squeeks at a specific position of the flywheel.  We called technical service and the service person called back on the 5th day (he needed to respond before 5 days) and scheduled a visit for a day 10 days AFTER that.  The technician inspected the machine and said that such sound was normal, and adjusted the tension on some screws and left.  Now the squeeking is starts right after beginning the workout.  It is LOUD.  As in, you need earplugs, loud.  Another call to tech support...	0

B000ARKYWW:misleading.....:themasterofdisaster	Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy	0

B0007Y5MK2:don't_waist_your_money.:sherry_nadeau	The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product	0
B0006N07YU:ummmm.....:scott_toomey_"jobber_extraordinaire"	I might be an idiot, but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on! Haha.

Again....maybe I'm just an idiot....	0
B0006U67H4:too_big,_too_heavy:m.lee_"kess"	This is not as described..it is very hard to move - heavy and bulky. If you have a place to set it up and leave it, fine, but this is not going to be pulled out every day for a 'stroll in front of the TV', as described.  Performance-wise it seems very nice and is a good solid piece of equipment, but definitely not an item that can be put away after each use.  I'm disappointed	0
B000J142AO:choose_another_product:want_of_pain_relief_"gd"	Prior to purchasing this item, I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe.  I wish I heeded this advice because, on top of fasciitis, I developed severe toe pain by using this product.  I then had to by a second product anyway that, thankfully, eliminated the toe pain.  Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead	0
B000637LTY:flashlight:uncle_sam_"uncle_sam"	Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one	0
B00081RE5U:the_rubic's_cube_of__shelters:steve	If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.	0

B000EI06KM:even_at_a_discount_price_not_worth_the_money:adling_clan	We have in the past owned an In Step single jogger.  It wasn't perfect but it certainly met our needs.  It always needed to be tipped back to change direction and it rusted a little because we left it outside.  If we had stayed as an only child family it would have continued working but with the addition of another baby we decided to sell it.  After being in transition for over a year and now that the weather is warming up we decided to get a double jogger for strolling.  We purchased the In Step Run Around LTD 2 Jogging Stroller in hopes it would meet our new needs.  The problems of the single stroller seemed compounded in the double stroller.  My husband had no problem getting it together but complained about the cheap caliper style break... it doesn't stop the stroller and barely even slows it down.  It took him the same amount of time to work on the break as it took him to assemble the whole jogger.  After that we placed our three year old and our 18 month old in it for a test ride.  When placing them in we encountered our next problem... the seats even at the highest point are super reclined.  They wanted no part of laying back but instead were both utterly thrilled to sit far forward and mess with each other. As for the straps a six inch long safety label sewn to the webbing made it almost impossible to thread them through the front buckle. So off we set on our test drive.  It was really hard to push and almost impossible to turn.  After a while we figured out that letting the kids sit so far forward threw off the balance of the whole jogger.  The only way to make it partially work was to let out both seats to the fully reclined position, criss-cross the shoulder straps and constantly yell "Stay down kids...if you sit up one more time I'm going to sit in it and make you push me!"  Well we got home from our test run and my husband pulled out the cardboard box and with a resigned air began the job of taking it apart.  I don't recommend this item.  In all honesty our Radio Flyer Pathfinder Wagon does the job more effectivel	0

203276	I received this from my husband as a birthday present. It figures he was going to get something with the name 'IronMan'. =P I've only used it for a week, but I think we're going to have a long and happy relationship. (Tho' I've found my husband using it more then I am!) Its easy to fold up, which is important as I'm not the strongest woman in the world. But I leave it out as I know that if it's folded and put away I probably won't use it. However, this sucker looks so cool that I really have no desire to put it in the closet. Everything on it is convinent, with one exception. They made the display easy to see, but it blocks the TV! LOL. One star off for that... =	1
258602	My physician told me to exercise or else, so I looked at Comsumer Reports and listened to friends who spoke of a recumbent bike. Amazon's  price was great and I have been delighted. If you like to read and exercise, this one's for you	1
301330	Fantastic product--I am a group fitness instructor and I use this product everyday--I add a banana, peanut or cashew butter, plain yogurt, ice and water--this is in lieu of dinner--I don't get hungry and it really keeps my energy levels up	1
426024	I bought this mat for my exercise bike.  It was large and gave my floor great protection.  I would recommend this mat to anyone that has exercise equipment	1
436138	This is the first product I've ever bought to work out my forearm, so I can't compare it to anything else...but I will say it does work.  I've noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it.  It's comfortable and easy to use.  I would like the highest resistance to be a little harder, though	1
505633	On the basis of the first review here, I ordered this bike and couldn't be happier with it.  This is the first piece of exercise equipment I've ever tried that is worth the space it takes up. I use it every day	1
538019	My box arrived somewhat banged up, but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar, it was OK. BUT, after 2 days I started hearing a noise, seemed to come from the interior of the pedals/gearbox, sounded like a loose object bouncing around. I was afraid I would have to ship it back. I called Schwinn, and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if I could reproduce the sound. I assured her, it was not the pedals. She said, "yes sir, now please take the pedals off".  I did, and, it was the left pedal! Sounded just like the interior. Anyway, they will send me new pedals, so problem solved. Sounds like they have encountered this problem before.	1
565427	It had special meaning for me, because when my two daughters were little (they are now in their late 30s), I taught them to flush finally by telling them there was a toilet monster that would come out and get them if they didn't flush.  I caught them both with the Toilet Monster joke and it was quite funny and led to some fond reminiscences.	1
602277	This flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense. This is meant to be an EMERGENCY flashlight and if you use it as such, it is great. This is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn't meant to be. But when you need some light in an emergency, a little shaking and you have some light. It's starting to dim? Just shake it some more and voila, more light. You could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help.	1
B000CEK036:great_bike:tina_bailey	I BOUGHT THIS BIKE FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS AND HE LOVES IT!  NO PROBLEMS WITH IT SO FAR, IT IS BUILT WELL AND THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.	1
B000EQCW88:this_shade_tent_is_the_best:jack_keener	We bought this tent to travel with our newborn to the beach and it is amazing. the setup is quick and we are the envy of all beachgoers. It is lightweight and well constructed. I highly recommend this to all who desire shade and comfort	1
B0006U67G0:why_pay_more:best_buyer_"bb"	This is a fantastic product at an incredible price. I am amazed by the quality and the free shipping makes it even better. It has completely eliminated my lower back pain, the chiropractor never did that. Buy this table	1
B000CSBLYY:love_it!_love_it!_love_it!:d._reish_"thought_addict"	My table was shipped on a Thursday and at my house the next day!!!  As someone mentioned, the directions make it seem more difficult to assemble than it is.  There aren't that many parts to put together.	1
B0007IS73C:great_product_at_good_price:veronica_m._neely	I purchased the Valeo 10lb medicine ball for my son who is training for basketball. This ball has a very durable rubber covering and has some bounce to it.  This ball also has the same bumpy grips and dividing lines like a basketball.  Plus it is the same size of an official size men's basketball.  Color is also very nice	1
B0001VO1YY:great_bike_rack:allen_k._davis	This rack works perfect for me. It as easy to assemble and its easy to use. It folds up to put in the corner of the garage when not in use. My bikes have curved cross bars, so this mounting style was my only option, and it works great	1
B000KMHV8W:nice_ninja_weapon:neil_r._meislin	It's an ok knife. That picture of it can trick you. If you look at the middle of the page, it says "we ship black if we are out of silver". Don't get me wrong, black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green. The odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery, so I hope you like black weapons. The tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley. Just try not to poke an eye out. When will you need a LED light on a sword??? Unless your fighting ninjas in the dark. Do you know why this weapon is so cheap? I think that it's shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive. Just don't challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine. P.S. If you're looking at my account name, I am not neil meislin but I am related to him.	1
B00074H8A4:lots_of_cushion:jennifer_m._hilton	The yoga studio where I take classes has a very hard floor and I have bunion problems.  This mat is the solution.  There is only one downside to this mat: standing one legged balancing sequences are alot harder with this mat.  However, since I take 3 power classes a week and 4 ballet classes a week I like the challenge.  The upside is you don't have to worry about putting a towel under your knee or anywhere because the mat is to thick.  I did place a skidless towel on it and it does move around quite a bit so I would not recommend using a towel over this mat it just won't stay in place. I will take the not so bad with the overwhelming good with this super squishy mat	1
B0007QCOEC:attractive,_dependable,_and_useful_to_keep_in_your_glovebox,_as_well_as_a_pocket_or_purse.:j._manly_"healthychoices"	This knife's single blade, a bottle opener, nail file, and two flat-head screwdrivers (one large, one small) come packed in a slimline aluminum case. There's a can opener, too--though I've never tried to use it--and a panel on one side that can be engraved. It's an elegant package and lightweight. Once you're used to this little buddy, you won't want to carry the standard red plastic version.	1
B000C17M26:fits_"almost"_all_helmets:jack_r._shaw	The mirror and its attachment is better than the ones I have purchased, however, the attachment does not addapt to all helmets. I have two helmets by Specialized: one I had no problem attaching to, the other, the helmet bindings were in the way and could not get the mirror attachment to fit properly. It would be to your advantage to research and design the mirror attachment to fit all helmets. This would help the buyer from purchasing a new helmet just to fit the mirror attachment. Whether or not you print this review does not matter to me. This review is intended for your design department. Thanks for the mirror	1
B0000WZYF4:good_product_at_a_cheap_price:a._mendoza_"fremont_rider"	I was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy.  I need a cargo box that I can put up alone on top the Acura MDX-just the right size.  The box was easy to assemble - less than an hour.  It is also easy to attach to the vehicle.  The box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver MDX.	1
B0007YGB48:good_price,_great_product:d._bennett	I found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of MTB glove, 30-40 dollars. No offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors, but please! I did some research on the web, and the Harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources. The price was a fourth of the competitors, so I thought why not try them out.	1
B000GFD9FC:magazine_for_m4_m16_(m83_only)_airsoft_electric_gun:alex_gamarra	great. if you need more mags, get this, it fits perfect.	1
B000E130FW:execelent_inexpensive_bike:stephen_c._endicott_"sce"	I purchased this bike for my wife It is an execelent product for the money it is very sturdy, easy to assemble (as long as your a little mechanically inclined). Its true if your less than 5'2" you will need pillows to get close enough to the pedals Im 6'2" and there is still room to move the seat back. Product arrived ahead of schudle and in good shape. My folks purchased a bike for $1200 yes it is nicer (the preset programs and overall looks)but not by much. I would buy this again if I needed to. Negatives- screen hard to read for shorter people. and you have to plug it in to a wall outlet.	1
B000B8JDSQ:works_great_but_doesn't_come_with_file_holder.....:eliza_anne_ohmin_"vvelizavv"	...so make sure you have one or you will be doing this all by hand, not to safe. Missing file holder is the only reason I don't give it five stars	1
B00005YVRN:soothing!:rif	This product is wonderful!  It sure helps my son rest comfortably with a variety of music.  We received this when he was a newborn and he is now 2.5 years old and still loves it.  We keep it right next to his twin bed so he can turn it on whenever he wants and since he knows how to change the music he is in control of what he wants to hear.	1
B0000AQKGG:little_league:sherelle_d._bedford	I ordered this for My daughter when she played t-ball. She played on the cubs team and it was great. Very durable, and adjustable	1
B000DZM3O8:great_bike_for_a_great_price!:happy_camper_"courtney_b"	What a beautiful bicycle!! I thought it was black and white from the photo but it's a really lovely forest green and white. It was really easy to put together myself.  My husband is really excited about it. He's pretty tall and this bike is more comfortable size for him than his last cruiser.  Very happy with this purchase! Great price too!  My own Schwinn cruiser came from a local shop and was twice as much.	1
B000067Q0P:38"_mini_band_trampoline:ivette_maldonado	the trampoline itself is very hard and good condition for its size.	1
B000GF7CPK:great_fun!:a._o'quinn	We bought this for our 2 year old on his birthday. He loves it! His older brother (3 1/2) has the regular Razor scooter, but that was too difficult for our 2 year old to use as it does not stand up by itself. This kiddie scooter is more balanced and as a result our son can keep up with his older brother. Good for the younger kids, but it does not go as fast as the regular Razor. As a result he will most likely grow out of it in a year or two. Definetly worth the money though. He just loves it!	1
B000F5NL0G:buy_it_for_the_foot_straps!:john_bigboot	The bad news first: The extension cables are VERY stiff, and they're shipped in a tight loop. Don't expect them to straighten out easily. And they don't come with extra clips to attach them to the foot straps. I just swap cables from whichever Bowflex station I'm not using and get a much better feel.	1
B0009LEJSY:great_to_add_to_collection:warcy	great condition...made a perfect gift for a friend collecting nfl footballs...and the dolphins are my team!! (she won't forget her gave her this one!) quick service...great packaging	1
B000CSKBBS:pyramid_retro-mechanical_bicycle_speedometer:paul_c._hodge_jr._"hodgie"	Very satisfied to find this speedometer available.  Perfect to put with my Schwinn Cruiser Deluxe 7.....had been searching for something like this for awhile. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for retro gear	1
B000MS3YH6:a_bit_surprised!:paul_j._lewis	I bought the X-Lander because I am a pilot and wanted a bit more information when I needed it. The watch is well designed and of good quality. A few things did disappoint me, but I think they are outweighed by the features, however.	1
B000G3E22I:great_gun!!!!:philip_hernandez	this gun shoots hard and fast!!!this is a metal gear box so it last forever!!!This is a must buy!!!believe me i know about airsoft guns and this is good!!	1
B000OE0S04:bumper_buggie_review:v._dimatteo	When the buggie arrived, it didn't work. I had to call Razor's Customer Service Dept. Their service is awful. The Senior Agent was very rude. I managed to figure out the problem on my own. The electrical unit was not connected. Once it was connected, it worked fine. We have two of them. The kids love them. They are lightweight and ride well on carpet. Overall, the product is good.	1
B00091RYHM:small_workout:kevin_j._egan_"nyc_blues"	This little device is easy to put together and easy to use.  Not for 'intensive' workouts however, you can pretty much use it anyplace you're sitting down.  That could mean even while the TV is on!  Like all exercise equipment, if you don't use it you lose it	1
B0000AS5JC:a_great_way_to_go_for_campground_cooking:jaci_rae_"jaci_rae__jaci_rae@www.jacirae.com_the_love_coach_and_christmas_expert"	A great multifunctional stove with lots of room.  Extremely functional with three burners and the side flaps helped keep the wind, dust, and other campground debris out of your food.  Propane is the only way to go when you're cooking in the wild Woods were doing some backwoods camping.  While the stove has lots of room for cooking it folds down nicely making it a great compact pack along.  A must-have for any camping trip	1
B000FA96NW:nice_toddler_helmet:l._bowen	I bought this helmet for my 3 year old.  He likes it, it seems to fit well, seems to adjust fairly easily, received good reviews from Consumer Reports.  The only thing I don't like about it is the chin straps seem to twist a little bit between the ears and chin.  My son hasn't complained about this being uncomfortable, but it looks like it might possibly be.  I can't see any way to straighten them out all the way from ears to chin, it's just the way they are attached to the helmet.  Generally though, I am very happy with it.	1
B000EI2O3Y:so_glad_i_bought_this_stroller....:d._reich	My daughter is 2 1/2 years old, 32 lbs. and I wanted to get back into jogging.  After reviewing many strollers I decided on this one for it's price and features (swivel front tire, rubber tires, tray for myself and my daughter-snacks and juice keep her from getting antsy on my runs).  I wasn't sure if she would be too big for a jogging stroller but she fits very comfortably in this one and hasn't complained during any of my runs.  It handles great too!!  My only complaint is that I have not found it as easy as other reviews say it is to fold up.  I have a SUV so it has not been a problem, but I must say for me it does not fold flat at all and I am not sure it would fit into a trunk. But, most reviews have have said it folds easy. Not sure what I am missing, but..	1
B000K7A7VK:fast_and_furious:d._martin_"kddavis1953"	Arrived just in time for the snow, my grandson who is 9 had loads of fun, however,it requires the user to have good balancing skills, like a skateboard. I would have given it a 5 star but it could have been faster had the plastic footing been a little thicker to eliminate the base from warping up in the middl	1
B000FH2Y9S:schwinn_roadster_trike:sandra_j._reiber	A quality product. Low to the ground so very hard for a little one to tip over. Easy to assemble. Can't wait for the snow to disappear so we can take it outside! Have been riding it inside, mostly using our legs (we're not yet 2 yrs old) to scoot around. However, our bigger cousin (just turned 5 yrs old) had a blast with it and could still peddle without grinding his knees into the handle bars. This trike will last a long time and thru many kids	1
B000FOOSIQ:surprising:w._grasmeder	I bought this bottle after reading a review that claimed it kept ice for 24 hours.  My girlfriend unwrapped the box on Christmas day, and filled it that afternoon.  It had ice still 2 days later.  Sturdy, effective, and comfortable to drink from.	1
B000B74E9U:finally,_a_skateboard_for_a_girl:j._burd	I purchased this skateboard for my 7-year old daughter.  Her older brother is into rollerskating and she wanted to share in his activities, however, she didn't like the "boy" skateboards.  She loves her new Barbie skateboard	1
B000EWKAKO:pretty_simple:bbeardb	Can't really go wrong here.  A metal post, some rubber grips, and a couple of wheels.  It works great, and was the cheapest I found.	1
B000J01GY0:excellent_producr:rick_i._steepin	My son was very happy with the product.. good quality and well worth the money.	1
B00024JUF0:simple_step_stool:richard_wiegman_"retired_aerospace"	This litle gadget has come in handy on a number of occasions.  It's collapsable, strong, light and easy to use.  I wish the price was under $[...], but the best price I could find was on Amazon.com and it's what my wife wanted and loves.  We also bought one each of these for our grown children and they use them constantly.  A GOOD PRODUCT!!	1
B000AM064S:wonderful_treat:yoga_girl	Treated myself to a yogitoes mat and I love it!  It's very absorbent (great for hot yoga) and very non-skid.  It allows me to focus on my practice rather than the distractions of slipping feet or hands.  Wonderful tool	1
B000ODZBG6:scooter:amanda_l._short_"amanda"	this is perfect! the purple is a dark purple and my girl loved it! there's no confusing this scooter with her sister's (which is pink). she loved it and can't wait to get it outside to ride all day. thanks	1
B000FDRQ1S:awesome_value:s._parsons	These are just as good as everyone says - smooth as silk and very quick. Just to give you an idea, I get a good 40-50 feet of travel from one push using these bearings. They really are the best value out there	1
B000BJEYVG:great_product,_great_price.__don't_pass_this_deal_up.:harry_popsicle_"goozman"	Short review:  This combo is an exceptional deal.  For the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool.  Alone the swiss army tool is over $30-35 bucks	1
B000C7LXOI:uhhh...:linda_williams_"airsoft_ace"	Typical Aegs shoot 280-310 and most fields that are moderated have a 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs is great if u wanna play by yourself or in a non official place.....i also sure hope that a sniper can shoot 500 being they are normally single shot.....theyre not in the same categlory so your not comparing apples and apples.... this is a very nice gun....it is expensive for the parts included and the functionality...this gun is defidently not a beginner gun so i only reccomend it for people who have owned 2 or more aegs previously (AEG-TM ICS ,CA, AIM M4,G&P,G&G,Ect...	1
B000BGI5CS:build_your_routine:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	If you can stick to a workout routine, this home gym is perfect for you.  After a bit of assembly, you'll be able to do all your exercises at home	1
B000BGI5CS:the_correct_machine_for_me!:loudboy	I got this a few years back, and it is a very important member of our household still! My wrist was smashed in an auto accident many years ago and i no longer have the ability to hold free weight above my neck... the possibilities are atrocious. With the bowflex if i let go for any reason the potential catastrophe is avoided.	1
B00076KX18:use_them_every_week:unwise_owl	they do not squeeze my ears and head and the diopters finally let me see well	1
B0008IVYIG:a_great_training_aid_but....:maraden_l._panjaitan	This is probably the most complete training aid that covers set up, swing plane, grip and tempo. However i still need video and PGA pro to correct my swing. Here is the fault that i found: i can snap the lower ball with flipping my left hand and coming steep on downswing. This is not a cure for all but it helps.	1
B0009ISQD6:great_bag...warm...versitle...light...durable:c._fletcher	The Eureka kids 30'grasshopper is an awesome sleeping bag, and a great value. We have two girls ages 6 and 8 who we purchased the sleeping bags for. On an week long camping trip in early spring twice the temperature dipped into the thirtys, and once into the low thirtys. Our girls stayed toasty warm and comfortable in their grashopper mummy bags. These bags also pack well, and have a good zipper. For the money these bags simply can't be beat.	1
B000CSCFFS:inversion_is_for_me.:david_e._nixon	I looked at several inversion tables before deciding on my Life Gear and have no regrets in buying it. I am 6'2" and weigh 220 lbs. and it performs beautifully for me. It is well built and the memory foam makes it comfortable to lay on. It was easy to assemble and took only a short time before I was using it.	1
B00076ZEF8:fantastic_item:jeffrey_a._davis_"great_stuff"	Great way to get rid of stress in the office.  Suction cup bottom works extremely well.	1
B00062L3NK:light_and_easy_to_manage:adam_rosenbaum_"author_of_'how_to_remember_not_to_forget'"	This inflatable kayak is functional and easy to transport given it's light wheight. Once inflated, it's easy to carry with just one arm when empty. It also has a very sturdy feel once it's completely inflated (I would recommend an electric pump that you can plug into your car battery charger).	1
B00076ZE80:more_than_i_expected:cole_wiehl	This kit also includes a speed bag!! The item description never mentions that.  Which is awesome, but I already ordered one because I thought this didn't have it.  However it is a small speed bag so keep that in mind.  The bag gloves are very "budget" just like they state. So I doubt they will last long.  The heavy bag is fully packed, so the box is about 70lbs.  Other than that this is an exceptionally good value esp. with the free shipping	1
B00074H8BI:great_cushioning:m._han_"fsgirl"	I am use to doing abs work and pilates on the carpet, but my carpeting did not have enough padding so I decided to order an exercise mat.  I a very please with my order.  I noticed the difference right away.  The cushioning it gives my lower back is awesome.	1
B000FA9U1A:must_have_large_hands:v._coker	IT IS A GREAT FOOTBALL BUT IS HARD TO GRIP IF YOU DON'T HAVE REAL LARGE HANDS AND IS SLIPPERY	1
B000I5LQ0K:great_addition_for_tent_camping.:g._d._winn_"epabear"	I've spent years camping with a bag of clothes half-strewn around my tent, so a new tent led me to check this out to see if I can stay organized.	1
B0009X2CSQ:very_cool_knives!:darkblue	Most "replica" type weapons in this price range are just made to sit pretty on a shelf or wall, not these. Made out a single piece of stainless steel, these are very solid knives. As the previous reviewers stated, these do come very dull, but a file, a sharpener and a couple of hours can fix that. Once sharpened these knives are very useable	1
B000F3GD4E:great_little_kitchen....:g.burns	This is a great little camp kitchen, just the right size without taking up a lot of room at the camp site. I have another camp kitchen bought from a well known outdoor supplier but it's massive in size and more suited for extended stays, the Guide Gear Camp Kitchen is perfect for weekend camping and shorter stays. It's compact both set up and in it's carrying bag, it'll take up hardly any space while traveling. Perfect size for a camp stove on the top table with a smaller propane or charcoal grill on the side table. The hanging pantry is strong and rugged with plenty of room to stock food, paper supplies, etc. This is a well thought out and designed kitchen and while compact has everything you'd need to enjoy the great outdoors. I highly recommend it...Buy it, try it.... You won't be dissapointed	1
B0001WOV5M:the_perfect_sharpening_system?:weekend_woodbutcher	As a hobbyist woodworker who works primarily with hand tools, I've had to learn how to put a razor edge on things like plane blades and chisels.  While I've managed to master that skill (can shave hair off my arm with these tools), putting a sharp edge on my kitchen knives has been a nightmare.  I've tried numerous methods, none of which has worked well.	1
B000N8O8HU:better_then_it_has_to_be:nathan_s._lynes_"apogee"	This review is for Nike T-90 Club Team (32 panels)	1
B000NUMZLE:helps_make_your_nalgene_usable...:e._j._sprecher	This is a quite good item.  I looked at a number or similar items on amazon and this one seemed caught my eye.  It certainly does make drinking from a nalgene or similar (mine is actually from a different maker, but of the same style) much easier.  My only qualms are that it is slightly expensive for a simple piece of plastic.  Also, it is a little irritating to have to take it out and replace it everytime you want to refill the bottle.  You can fill over it I suppose, but it reduces the flow rate so that you have to fill much more carefully and slowly which reduces one of the advantages of having a large mouth bottle.  I also kind of wish that there was an easier way to access the lip of the bottle than having to unscrew and rescrew the top each time, but that is a general issue with the bottles, not this lid.  But overall, a very useful purchase	1
B000GPNW5O:help:k._george	does this gun use 6mm or .12 and if i do use .12s will it damage the firing mechanisim	1
B00008Z7LY:comfortable_mat:s._strickland	I have had my fare share of yoga mats and this one rates as one of the best. The thickness (1/8 inch) is just perfect - not too thick so it's easily portable but thick enough to provide adequate cushioning. What I really like about this mat is that it has the right amount of stickiness and grip, in a word, it is comfortable.	1
B0006U64XQ:exceptional_equipment_for_the_money:._"just_another_customer"	The first thing that I thought was "this is a lot of equipment for the money".  It comes well wrapped and is easy to assemble.  Took me about an hour.  It's relatively sturdy, although there is some minor movement of the frame when changing exercises (eg, the frame will move slightly forward when moving from leg lifts to dips).  Overall, I do not see how they make money selling it this inexpensively based on the good quality of this machine.	1
B000J2CTZI:go_figure:amazonaddict_"amazonaddict"	I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season.  Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such.  This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera!	1
B000FZ4U56:seasense_aluminum_kayak_paddles:bonnie_vrchota	Very comfortable.  They may be just a tad too long for a shorter person.	1
B000E3Q1UQ:great!:z._young_"zuzi"	I bought this for my brother, he loved it! I was worried that it is a little big, but apparently fisherman have a lot of stuff :-)He said it was just right	1
B000687F18:very_cool_product:vrdumbos	This product generatesa lot of attention. I like this one very much and looks very cool and very handy. It is very small when compared with other products in the market for a similar kind. The bright red LED is kinda OK. Ball point pen is very handy, though the quality of the tip is not very good	1
B000BGJLBC:happy_soldier:larry_summons_"bmore-soldier"	I'm currently in Iraq and I ordered this bike, although it took a while to get it (not uncommon in a package that is 90 percent medal) I was happy when finally I recieved it. I had a little trouble putting the brakes on and warped the alumimum screws that hold the brakes cables to the levers. After my small mishap I was on my way riding in 30 mins or less. I've had the bike for about three months or more and it has stood up to all sorts of terrain and weather. During the summer tempertures can reach 130 during the day and I had no issues with paint or the mechanics period. Now its the winter season and tempertures drop down to 30 and it rains often; still no major damage or issues other than a little rust on the four screws holding the handle bars in place. I've taken this bike threw rocks, dirt, asphalt, and plenty of sand. After a quick spray with the hose and wipe with a dry rag the bike is just as glossy and bold as the day I took it out of the box. Overall I am very pleased with this bike and plan to bring it back to the States with me when my tour is up	1
B0009IK0W6:looks_nice,_good_quality:j._napodano_"vtnap"	Can't beat this cabinet for the price.	1
B0000DZFXZ:all_around_exercise_mat.:george_gordon	Expensive, but I use it for aerobic and occasional high impact exercises as well as yoga. Very satisfied	1
B0007ZF5NA:great_bike:p._wakefield	By wife and I bought both the men and womens model.  They were a great buy, arrived on time and were easy to assemble. They're comfortable to ride and seem to be well built.  Enjoy.	1
B000ODZC9C:razor_a#_kick_scooter_kicks_"a--s!":john_b._dittmeier_"piggly_wiggly"	Purchased for a Christmas gift. The larger wheels and stronger construction was just what my son needed. He had the orignial A scooter for several years but is now a teen and was in need of a new razor with stronger construction. He was also wanting the wheely "kick" bar over the back wheel. Overall, the A3 gave him everything he needed to continue enjoying "the Razor." Kick stand would have been a nice addition to this model but no big sweat..can just be one more thing to break in my opinion.  Price on Amazon couldn't be beat. Price was by far the best from a host of on line sites I checked. Shipping was great deal and came quickly, within 3 or 4 days after ordering it just a week before Christmas! In the word of my son "Santa be very very good to me!	1
B000EI2O4I:excellent_stroller:marc_p._howard	We bought this stroller not only for jogging but also to use at places like Disneyland.  The swivel wheel makes this stroller the easiest thing to steer and our kids love it.  Our kids our three and one, both fit in the stroller comfortably.  The only draw back to the stroller is it does not have a cup holder for the parents	1
B000L9TVNW:great_scooter:anthony_dodge_"theartfuldodger"	what are you waiting for? quite reading my review and get this great scooter	1
B000J09V4C:top_of_the_line:danoon	This is the best wind up light you're going to find. I advise everyone to get one for that unexpected event. Our power goes out about twice a winter from ice storms and this is one of my favorite lights and can be depended on along with the light from the freeplay plus. I got mine at the local Target store and I think it was only $35.00 and well worth it	1
B000FAFGRW:clever_and_useful:ross_a._brunetti_"rb"	I never found the fork part of a spork to be very useful. Now we have this Light My Fire spork, and I have to wonder why nobody thought of this before! Nearly perfect for typical backpacker meals - probably MRE's too. If you've a friend or relative "over there", send 'em one	1
B0002L4ZK8:wayfinder_a_guiding_light:gil_evans_"lost_in_the_woods"	This has been a great addition to my truck - a useful compass and outside thermometer without going to the expense of a navigation system (and without having to learn another techno-gadget).  My only complaint is that the display illumination could be a bit brighter.  I realize that a bright light on the dashboard could impair one's night vision, but a bit more contrast on the display would be helpful at night.	1
B000AL8FHY:focus_on_abs:silvia_bridger_"truth_about_caffeine.com"	This ab machine focuses your workout on the abdominal muscles like not many other ab machines do.  You'll be surprised by the results	1
B0001EJIXK:silica_gel_-_good_value:s._krause	This item is a good value and comes packaged in a convienent container.  The beads can be reactivated by simply following the manufacturer's instructions and baking in an oven.  the 40 gram package is nice sized for small spaces/drawers, however larger spaces may require more than one.  Overall, this item is a nice value for those that do not want to buy the silica gel in a bulk package and deal with making your own container(s).  I would recommend for anyone keeping tools or other collectables where moisture is not wanted	1
B0009PURPO:kept_us_dry!:sarah_sharp	We pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in Northern MI, where weather is very unpredictable.  We've had other tents that took FOREVER to set up, but this one was super simple.  I think it too two of us less than 15 minutes to have it up and ready.  We loved the size of this tent - plenty of room for our air mattress and gear.  The air circulation was great, too.  Even in the heat of the day, we had a nice breeze keeping us cool, thanks to a miriad of windows.  When rain came during the night, we stayed dry, though I would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent.  Overall, we're really happy with this tent (especially for the price!), and plan to use it for several years	1
B000FVAPHW:good_bang_for_the_buck:darkness	This review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike.	1
B000KL7PZC:very_fun_for_a_youngster_(6_to_10).:j._shultz_"contractor"	No, this gun isn't very powerful - but THAT'S THE POINT. This gun is perfect for a young kid to learn about guns.  Slow enough you can actually see the BB, accurate enough to hit a target routinely at around 20 to 25 feet	1
B00074USV0:good_product_when_it's_new:han_r._chen_"cap_hansolo"	after a several uses, the anti-fog starts to fail...	1
B0007ZKIPU:you_don't_have_to_be_a_runner_to_love_bodyglide:j._west_"browniz"	I recently returned from almost 3 weeks of treking around Italy. I'm not a runner (or a walker, or even mildly aerobic) and I have baby-tender feet, so I was very concerned about blistering. On the advice of some runner-friends, I bought BodyGlide and coated my feet with it EVERY DAY before I put on my socks and shoes. My feet were tired and achy every night, but NO BLISTERS!! This is an amazing testament to the power of BodyGlide because sometimes I can have blisters wearing normal shoes during a normal, low activity work-day, and I was walking for hours at a time over bricks, cobblestones, you-name-it. If you are going to be traveling where you will be walking more than usual or on a differnt terrain then you are used to, buy a big, ol stick of Bodyglide and coat your feet every day	1
B00076ZE76:everlast_80lb_heavy_bag:kenny_"kenny_g&#8482;"	this is a must have for anyone interested in boxing or boxing fitness. Everlast is the most trusted brand in boxing history. established in 1910 they are a quality company that specializes in boxing equipment. take it from an owner of an everlast heavy bag they are great and very durable and can withstand lots of punishment. great for any teen, young male or old tymer tryin to get his groove back	1
B00076ZDSG:just_what_i_ordered:cody_p._dawson	Hand wraps were sent quickly and were in good condition.  Thanks	1
B000G01WA6:back_pain_reliever:carole_d._roach	I use my inversion table two or three times a day for short intervals of a few minutes each whenever my lower back starts	1
B000BNZ0JM:well-constructed_and_clever_multi-tool:michael_couto	A friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the Blackburn Airfix after I bought it. He has had many occasions where his chain has broken, or his tires have punctured, so he wanted to compare the weight of the Blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides. The Airfix weighed in at about 245 grams - about 8 ounces - and his tools, including inflator, tire levers, hex wrenches and chain tool (all included in the airfix) tipped the scales at 337 grams - about 11 ounces. I suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools, but for handiness, this seems hard to beat. The Blackburn lifetime/no-questions-asked guarantee is also very attractive.	1
B000BNXKYY:great_all-around_bike_computer.:dave	I just received the Blackburn Delphi 6.0 earlier this week, and I've already put it through a few rides.  I'm upgrading from a Cateye Astrale 8 that I've had for a long time.  I've started training with a heart rate monitor more seriously lately, and I thought having a single integrated unit to handle both features would be great.  I almost bought the Delphi 5.0 a while ago, but decided to hold out for the 6.0 to get the nifty altimeter features.	1
B0000BUT0F:my_daughter_loves_these!:l._dodd_"laureenmt"	I just ordered a pair of these for my son, since my daughter is so pleased with them.  The wheel base is wide enough that beginners can get their balance quickly.  The wheels roll very smoothly.  The velcro attachment at the top provides ankle support, and is easier to adjust than just laces.  A fun outdoor activity!	1
B0007TYO88:simple_and_fun:anonymous_"anonymous"	I got this as a gift and just love it.  You wouldn't believe how difficult it is to balance on it without using your legs.  It's fun and you can just use it while you're watching TV.  How could that be wrong	1
B0001B163I:lifestyle_online_magazine_southbeachdiet.co.uk:she_unlimited_magazin_www.sheunlimited.com_"a_magazine_for_women"	Awesome, for an advid user in Pedometer, I really love this one.    It is accurate and consise, some other pedometers out there have many complicated menus.	1
B0002BS9MI:nice_racket._balance_of_power_and_control:srihari_padmanabhan_"hari"	I have this for a month now. It has two pices joined by rubber which reduces the shock. In addition you might want to attach that rubber shock absorber which you can get under $5 in a sports store.	1
B00062JDK0:great_product:w._vacca_"w_vacca"	If you need to eliminate chafing from runing, jogging or just active walking, this is the stuff to use. Rolls on like deodorant. One application will last for a whole day. Highly recommend	1
B00074USZQ:exquisite_cap:emily_kingsley_"emily"	Just the perfect cap!. It fits like no other swimming cap. It won't pull you hair when removing it, neither will slip a bit from your head after swimming several laps or flip turning. Very resistant material, and a great finish. Awesome colors!	1
B0009A6KFU:good_cot_for_scout_camp:ohio_mom	This is a good size cot for a smallish boy scout.  It's a little small for an adult, but it fits in the tent well. The only complaint is it requires a lot of strength to set up and take apart, but it is lightweight and comfortable	1
B000H25WWM:good_workout:barbara_d._regen_"english_major"	This product does what it claims it will do.  Put in the time and effort - you'll feel great! Of course, I don't ever expect to look like the model on the box.  However, I feel good and I think I look a little better than when I started.  Only doing it a few weeks, but enjoying it	1
B0007IS71E:w._trimmer:carson_l._tyner	I love the procuct and it does provide the  reslults predicted.  However I would like to see the band width widden a couple inches or I would like to see something like this maybe in a vest/shorts combination to achieve the same results on my chest and upper stomach	1
B000E9TCY2:great_stroller!:m._yatsevich_"new_mother"	Very, very good stroller! And very convinient, too. This stroller can be used on different type of terrains and is very maneuravabble.	1
B0000C5GCV:versaflex_is_a_joy_to_use!:neplusultra	I am a dedicated martial artist that has been frustrated in my attempts to attain greater flexibility. Despite my previous instructor's claim that these types of machines are a waste of time & money, I decided to investigate the potential effectiveness of the "Versaflex". Based on this investigation, I purchased this machine & in the very short amount of time that I have used it, I am really happy. For me it makes stretching very relaxing & comfortable. I am very impressed!	1
B000B64INI:great_jumping_rope:embracing_disorder_"danielle"	I am very happy with this product. It's made of the best material for speed and the timer beeps if you set it.	1
B00074H822:harbinger_331000_speed_jump_rope:carla_roberts_"carla"	I am very happy with this jump rope.  It was very easy to adjust to my height.  I have not jumped rope in years and wanted something new to add to my workout.  I am enjoying this jump rope very much.  It is very light and user friendly.	1
B00079Y8CA:great_if_you_do_not_have_a_lot_of_space:john_kitchens_"electronics_fan"	The Power Blocks are great if you don't have a lot of space to keep a full set of dumbells.  Changing weight is very easy and you can go change weight in 5 pound increments.  In addition to the 45 pound set, you can get an upgrade to increase the weight of each to 60 pounds (for around $150)	1
B000H99Z4G:definetly_worth_.89c:iva_bigin	Its better then shakin the bottle, jams atleast once per fill but its only .89c !! Buy a few and you'll survive. Slam On !!!	1
B00091RXMS:great_item_and_good_price!:a._davis	This bar is great when used properly, i.e. make sure the door is closed when you use it.  I was surprised how well it worked, much better than relying on someone to hold your feet while doing situps or cruches.	1
B00084IBPE:great_gift_idea!:savvy_consumer	I bought 3 of these for holiday presents this year and everyone loves them! Inexpensive but not easy to find. I was told easy to use. My dad labelled 2 boxes of balls on Christmas morning	1
B000GWCYDS:chicago_girls_skates:kim_collins	I ordered these for my 7 year old daughter and she loves them.  She wasn't really used to skating either, but has done very well on them. Not too many falls and learned easily.  Great item even for beginners!!!	1
B00070QEC6:great_swim_cap:m._busch_"mab"	I had trouble getting water in my ears before wearing this cap.  Now no problem!  It keeps my hair fairly dry, or at least drier than with other caps I've tried.  It's easy to put on and take off--no hair pulling.  It's lasted well so far.  Much better than wearing a cap with a chin strap.	1
B0009VAFRI:really_nice_results:maria_estela_cartagena_"roberto_ramos"	Hey if you are thin and you are on gym you should use this product, it raelly goo	1
B000FZ4ROU:nice_addition_to_the_world_of_hiking_and_camping:jeff_edwards_"radiojeff"	First off, let me start by saying that I really like my Summit watch.  It is large (some may go so far to call it HUGE) but it is surprisingly lightweight on my wrist, and quite comfortable to wear.  Those with bad eyesight will STILL be able to see the easy-to-read digital readout of the time, barometric pressure, altitude and compass.  The numbers are quite big, so they are difficult to miss.	1
B000E3D2VM:satisfies_this_law_student's_needs...:john_english	I have ridiculously large books and a half hour walk to and from the train station each day.  Unlike every other backpack I've tried, the straps of this one have yet to start ripping or fraying apart from the bag.  The only feature I miss is a buckle connecting the two straps across the front of the chest, so they don't pull apart at the shoulders.  However, the bag is heavy-duty and roomy, and I'm easily able to fit my laptop, Con Law book (maybe the largest book ever made), Crim Law book (2nd largest ever), and pocket dictionary.  Overall, if you can get as good a price as I paid for it, I would recommend it to any student or other user..	1
B000GGB91C:mostly_dry:lund_wolfe	I used mine for two weeks snorkeling in Hawaii. It isn't perfect. It does take on a little bit of water sometimes when you go below the surface, but it isn't enough to cause any problems.	1
B00026IAPY:great_flags!:burnin'_up_in_az_(gl)_"glecko"	Just like the ones used in college intra-murals, excellent stitching and look to be very durable.  Fast shipping, and great deal	1
B0000712ZP:great,_classic_boot:t._mead_"t-mead"	I don't usually select items by &quot;name brand&quot;, so I tried many other boots before I tried the Timberlands.  But none seemed as well constructed or was as comfortable.  I have had them for 4 months and they have proved waterproof (in rain and puddles, thus far) and have shown very little wear	1
B000ESPGQ6:high_quality_product:l._wooten	I didn't know what to expect, but these turned out to be very good quality.  They stretch well and return to shape.  They don't feel like they are going to snap apart when you are in the middle of exercising.  I was very pleased with the product.  Be careful, though, if you have a latex allergy.  I also got excellent service from the company!  I would definitely do business with them again	1
B0000BYO97:works_great_for_cars:timur_tabi	There's not a lot of information out there on using this extractor for cars, because I think most people buy it for boats instead.  So I'm going to talk about how well it works on changing the oil in your car.	1
B0009IK0YE:a_good_value:dufus	This paddle is a bargain here at Amazon.  Sports stores would easily sell this for over $20.  Having said that, I found it to be slightly heavier and the thicker sponge made it difficult for me to adjust my game.  "BUT", I still eliminated many a younger player at our men's retreat.  There's nothing better than seeing the face of a 23 year old when a 53 year old kicks his rear!  Thanks, Stiga	1
B0000AXYBD:automotive_use:james_woodlock	After polishing alloy wheels I treated them with Boeshield. It leaves a waxy film that attracts dust and dulls the finish, however there is no sign of tarnish or oxidation. Very easy to clean off when you want really bright wheels	1
B000GGO05E:terrific_training_product!:m._elmore	I purchased the Kwik Kik for my 11-year-old to use as a training aid for the recreational soccer program he is involved with.  It was fairly easy to put together and, once the base is filled with sand (it cannot be filled with water), it's simple to move it from place to place.  The Kwik Kik is a great way to build up the strength and stamina in his feet and legs!  I love the fact that he can use it either in-doors or out-doors, so he'll be able to use it to keep training throughout the year.  Great Product	1
B0009VCA1M:speedsafe:jeremy_j._mcneal	I thought the speedsafe was a button that you press which flings the knife open.  I was dissapointed to find that it is just a spring that helps it open faster.  Other than that, this knife is ultra high-quality, definately the best I have owned	1
B000B8FQUK:great_casual_bike:f._t._baumgardner	I bought this bike after not riding since I was 14 (32 now).  The box arrived in excellent condition and the bike was nearly completely assembled.  I also had a little trouble with adjusting the front brake but got it figured out.  Overall this is a great bike for those casual trips around town.  I'm not a trail seeker, so have never tried it off road.  Very happy with the quality and ease of assembly	1
B000DLB992:most_fun_i've_had_in_a_long_time:kevin652	The one I bought is green and black - looks good in the water. I first look this kayak (dingy really) out into the Gulf of Mexico. The swells were two two three feet and the harder I paddled the behinder I got. I thought I had made a bad purchase but then I took the dingy into Clearwater Bay with much calmer waters and I'm having the time of my life.	1
B000KKVM1G:amazing_shipping_speed.:rabid_mongoose_"bleh,_im_a_rabid_mongoose!"	I Bought this sword on the 25'th of december. Got it on the 27'th of December. Paid for standard shipping.	1
B000LSHT9G:very_bright_but_awkward:kevin_salerno_"icarustwo"	I already owned a Fenix P1 which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny.  It was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me.  Even a great light source is useless if it's not accessible when you need it.  I owned a Surefire Ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive.  But you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades.  I love the rear clicky button design and the 5 levels of light.  I expected some similar design elements in this new Fenix. I was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right, then left right again and so on.  So if there is one setting you use most often, you must go through the whole 5 turns just to get back to it next time.  Come on, that's just stupid.  I will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires.  But there is no comparison as far as construction or quality. So 4 stars is all I could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction.	1
B0007W7VXU:valeo_competition_lifting_gloves_:dusti_howery_"dusti"	I ordered these for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES them, he says that they are better than any that they have at his gym.  Very durable and only moderately padded, great for the price	1
B000HFQU8O:great_night-time_fun_for_kids:edward_mcnair	The kids at our church campout had a great time with the Aerobie SkyLighter Lighted frisbee's we bought for them.  They took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work.	1
B000IOQ0KW:awesome_stroller!:j._breger	I bought this stroller after much research and deliberation.  It is comfortable for my [...]as well as my [...]daughter.  It handles wonderfully. It folds pretty well too.  The front swivel wheel makes a huge difference with manuverability and the adjustable handle bar is a great feature. I am tall and it helps to have the handle where I need it.   I have used this for both walking, shopping and jogging and think it is perfect!  From purchase to delivery it took maybe 5 days.  I am extremely happy with all aspects of this purchase.  I love this stroller!	1
B00075LNG8:great_hrm:arthur_from_nyc	Had this device for 3 months, absolutely love it! The chest strap you must wear in order to detect your heart rate takes a little time to adjust to, but it is very accurate. The most useful feature offered that is not included in many heart rate monitor devices on the market is being able to keep track of the distance you ran, the speed (max and average), and calories expended. This allows you to control your pace while running by speed, or because some days your body may react differently to exercise and may fluctuate; you can change your training accordingly with the heart rate monitor function. You are also able to easily program the watch so that it will alert you once you've reached a target heart rate, or time, or speed, and even resting rates, laps, etc., essentially letting you program your interval training. Distance is very accurate once calibrated manually. Never owned a gps based heart rate monitor before, but I chose this the gps based hrm because I need reliability (according to some reports on gps based hrm, the gps signal is weak when running in places with trees or tall buildings). Besides, if I get lost, I figure the extra running can't hurt me =	1
B0009VC9RW:kershaw_ken_onion_a-1:george_j._grazioso	Perhaps the best and most useful pocket knife you can have	1
B000HHEF2K:fun_for_all_ages:l._clarke	I bought one of these for friends that have children, and one for a friend who is married without children.  They all seemed to love it!	1
B000ASG0VU:apex_deluxe_3-tier_dumbbell_rack:h._g._hubbard_"hub"		1
B000BIUK9C:dare_i_say,_too_bright?:gregory_m._li_"gregmli.blogspot.com"	I bought this for when I work on my car/motorcycle in my apartment building's parking lot. The lighting is poor, and I've found headlamps to be an absolute necessity.	1
B00099IABI:better_then_other_sight.:s._chhin	I used this for paintball on my military simulation A-5. I see other sights and I was worry about this since its cheaper. The red and green dot is MUCH more visible then my brother in law more expensive BSA also.	1
B000EXK4ZE:great_gun,:jane_rood	First off this gun shoots a mile !!!  I hit my friend in the head.  It left a welt the size of a 2 quarters!!!!!!!!!!!  If I was you I would bey this gun!!	1
B000ENQT3A:good_stuff:orly_schuchmacher_"orly"	i get frequent ear infections any time i get water in my ears. i took these to a water park and they worked perfect. They are very soft and wont make your ear sore	1
B000GUZHS4:i_was_worried_but-:comin_up_"shani"	I had concerns when I ordered this machine. Like the fact that I am so short. I didn't know if it would be designed for taller people. It worked fine for my height as well as my husbands height. (I am 5') I also had concerns because I have arthritis but I was able to do this without causing flare ups all the time and I am able to set goals and get a decent workout. I am able to adjust the machine to more difficult tensions so this is something that will last a very long time for me. The only drawback that I have found with this machine is that it hurts the toes a bit. Mine are starting to get use to it a bit. This machine is worth the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone especially those suffering with bone disease such as I am. It is a wonderful way to get healthier without compromising on pain	1
B000DINAR4:excellent_product.__teeter_delivered_exactly_what_they_promised.:c._david	I have been very happy with the hang-ups and have used them for the last month.  I have not had any issues and they look to be built very well	1
B000IORPYW:awesome!:david_d._clark	This is a better stroller than the other three (all for one child) strollers we have. Very maneuverable and adjustable. It turns on a dime and seats adjust up and down independently. Folds down very quickly. It's great that the kids can sit next to each other.	1
B0007NT4MA:great_compartmentalization,_a_little_stress:v._lam_"e3vl"	Pros:	1
B0003S5VPS:liquid_stevia:lawrence_tyndall	GREAT alternative to sugar. The FDA clearly doesn't care if we become diabetic, so we have to care for ourselves. This is a good part of God's creation being used for its designed purpose. Plus, the company was quick to get it to me and it arrived as promised. Great experience. I will buy again	1
B000B76IGW:solar_belt_:patrick_j._schibi_"bankerman"	This works just like the ad says. It is easy to use, is comfortable, and does concentrate your workout on the midsection. I am very pleased.	1
B000FOKYSE:factor_x_quarter_pipe:sheryl_andrus	Kids love this quarter pipe.  However, did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions.  Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company.  It did take a while to assemble	1
B0007OWSWW:excellent_product!:vmm	I'm a single mother with a full-time job, taking part-time graduate classes are night.  I have very little time to myself, let alone any time to go to the gym.  I needed something that was fun and energizing to do at home, after my child went to sleep.  I found the PERFECT product!  I recommend this to anyone that wants to get a good workout in the comfort and privacy of their own home	1
B0009WXVC8:great_for_boys_(and_girls)_ages_6-56!:d._m._howe_"mom_x_3"	This - along with a pogo stick and stilts - was my effort to get my kids offf the video games at least some of the time! I thought this might be too hard for the 6 year old, but he persisted and is getting better at it. The point is, it's so fun he keeps trying! The 13 yr old - and my 17 year old daughter are enjoying it too. There seems to be a trade-off between the stilts and the hit-a-way. Only the little guy can handle the pogo stick - go figure	1
B000BAWDV8:warm_-even_when_not_using_the_battery_feature:e._gonzales_"themightyed"	Probably the best cold weather gloves I've purchased.  They are warm without being too bulky.  I have not yet been in low enough temps where I needed to use the battery feature	1
B0007N47S6:all_here:lisa_"reader"	This kit will not only help you get started, it will help you stay with the program too	1
B000BW0C0A:pleased_with_my_choice...:c._patton	I knew I wanted a bowflex and couldn't decide between the models available.  This model offers the most range in exercises and still has the ability to fold up small enough to be able to set up a double air mattress in my "spare/exercise" room for a weekend guest.	1
B000LQ4X24:red_xl_review:robert_f._walls_sr.	USE THE XL MOST EVERY DAY AND FIND THAT IT DOES A FAIRLY GOOD JOB FOR WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO. ONLY USE IT ABOUT TEN MINENTS AT A TIME SINCE I AM 72 I DONT OVERDUE IT. CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN MY ABDOMEN ALREADY	1
B000ESLBQK:assembly_was_easy:b._m.	After reading the horror stories of the assembly process/instructions I was a little worried.	1
B000FTHEG4:loved_this_extra_long_mat__great_for_taller_yogis_:felicity_"felicity07"	Loved this mat!	1
B0007Q3URC:great_backpack,_but_zipper_gets_caught:joelsindc	Love this backpack, it's been with me to numerous cities and countries and survives the trips very well, while protecting the contents well, laptop included.  The outside large pocket is larger than you think when you realize just how much stuff you can fit in there, and still fit under an airplane seat.  Love the two water holders on the outside. Love the zippers are a loop so you can attach a carabiner, compass, or whatever. The support is great, you'll barely feel its there, and if you do, just use both straps, and then strap the front for great support. The pen storage area could be larger to accommodate larger pens, but thats quite minor.	1
B000AO9TP8:top_quality_item:a._starovoytov	I am very happy with my choice. It is just the right size, nicely finished with glossy black paint, installs in a minute. Usage is very convenient: it has that perfect click-into-place property: you push down on it with your forefoot and it snaps into the "stand" position. To "hide" it when you are ready to go, just hit back with your heel or simply start pedalling and it snaps back along the frame. It does the job perfectly and it feels great	1
B000HKCBE6:great_value:d._harris_"prazdancr"	This item arrived within a few days of purchase. It is a great value for the price. I did have to assemble it from pictures, but got it together without any outside assistance. I plan to use it along with the reformer I already own. I do wish that there was a CD or chart with basic exercises for this product. Their customer service was quick and helpful, when I had a component arrive damaged by the shipper	1
B0006MQ2TA:lots_of_fun!:v._fox	My kids got these from Grandpa.  They love them!  They're fun to bowl with in a dark room.  We've clipped them onto headboards for a decent-sized reading light.	1
B0000YAF6A:awsome_scope:	GREAT SCOPE has good zoom and works good for 22. and super 9 air guns. Note that its dovetail and not weaver though Great Scop	1
B0000BUTBH:they_c_me_rollen:	these roller blades are great they weren't to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i'm doing 420 to krooked grind to 270 out. I recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well.	1
B0000B39MM:it_works:pt	There's not much I can say about this item. It works, and that's all I really care about. No leaks, it's never cracked, and it's stood up to some serious abuse.	1
B000BGI5AK:pretty_nice_machine:c._barnes	My wife and I put this thing together in about an hour.  There was one cracked foot tread, but after calling Schwinn, we had a replacement within two days and no hassles.  If you are looking for a decent machine at a great price, this is a nice one.  It is fairly sturdy and has some nice preprogrammed workouts	1
B0001HAC8M:this_is_a_great_product_with_1_drawback:richard_e._farmer	I am very pleased with this rack.  the only thing I do not like is that to install the rack you have to hand tighten it to your roof rack.  I would have thought they would have a quick release latch or something.  I guess I'm just lazy.  I reccoment this product	1
B000IY84II:lifecore_r900_rowing_machine:bill	The display didn't work on the first rower we got, and one of the wheels on the front of it was broken.  Amazon sent out a new one the day I reported the problem, and helped me get UPS to pick up the damaged one.  The second rower arrived in good shape, and works fine.  The different programs are nice, it's extremely quiet, and my wife likes it better than the air rower we use at the Y.  The slightly padded seat is also a bonus.  One of the most important features for us was the heart rate monitor.  It comes with the chest strap, and displays heart rate on the LCD screen so you can vary your workout to stay in the target zone.  The heart rate monitor is not available on inexpensive rowers, and with some of the more expensive ones, you still have to buy the chest transducer separately.  Overall, quite satisfied with the rower, and because of their excellent customer service, extrememly satisfied with Amazon	1
B0000CA2P6:better_then_standard_hand_devices.:j._townsend_"kf_enthusiest"	I had one of these years ago and just recently purchased a new one I can say without hesitation that the product really works.  Its great for martial artists, particularly those whose arts rely on grabs, chokes, and need strength in the hands.	1
B0007P8FK0:this_keeps_the_band_where_you_want_it_to_be._:nature_lady	This very comfortable strap can be put around your wrist or ankle and when you do the exercise, you can just concentrate on the muscle you're working and not have to worry about the theraband slipping.  It's terrific	1
B000HBMFRS:convenient:cheryl_cannaday_"witchywoman"	This was bought for my boyfriend and I to sleep on when he comes to town. It is very comfortable and there is a lot of room for us!  It loses a tiny bit of air during the night but not so much that it is on the floor or anything.  It is a little difficult to get up off of it in the morning because it is like a water bed. If you get a good wave going you can jump right up!  The other problem I had with it is that it makes me sweat.  Even with the covering and a sheet. I am still sleeping on vinyl and so I sweat.  Not a lot but it is noticeable in the morning.  I am happy with the fact that it holds a lot of weight too because I am a big woman and my boyfriend is a big man. It holds us with no problem.  It was over all a very good purchase and I am happy with it	1
B000BUJP6Y:best_optical_swimming_googles:blue_cat	This is a great pair of swimming goggles.  I swim a couple of times a week and I can't see a thing without my glasses.  This pair is very comfortable and does a great job correcting my vision.  I can't imagine swimming without them.  They have a wide field of vision, the adjustment is easy to use, and stays adjusted.  I've never had a problem with leaking.  For less then twenty dollars you can't go wrong. They are the best goggles I have ever owned.  Much better then the other brands.	1
B00028XQVK:this_pot_rocks:j._olsson_"pathfinder"	Mine is blackened, scratched, dented and I don't even carry the insides any more, but I love it.  This is usually the only cooking pot I carry backpacking because so much of our cooking anymore involves boiling water.  The wide mouth is perfect for scooping up water or snow.  I think it's part bucket.  This is the one	1
B0009VC9Y0:speed_safe_broke,_but_no_big_deal:j_"smiley"	I've had this knife and their rainbow leak model for few years. All I wanted was a thin, small and light knife and I got it. The blade material is hard enough to stay sharp for a while, soft enough to easily sharpen but not brittle like a ceramic or carbon steel knife for example. I have had the vary tip break a couple times but it's because I was doing something foolish with it (like using it as a throwing knife *wink wink* ;) ). It's not the best, it's not the worst but can compete with ether, witch is the best in my opinion. Shortly after I bought it the speed safe spring broke, eehhh who cares it opens fine without. It's vary well made it can take all of my fat butts weight easily when laying sideways on a hard surface. It's vary thin profile is comfortable and I sometimes can't tell if I have it with me or not. It has what looks like brass or copper washers/bushings instead of cheap thin steel/plastic ones (means no binding up, even when in need of oil). The frame lock is far stronger than a line lock and best of all it deforms and wares much slower meaning my knife will stay ridged when opened for a long time.	1
B0008G1OOM:good_durable_gloves:cyril_azoulay_"clavie"	I've been using these gloves for 3 years now and I had to buy a new pair as they were starting to be ripped off between the fingers.	1
B000EJV22W:nice_floor_for_the_price:csb	very nice flooring for the price. easy to put together. I use it as weight room flooring in an exercise area I have set up in my garage. If you are looking for aerobic room flooring, I would recommend buying the 20mm version	1
B000BKPWI4:works_well:michael_a._maharajh_"rajh"	This chin up bar works well. I'm 160lbs and it holds me with ease. Great addition to any other home gym equipment, or if your on the road and need to work out in your hotel room or whatnot	1
B0000AXR97:marine_cooler:jeanna_"outsidev"	This cooler is the perfect fit and size for our boat! The compact size was the main reason for buying this cooler. The lid is easy to open and close and it doubles as an extra seat.  It keeps everything nice and cold all day on the boat.	1
B000F6NCZ4:perfect_for_weightlifting_home_gym:tool_guy	Great flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. It's heavy and very dense, very similar if not the same type of stuff you see in most commercial gym's. Heavy duty, takes dropped dumbbell punishment, and resists damage/cuts. Use a drywall T-Square as a guide, and put a new blade in a box cutter. Take several passes to cut it and take your time. It cuts straight and square for a professional look. I will definitely buy these again when I get a bigger room for the gym	1
B000FDQ0E2:best_bearings_ever,_and_the_best_price_here_at_amazon!:a._bensko	I already have a set of standard Bones Swiss, but since I was putting together a longboard with smaller wheels, I decided to get slightly faster bearings to make up for it.  These definately firt the bill, and the with the cheap $35.00 price and free shipping that Amazon offers, you can't go wrong.  These may seem dissappointing at first, but after about 3-5 hours of riding, they'll break in and go very fast.  Overall very reccomendable to anyone in the skateboard world	1
B000AP6MGQ:better_than_expected:jspada	my husband looooved it from the moment he opened the box. excellent quality. looks very expensive.	1
B0002V3E6Y:they_are_very_well_made_for_the_price:travis_goodman_"tsg"	I am very pleased with Knife's . The vender was great. I ordered them and in 3 days I had them . Thank You all. TS	1
B00029I1BO:it's_ok:	I bought this gun and 2 days after the dang stock broke. other than that it was ok, good acuricy. the clip holds 545 in the amunition holder. and 15-17 shots in the magazine. also the lazers sight does not work	1
B0001W7D4I:fun_exercise:juljacky_"a_happy_mom"	I bought this for my son (recommended by his special ed teacher) and the whole family has been using it ever since.  It's a nice, sturdy, trampoline and it's not too expensive.  The "folding" part is a little disappointing which I why it's not getting full stars.  However, we haven't needed to use that feature so it wasn't that important to us.  Overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive	1
B000F68QF0:nice_board_good_price:rb_"liveoutdoors"	Skim boards keep the kids busy for hours, this a great way to get the kids away from the TV. This board is nice especially with Free shipping..	1
B0007VB4IY:f4_is_the_perfect_size_and_the_perfect_monitor:susan_c._van_abs_"forever_dieter"	I am very impressed with the F4. It is very easy to use and a good basic heart rate monitor. It is easier to program than my F6, and it fits better.	1
B000JF20LI:great_elliptical!!:bev	I bought this item after much research and this particular model was suggested to me by a friend.  No problems at all with shipping; package was in perfect shape though only delivered to my back steps.  I opened up the box and brought in pieces individually, with the flywheel being the heaviest (though I was able to bring in myself).  It took me about 2 hours to put together.  Instruction book was better than most I have seen, and only problem was the misprint in bolt sizes, but you can figure that out easily (as everyone has noted on their reviews).  The elliptical's size is on the smaller size and fits well in my sitting room.  Easily moved if need be.	1
B00065X08I:great_product:m._siler	This thing is great. Built tough as nails. There are myriad exercises for you to do from beginner to advanced as your core strength and stability improve. You won't be disappointed in the results if you stick with it. Get it. USE it.	1
B000FGCVE2:nice_trike:c._key	We got this for our son.  He loves it!!!  Can't hardly reach the pedals but that dont stop him.  Stylish and well built, I think it should last a long time.  Great product, would recomend to anyone!!	1
B000AMRN44:good_product_that_can_be_improved:rolando_cordero	I used to have a similar product, this one works the same except for one little handy detail: it doesn't stand on itself like the old one I had	1
B0000AXK1Q:pointed_aluminum_kubaton:citan-uzuki_"citan-uzuki"	Many years ago, an acquaintance of mine was the property manager of a low-rent motel.  One morning, while he was in the back office behind the front desk, two men jumped over the counter and started beating on the door.  He could see them, but they could not see him through the privacy security glass.  The men continued to beat on the door, trying to get in.  He waited inside patiently, with his Glock pistol.  As soon as the door fell and the men ran inside, he shot them both.  They turned out to be high school teenagers who were trying to break in to obtain crack money.  I recalled that many in the community dissaproved of his actions.  It turned out that he had plenty of time to leave through the back door and call for help.  When asked why he had to kill them, he simply said, "I own the life of anyone who threatens my personal safety.  I did it because it was my right and I could."  Fortunately, it was considered self-defense.	1
B000FZX944:built_like_a_tank.__keeps_food_warm_for_hours.:dude	I wonder why the other reviewer had leaking problems - perhaps a bad silicon seal?  I compared this in store to other products by thermos, no-names, etc, and it is one of the most solidly built food carry products I've ever seen or used.  I should have bought it years ago, and it would have saved hundreds of dollars via home-made lunches.  And jeez, the worry that every time you put tupperware/ziplock lunches in your bag, something is going to leak - how much is that worth to put to rest forever?  I used to wrap my food-carrying plastic wear in TWO plastic bags in case of inevitable leakage.  Never again.  This thing is solid.	1
B0001WAWSM:the_little_knife_with_the_big_width.:b_gutzman_"ssg_g"	The Cold Steel Spike Tanto is a lot of knife for a reasonable price.	1
B0007QCOLK:exceeds_expectations;_fillets_fish_in_a_pinch:andrew_j._riemer_"andrew_james_riemer"	I've always loved Victorinox Swiss Army Knives, but I must admit that I when I purchased this one, I was not sure if I made the right choice, but my expectations were soon exceeded.  It was right before a trip to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota, I had lost my other Swiss Army Knife (a Tinker), and I was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade.  I did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness.  I settled on this one because it was on sale, and I have not been disappointed.	1
B0009U787O:decent_knife:e._wamser	Good knife to throw in your survival kit. Compass is worthless but other than that it seemed well made	1
B000FNI1W6:must_have_on_me_at_all_times.:john_"american_consumer"	I have bought over 20 of these knives.  I trim my nails, open packages, write notes, tighten screws, and strip wire (great for stripping wire).  You can buy replacement toothpicks and pens.  I put toothpicks in place of the twizzers.  I have never used the twizzers in 30 years.  I can use the toothpick a couple times a day.  I would love to see a thinner version with an LED, toothpick and pen.	1
B000H96C7E:super_day_pack:g._r._gillespie	I bought one of these a while back to use as a day pack for hiking. I find it an absolutely great backpack. It has enough compartments for everything I need to carry as well as a ton of smaller pockets for nick knacks and smaller items.	1
B0001NQ7M6:swivel_rod_rack:tphilpott_"t"	Extra heavy, somewhat difficult to assemble.  Good quality.  Will hold 24 rods but not with reels attached, more like 12 rods/reel combos	1
243767	I used it about 10 times in 2 years and it did the job well. Used it as blower and mulcher and was pretty happy with the results. Unfortunately now it smells like burnt everytime i use it. I opened it up the other day and it looks the like motor collectors are giving up. Not an expesive tool but it should have lasted more than 2 years of light use	0
415317	I was really looking forward to getting this tool and saving some time.  It sorely disappointed me.  It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.   It seems like a good idea, but I guess I'll have to make my own to get it  to work right	0
82698	These are great cleaning wipes. Living here on the east coast when it snows and the salt and road dirt get all over the car it's not so easy to get to a car wash right away, pull one of these out and it cleans so well and leaves a great shine. My husband and I use these even after going to a car wash when you see water spots just 1 sheet will clean it all up. I hope they don't stop making them. Lately have not been able to find them in the stores....	1
134142	This one is just as bright as the AA Mini MagLite and is considerably thinner and lighter. Extremely durable. I've had one for several years now and it's taken quite a beating in the car and in my toolbox	1
153976	If I could afford it, I'd get one for each of my gardener friends. Sometimes I might need a spade or pruners or shovel, but overall, the hori hori is often the only tool I take outside to plant and weed.	1
198814	I was a little doubtful because of the complaint about blade changing, but obviously that consumer was wrong. This was easy to operate, fast and the best unit I could have purchased	1
198820	It's the best saw that I have ever used. I'm used to use jig saw and circular saw. However, the reciprocating saw is OUTSTANDING ! I'm using this to cut trees, metal, pipes and heavy woods. The performance of this saw is amazing	1
243765	After a week of researching hand held blowers on the Internets (lol), I came to the conclusion that this is the best hand blower money could buy. I have never used another hand blower in my life so I cannot compare to any another blower, but I must say I am still very impressed. So I decided to wake up the neighborhood and take the this blower out for a test drive. I could not believe the amount of power this baby has. I ran it through my front yard and	1
243771	I absolutely love the blower part of this Toro, but have had some trouble with the vacuum.  It worked very well once, but the 2nd time we used it we couldn't disassemble it.  After much aggravation, mission was accomplished, but now I'm afraid to try it again.  I probably will since I enjoyed the vacuum, but you can't beat the power of the blower.  I'm addicted	1
284614	Had to buy 2 of these when book case I was building  was "redesigned" lol.	1
284619	They are a little pricey compared to say the clamps at Harbor Freight, but once you use them you will know why.  They are superior in every way.  When you clamp with them the wood does not move around since the jaws are parallel.  And you can get tons of clamping force out of them.  Very nice tools	1
296061	Excellent tool. No more lifting! The only thing easier is to pay someone else to shovel	1
350488	This mini Mag is really very good,though its a bit overpriced at amazon.com I realized it after purchasing.Future buyers check walmart/Target for a lower price	1
356778	Having used the Supra locks which I like a lot, I found the Master Lock key safe and tried it out.  It is VERY heavy duty, and holds much more than Supra.  The combo is easy to change (takes seconds) and it is VERY weather proof.  I like it better than the Supra except you must leave the combination dialed in to close it.  Someone could see it.  The Supra does not show which button(s) were pushed.  All things considered, I will be buying the Master Lock in the future.	1
447862	I got this as a freebie when I bought the Porter-Cable CFFN250N Finish & Brad Nailer Combo Kit on a promo a few months ago.  The saw worked great for tearing out a big part of my house to be remodeled, including nails, drywall, studs, etc..  I did have a little trouble with the blades and allen wrench at first (mostly just trying to keep track of the wrench), but now have things all figured out and it works great	1
447867	Ordering this item was very easy and it arrive quickly.  We finally got a chance to use it to cut post for our fence we are putting up, it cut the job in 1/2!!!	1
516026	I bought this as a blower, I don't intend on using the other functions. The unit is very powerful, more than my previous gas blower. The cord can be a pain, but this is the price you pay for not having to buy gas and being able to blow out your garage without the fumes. Overall, I really like the ease of use and it's high power	1
516032	I read the reviews before purchasing this electric blower. We have been very pleased so far with this blowers performance!! It is extremely powerful, quiet and easy to handle. I have been especially pleased when using the vacuum to suction up the leaf pile. It has been very efficient even when blowing or vacuuming up damp leaves. Although I was hesistant to buy electric and have to deal with the cord, it hasn't been a problem for us. I would recommend this product	1
517289	These wipes are a great way to remove dust from your car and leave a "wet-look" to the finish (don't use them on the windows though).  The shine lasts for several days and a couple of people have asked me what kind of "wax" I use on my car.  When I tell them I haven't been waxing the car, they look at me funny	1
577792	Im a cabinet builder for several years. Used pipe clamps for most of my career untill some one let me borrow a k-body. Now I have 12 k-bodys and mipe vast collection of pipe clamps sits and rusts. Improves the quality and speed of your work.....big time	1
577797	I have a fair number of cheapo clamps. Or, better yet, I have a fair number of clamps because they are cheap. Sure, they tend to fall apart and do not work smoothly, but they do actually work.	1
595320	Used it for 16 inches of wet snow (not all at once, I went out and shoveled every time snow reached 4 inches). Probably best only for small driveways and decks. Other customers offer valid points: it only shovels forward, which can come back to your face (wear a mask?). It won't handle 6 plus inches of snow any better than a regular shovel. I didn't experience damage to its parts, as others reported. You must rotate the handle 180 degrees to switch between snow and broom (another reviewer must've missed this part). You can alter the height placement of the adjustable handle (it was manageable for 5' 10" guy). The broom-mode wasn't any better than a regular broom.  I made up for the lack of directional throwing by altering the pattern of how I shoveled. Because I was never out more that 15 minutes, I never experienced freezing of orange power cord.  On sale, I think it was a very good value. It reduced my shoveling time, and like someone mentioned, it broke the monotony of shoveling	1
21829	I bought this for my 5  year old daughter and we tried to take very good care of it.  Within a few days of careful use, one of the latches bent, a hinge broke off and a piece of the edge came unglued.  It is a great idea, but needs better construction.  On a positive note, my daughter loved it and would have spent hours drawing and creating with the tools inside if I let her.  However, I had to take the box away so further damage does not occur before I can fix it.  The drawers work fine.  The problem is with the two doors on top that flip out.  Note about drawers; Little plastic door knobs pop out.  Need to be glued in.	0
72071	Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought.	0
219933	My 2 year old son loves to "cook" and to serve Mommy and Daddy meals from his kitchen.  My only complaint is that it falls over easily and it seems we are often picking it up off the floor.  It isn't very sturdy, but I'm not unhappy with this purchase	0
252088	We were excited to give this to our 5 year old for his birthday.  After opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied.  However the screen is very disappointing.  I can't even rate the games because overall I simply just can't see what is on it.  The product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing.  I should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products.  I would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it	0
399965	I've already spent way too much time trying to screw the basket in and hammer the wheel caps on.  What a pain in the neck. This was the most expensive cart and I can't believe it's taking this long to put together - not worth it	0
518292	I bought this for my daughter for her 11th birthday.  After playing the game once, she asked me if I could take it back.  She said that the game was boring because it was so limited as far as what you could do in the game.  My daughter has always played a lot of "simulated life" video games (i.e., the Sims, Animal Crossing) and online games (i.e, club penguin).  I suspect this is why she found this game limiting.  Other games that she has played portray a more intricate "life" and therefore draw the player in to a greater degree.  My advice would be to consider what your daughter is used to before buying this.  If your daughter has no experience in these types of games, this game will probably be fine.  However if your daughter has previously played simulated life games, she will probably find this one lacking.	0

B000FLF2NE:victum_of_bait_and__switch:r._j._bozich_"gramps"	I ordered 6 supreme moo mixers. They did arrive before Christmas. I received 6 standard moo mixers that should have been priced lower. I notified the company of the error and didn't receive a response. Very disappointed. Shame on them. I'm a victum of bait and switch....	0
B000A0OZRO:might_be_okay_for_a_5_year_old.:pen_name	This is a very cheaply made reproduction of Malfoy's wand.  Whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it's for.  It would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it, as it's cheap and made of plastic.  However for anyone else who craes about detail and feel, you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel	0
B000JM040A:better_to_play_with_sand_at_the_beach:alstrooper	This product reminds me of thick slightly mushy sand that you would play with at the beach except it comes in colors.  Playdough is much easier to work with if you want to build items/objects/shapes.  My daughter will play with playdough for hours but with this product, she lost interest after 10 minutes	0
B0007WX1J8:it's_beautiful_put_together!!_but....:crazytwins_"crazytwins"	Bought this for daughter for Christmas, and when I opened the box and saw the cardboard backing, debated on returning it. But they love the Pegasus Barbies, so figured okay, let's try it out! Is really beautiful when all put together, and my daughter LOVES it! But, that stupid cardboard backing. Nope, no way does it stay on at all. Am going to tape it to the wall behind the playset, and it will be fine. Right now is just standing up behind the set. Really, couldn't they have made a plastic piece with a big sticker with clouds/pegasus horses on it that attached to the back?	0
B0002KVI5Y:beautiful_game,_horribly_boring_gameplay:tiddlywinks	Don't be deceived by the box: Dread Pirate LOOKS like a really cool game with exceptionally made components, but it is DREADfully boring to play. The game is slow, tedious, and completely luck based, and simply no fun to play. You have been warned	0

B0006IRSP6:difficult_to_use:eleanor_lin	I am not too happy with this item.  It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot.  It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out.  And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use.  Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well	0
B000GGESEC:a_waste_of_money:patricia_m._williams	I am so glad we tested this product ahead of time. As a rule we test all battery opperated gifts before we wrap them, these walkie-talkies worked for ab out 10 'feet'... yes I said feet. We gave them to my 2 year old grandson to play with instead of his big brother who got a set of Midlands. Don't waste your money on these..	0
B000065CKT:won't_even_make_lemonade!:steve_silverman_"steve_s"	Got a dud.  Lights flash (constantly) but not a peep out of it.  Has an email address, wrote for suggestions twice, also no response.  But the mail was delivered so I can only assume they're playing dead (or playing with one that works)!  Big let down	0
B00022IBP2:falls_apart:s._tiffany	Like others said the microphone stand broke very easily and the whole toy is not durable at all.  The legs and the stool do not stay together whatsoever.  My son has to sit with it on his lap to play it.  I would not recommend this toy to anyone	0
B000JSUBUM:unusable_rip-off_of_a_well-known_product:jack_suber	I did not buy this from Amazon but sought it out here so I could vent about this outrageous product (that's 'outrageous' in its traditional meaning, that it outrages me).	0
B00004W60G:disappointing:green-gene	I had high hopes for this game, but played it with a friend last night and was appalled at the number of confusing questions and just plain incorrect answers.  For example, one question asks, "Which of these animals is not found exclusively in South America:  (a) chinchilla, (b) sloth, (c) guinea pig, (d) spring buck".  Ruling out zoos, my friend reasoned that since zillions of kids in the US have pet guinea pigs, the answer must be C.  Alas, no; the correct answer is "(d) spring buck" with no explanation.  Did they mean animals in their natural habitat?  We aren't sure.  The question is not clearly written.  Another question asks, "The word `berserk' is derived from:  (a) a Norse god; (b) the German for `crazy life', (c) a tropical plant".  I read this to my friend and said, "None of these is the right answer."  The word `berserk' comes from the Germanic branch of the language tree and means `bear-shirt'.  The game says the correct answer is "a Norse god.  In Norse mythology, the god `Berserker' always fought in a state of frenzy."  There is no such Norse god.  Who wrote these questions?  One of the aspects of trivia games that I enjoy is the prospect of learning something in the process of playing; this game concerns me because I do not know which answers are incorrect.  From a learning standpoint, the badly written questions and poorly researched answers make this a frustrating and intellectually dangerous game.	0
B000BLJ8CO:nice_music_but_overall_one_disappointment_after_another.:t._l._miller_"horror_novelist"	When putting together the mobile section of this item, I was very disappointed in its flimsiness. It looks like just a few knocks will cause the screws to break from the plastic.	0
B0009JOT9U:password_journal_disappointment:k._graham	I got this product for my daughter.  The password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize.  My daughter often could not make the journal open. After a frunstrating week or two, she stopped playing with it altogether	0
B000EUMONC:didn't_work_very_well:k._jacobs	My son was excited to get this for christmas.  After we opened it and put it together it just never worked the way it was designed.  The arrows launcher never held the arrows.  As soon as you tried to load them they would fly out.  The shuriken launcer was cumbersome and difficult to use.  He pretty much gave up on it after a few days and now it's gathering dust in our closet.	0
B00008ZCEF:do_not_waste_your_money!:j._smith_"stay_at_home_mommy."	This toy barely gets used in our house. It has a very low to the floor design, my 18 month old daughter has to hunch just to play with it. The sounds and characters are cute, but clunky and not very realistic. I am very dissatisfied with this purchase, not worth the investment. If you are looking for a fisher price doll house for your youngster, I would suggest checking out: Fisher Price - My First Dollhouse. It has a higher design with more realistic characters, not so clunky. I wish we would have purchased this one instead	0
B000B7P340:it's_ok:kelly_a._kelleher	There are lots of little pieces, and the rules are a bit complex. I played it with my nephews ages 7 and 5 and they both had a hard time staying interested for the length of the game. However they have both asked to play it since, so they must like something about it :	0
B00083HIW2:mixed_feelings_about_it:mom_of_two_"crystal"	As in my title I have mixed feelings about this toy. My children both have the original color version of the VideNow. I thought I would upgrade them to the newer version. They have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well. In fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in. There is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't accidently turn off while watching. But it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often. I can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it just gets left on! I am very dissapointed in this. The kids really enjoyed their Color versions and I feel I shouldn't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. However, even with it's faults my kids still enjoy them. My kids don't watch a lot of TV and prefer the shorter pvds to the long Dvds. I prefer that too. That way I can say they can watch one show and know they won't be watching for an hour or more. If you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it. If your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you	0
B000EMGCWE:shake_and_go_do_not_go_that_far..:s._kennel_"shopping_mom"	I bought the race cars to go on the speed and go racetrack.  After shaking the cars, they do not even go around the racetrack once!! My boys still love the cars becasue of the way they look and the noise that they make. And boy do they make alot of noise! They love to push the cars around the racetrack.  It frustrates me becasue I bought several of these shake and go racecars that do not go around the track and use alot of batteries	0
B0008FXVS0:i_wish_i_had_read_these_reviews_before_i_bought_one!!:alanna_j._shevak_"lansieking"	I couldn't agree more about this product. It's appalling how badly made it is. The concept is very cute - a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die-cast vehicles. My 2.5 year-old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it! The bridge on the right doesn't properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly. It's also a battle to get the tool box to connect together. My son always wants to play with it, but I can't cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart. I think this toy will have to mysteriously "disappear" one night while he is sleeping. They should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money!	0
B000LPN9CK:not_worth_it:c._hubert	We bought this item for our son's birthday. We assembled it exactly as shown in the directions.  The cars do not launch properly into the loop - we have yet to have one car make it through the entire track. Also, when you place cars to "launch" and "crash" they shoot clear across the room. One knocked our daughter in the chest!	0
B0007WX1HA:to_the_girl_in_egypt...:fred_j._wuebker_"actually,_it's_katie"	Here in America, Lindsay Lohan is what many call a conspiracy. Lindsay Lohan is NOT  a "beloved collector's item". She's a bulimic spoiled brat.	0
B0001GBSBI:cute_but_tips_over_too_easily:a_reader	This bike may be cute, but it tips over too easily.  My daughter was on it for 10 minutes and she tipped over several times, then would not go on it. I returned it to the store, after reading on this site that it is obviously a common problem with this bike.	0
B000B6MKNS:polly_pocket_sticker_maker:michelle_s._biseinere	My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere.  They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get.  I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter	0
B000CCEV4C:not_what_i_expected:cajuncutie	This Suduko handheld game was not user friendly. I returned it for a full refund	0
B000EGETF2:poor_battery_life_and_faulty_cars:george_pluck	The McQueen car went first. Motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation. This, after about two weeks of play.	0
B000067K0K:disappointed...:jvhh	At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working. Because the case does not stay open on its own, there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here.	0
B00012BSOY:only_good_for_older_kids:a._black	This stuff is greasy and hard to wipe off tables and fingers.  It's good for older kids who can keep their fingers on the paper but not good for little ones who smush their fingers into the wax and get it all under their finger nails on the table, chairs and walls.	0
B000H87RYW:cheap_table:gugaslc_"gugaslc"	After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund	0
B000JM09M8:fish_killer:red_raven_"red_raven"	Followed all directions, added fish, within hours the fish were "sleeping" on the bottom of the tank. Luckily they had not entered the never ending sleep so I took them out putting them in a bowl of water and after an hour they started getting better.  Changed the water in the tank this time using distilled water, added fish, 3 hours later they were lying motionless on the bottom.  took them out and put them in another bowl of water and they got better. Something is seriously wrong with this tank.  Bought regular plastic tank at the pet store added fish and guess what... they are doing great!  Do not put fish in the shark tank.  They will die	0
B00083HKUM:did_not_live_up_to_expectaion:c._grills	The go-cart is much smaller that it appeared to be. My 2 year old barely fits. These is no reverse and it is a sit in toy. So the child has to get completely out to turn around, or you have to follow them around. The steering column is not straight so the steering wheel has to be sideways to drive straight. All together it is not a very impressive to. My daughter enjoys it very much but I should not have got rid of her Lil' Quad.	0
B0006N013M:just_doesn't_work_at_all:pauline_dolan	This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason.	0

B000639LHY:fills_up_with_water,_takes_ages_to_dry:leighann_"leighann1001"	My daughter had a drink and wet doll that she could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you couldn't empty all the water out, it still leaked everywhere. I got rid of it hoping she wouldn't notice. Well, she did, so a new "doll I can give a bath to" was on her Christmas list. I wanted to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water. Like the dolls I had as a child. I thought this would be it since the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes. Wrong. It has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get waterlogged. The water all (I hope) drains out of the bottom of the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing. Then you have to let the torso drip dry. Last night after bathtime, my daughter wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle, but couldn't because she was still wet.	0
B000HB33YM:worthless:r._spano	It didn't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots.  Don't waste your money	0
B000ERVMJ2:poor_design_and_doesn't_make_much_sense:mommy_of_two_"db"	Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing	0
B00027173K:too_flimsy:a._copeland	this was a christmas present and it continues to fall apart. the archways do not stay on them. too expensive for what you really get. i ended up putting most of it away except for the center cake piece and the cats. I would not buy it	0
B00001R3WO:this_is_a_big_project!:alnem2	I just finished the World's Largest Crossword Puzzle last night.  It's been one heck of a project--approximately equivalent to 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles.  I'm going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall--it really is something to behold when it's all done.  But it's also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance.	0
B00023C40E:ok,_but_not_great:j._douglas_bennett	We bought this for our snowboarding 11-year-old son. Being used to Playstation and Gamecube, he wasn't impressed with the graphics and control of the characters is very clunky. It's a cool concept-- but it needs more time in development	0
B000ETRERO:good_god,_save_your_money!_!_!_!:gayle_l._edmond_"diverse_music_lover"	This game is one hot mess.  I bought it for my Mom for Christmas.  We decided to play the 2 player game thinking it would be fun.  Well, the word my Mother used to describe it is "EXCRUCIATING".  This was the slowest and most boring thing I've ever played.  There is at least a 10 second pause between EACH function (choosing a case, opening the case, Howie giving you directions, taking turns, looking at your opened case. . .you name it).  Each time you switch back to the other player, THE SCREEN LITERALLY GOES BLACK!  You only see the suitcase girls in the beginning and the end.  When a case is opened, you only see two arms, breasts and the case!  When it is your turn to pick a case, there is COMPLETE SILENCE as you scroll - and I use the term loosely - up and down to pick a number.  For a "video game" which you assume to move quickly, you'd better set aside at lease an hour to play it.  You will be exhausted when you're through.  We suggest they go back to the drawing board and stop with all the pauses, play some theme music when you are choosing your case, show the girl who opens your case, have the audience clap - ANYTHING!!!!!!!!  If you buy this game, you only have yourself to blame. P.S.  I won $750,000 and didn't even care, I was just glad it was over	0
B00020QJJE:disappointed_with_smithsonian:michelle_phillips	I purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present.  I was significantly disappointed.  With this item having the Smithsonian name on it, I expected better construction.  While trying to assemble the item, the plastic cracked on the one.  The tubes and caps were so loose that I was afraid the bugs would get out into my house.  I put silicone around the extremely loose ones.  However, I did not seal everything so the critters could breathe.  For the price, there are other similar items out there with better construction	0
B00004U3G6:plastic_plywood:alaynia_j._mcgill_"manager"	This says it is a wooden dollhouse but is not worth the money - is cheesy looking and cheaply made	0
B0007YDES4:too_loud!:s._skidmore	I bought this toy for my son for Christmas.  I thought he would enjoy the toy because he already likes to place balls and other items into baskets and he likes rattles.  Unfortunately the toy ended up being a disappointment because it is SO LOUD!  It scares him everytime I turn it on and there is no way to control the volume.  I know lots of kid toys are loud, but I have never heard one as loud as this one.	0
B000E850G2:not_endorsed_by_the_original_design_engineer_of_the_vurtego_pro:j._sequeira_"jammer_21"	I am an active 48 year old and I own a Vurtego Pro Pogo stick. I ride motocross and I mountain bike regulary and I like the exercise and fun factor it offers. I chose the Vurtego Pro after doing some online research and I am totally pleased with the performance. The guys who designed and developed the Vurtego Pro and Fit sticks were looking for a way to offer a more affordable model for beginers and people looking for a fun but still high quality stick. The Power model came up short of their extpectations and they pulled thier endorsement due to quality and safety concerns.  For the money the Power Pogo is a fairly decent pogo stick but its not going to stand up to the abuse and demands of an expert or extreme pogo stick rider. It takes allot of effort and experience to go 6' or higher on any pogo stick. I am pretty good at mine, after about a month of use I am getting up in the 3' range and bouncing 500 plus consecutive times in a session before taking a break and going for another session or two, a great workout! I have pogo stick experience and can pull off most of the basic tricks, I consider myself a beginner to intermediate at the most. I doubt that I will ever reach the six foot level at my age, but that was never my goal. I know that the people at Vurtego are still working to develope a model that will be safe and affordable for those looking for a capeable, high quality and durable stick. If your looking to go 6' and pull off serious stunts I would buy the orignal Vurtego Pro or the Fit model for a great workout. If you are looking for a little less I would wait for the next version that the  Vurtego people will offer and endorse. I personally would avoid this one.	0
B000AR84B0:absolute_waste_of_money_-_deserves_zero_stars:timothy_b._dereg	I would give this kit zero stars if I could. The instructions say that it takes 6-8 weeks for the seeds to sprout. I kept them in moist peat and warm temperatures for over three months after the recommended period of refrigeration.  Not a single seed sprouted. I finally had to throw out the whole kit when mold took over. Complete waste of time and money.	0

You cant really tell when Superman is hit because his head barely leans back. You have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets -and it seems rigged that Supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth, justice and the American way. Again, Cool figures weak cheap playability	0

B0001NE7F0:questions_too_obscure:mary_jones	In order to answer the questions in this edition of Trivial Pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of SNL.  Most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family, who have watched SNL since it began, and who quote it frequently.  I was very disappointed in this game.	0
B0006NDBNE:be_prepared_to_rebuild:todd	Very disappointed with the quality.  Took 2 hours to put together then disintegrated as I was carrying it from the shop to the christmas tree.  I was not happy having to put it back together early Christmas morning.  Be prepared to use extra tape, glue, nails and screws to hold the contraption together.  The stairway is a joke and I threw it away as it is only held in with two 3/4" pegs.  We'll see if it survives Christmas Day.	0
B000J01U2I:recall_is_hard_to_get_a_hold_of,_my_'smart_balls'_don't_work_and_c/d_don't_work:s._gale	Not the best toy I own.  I wanted to send it back after a week because the letter C wouldn't say it's name.  After a while it started working, but then D stopped.  According to the online demo the balls will say their colors when dropped in the chute.  Mine never have done this.	0
B0006OJ03S:dont_buy_it:paula_lee_"miserable66"	Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price.	0

It was fun for a few days...until he went head over heels on a very small slope in our yard.  The toy landed on top of him, with his neck rolled and pinned under the toy.  He was so terrified of it after that, he refused to get back on.  It has been stored in our basement and will be sold at the next yard sale.  Save your money - this toy is too tipsey for toddlers and way too fast for them to control the steering	0
B000HVVIJY:children_sewing_machine_do_not_purchase:valerie_m._millet	My daughter wanted a Sewing Machine for her 8th Birthday. I thought it would be a good introduction to sewing instead of using my adult machine, but it was a mistake because the Singer Lockstitch Sewing Machine only worked once, when we first tried and this was it. I tried to work on it but it is so cheaply made that no wonder it doesn't work more than once. Unfortunatelly by the time we realize, I could not return it, because the box was in the garbagge.	0
B0007ZH8XA:immediately_frustrated:r.k.l.	I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!	0
B0007XTNDU:turns_backwards:rebekah_bowser	I didn't know you had to line up the arrows on the motor part so we installed it incorrectly and it rotated counterclockwise; my husband took the whole thing apart and reversed the battery terminals so that it would turn clockwise, then it worked just fine.  The instructions don't mention that you have to align the motor to the terminals in a certain fashion or it will turn backwards.  But once you get it lined up right it works fine with Hershey's syrup.  a Great starter fountain for my chocaholic 2nd grader	0
B0007W8FCQ:incredibly_poor_quality!!:d._zamora	Wow!  This toy was made as cheap as possible.

B000067QXC:both_good_and_bad...:g._bilotti	I bought 8 sets of these mats to completely cover my son's playroom.  Of the 8, there were 6 perfect sets.  The other 2 had VERY rough sections that caused major irritation on my son's knees.  When I contacted the company, they gave me a VERY hard time about the issue and basically said they wouldnt do anything about replacing those mats until they received them back and could do an investigation as to how this could have happened.  They kept saying that they had never seen anything like this before as though I was making the issue up.  In the end, I was SO unhappy with their attitude that I returned all 8 sets and went with another brand.  Be careful and check the quality of the sets that you receive!	0
B000A32OCO:too_heavy:deanna_meyerhoff	Lego is a great product, unfortunately this one's just a little too ambitious. My son fell in love with this and begged for it for Chanukah, but once we got it put together it wouldn't stay together to play with. It's great to make smaller planes with, but the original plane just fell apart under it's own weight.	0

B00021Z1UQ:great_idea,_poorly_constructed:dayflowr	My sone LOVES this trike, but has not been able to use it much due to the fact that it keeps breaking. The first one I got had a broken steering wheel lock - it kept slipping into lock position and my son couldn't turn the wheel anymore! So I called Radio Flyer and they graciously sent out a new one(I did not have to provide proof of purchase or anything). On the new one, the parent handle would not lock into place. So I called again and they sent out a new parent handle. I replaced it and everything seemed to work fine until we went up or down a slight incline in which case the handle would come unlocked again. I called Radio Flyer AGAIN. At this point, they are sending a new one which Quality Control is supposed to look over first, and they want the old one back to take a look at it. I really do like this trike, but the quality is not great. If you purchase it and have problems, DEFINITELY call Radio Flyer to get one that works correctly. Don't even bother to return it to the store. Radio Flyer will send parts or replacements free of charge and you don't have to hassle with going back to the store	0
B0002D0F8W:fun_for_a_while:svwhy_"svwhy"	I bought this shopping cart for my 14 month old daughter who absolutely loves her Little Mommy doll.  She enjoyed taking the food out of the shopping cart but when she tried putting it back in the basket fell off the frame and she got quite upset.  Also, at her age it is difficult to get the doll into the seat portion without assistance from mom.  The cart itself also does not turn well when tried to walk with it	0
B00061I3WU:very_cute,_but_arm_broke:ga-reader	My daughters are a little young for this toy and aren't that into it yet. It is very cute, with lots of sweet, tiny, realistic pieces, and I can see it having lots of play value and somewhat educational. However, they made it so the arms are jointed in order that she can hold the baby. Well, my daughter threw the doll on the floor at the doctor's office and the bottom half of the arm fell right off. Even if it hadn't broken, you have to place the arms just right or they look totally strange. This is the least favorite barbie my girls own. If it weren't for the arms, this would be a great toy. Oh, and the back of the dresser is open, so you can't really store the small pieces in it. Not sure why they didn't just close it up to make storage easier.	0
B00008QJ18:wrist,_yes._talkie,_no.:d._oyen	We bought a pair of these thinking they'd be an ideal gift for our 4-year-old nephew. They look great, and the hands-free styling is nice. But it's a good thing we tested them before wrapping the gift. They work terribly. We got very flaky reception with a lot of background noise, and we were less than 40 feet apart.

B00068O26O:don't_waste_your_time_with_this_toilet_lock:debbie_"debbie"	I purchased two of these locks and thought that they were going to work great.  What a big disappointment.  They both continued to fall off within 10 minutes of installing them and they continued to fall off.  I just returned them.  Still looking for something to work.	0
B00004R61N:maybe_it_wasn't_love?:debra_a._adrian_"dainpdx"	This love ball was very un-lovely. The messages would not appear clearly in the window, no matter how I tried turning it over different ways.Maybe it sat too long in the wrong environment before I received it. I put it back in the box and plan to ship it back	0
B00007L12F:you_can_sort_faster_by_hand:some_toys_arent_cool	This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever. If you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins. In mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it, it no longer works	0
B00009OKO3:deceiving!!!:kathleen_m._lennon	If you are looking to add a microphone to your product then just purchase the microphone, NOT the microhpone with these two books.  If you purchase this item then you are LIMITED to these two books!!  If you purchase the microphone you can use ALL microphone enhanced books!!!  My kids LOVE the microphone.  It is great to hear their own voice and sounds.  I give the microphone itself 5 stars	0
B00061I51E:good_for_the_money:m._alsop	I bought these skates for my almost 3 yr old who wants to be like her big sister.  The skates are good overall.  They are easy enough to put on and take off.  The padding inside is nice.  The only drawback I can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting 1 changes by itself to setting 2 which lets the wheels roll.  I am not sure if I just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates.  I will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting.	0
B00000ISR7:didn't_work_after_first_month:rebecca_bailey	I bought this for my son's first birthday.  He loved it!  But, after only a month it stopped quacking and he lost most interest in it.  He still plays with it a little bit, but not like when it made noise.  I wouldn't have wasted my money if I had known the batteries would only last a month	0
B0000AVBPM:broken_also:seattle_sarah	I was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway. It was a lot of fun! While it worked. We experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... I appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to? It's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it. I would not buy it again. If you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first	0
B00005BXI7:disappointing:bernard_shiner_"bernard"	It says that it works with vibration, maybe if you are dancing on a trampoline. The kids are not really that impressed	0
B00005NZVW:penguins_missing!!!!_how_disappointing!:sb's_mom	Not sure what happened, but I received my daughter's gift in the mail today. There were no penguins in the box, and but the packaging looked original with no tampering. Beware, if you're ordering from Imaginarium! What a disappointment this was for us	0
B000IEVFES:broken_within_minutes:c._howard	My title says it all.  The black balls fell off of the sticks within a couple minutes of normal use; therefore the toy was also a choking hazard.  The balls wouldn't even glue back on effectively because the ball openings were clearly too large for the sticks they were matched with.  Cheaply made and potentially dangerous	0
B000IFVQIC:horrible---huge_waste_of_money:jeffrey_j._borgohff	We purchased two of these safes for our daughters for Christmas and they both broke within 3 weeks.  Don't waste your money!!!!	0
B00083HIHM:fun_but_very_fragile:c._d._mitchell	I bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube.  I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle.  However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off.  We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well.	0
B000L3C1K8:disney_dump_don't_buy!!!:sad_cars_fan	My son waited 8 hours to play with his "Lighning Mcqueen" only to be disappointed. This thing is way to expense to only jerk around my kitchen floor!  My only hope is I can return this dumpy car because my son tore into the box with excitement!  Shame on Disney.  DO NOT BUY	0
B000246LL6:picky_moms_don't_buy_it!:stephanie_j._thiess_"mommy_and_me_bellydancer"	If you are a picky mom like me...i.e you DO NOT let your child watch "sponge bob" or "Scooby Doo" and you maybe even read Mothering Magazine, DO NOT get this book.	0
B000F0GXBA:mazu_kan't:m._silver_"mooktoys"	My 9-yr old received this toy as a birthday present. Of course it looks COOL.  Against my better judgement of immediately returning it, we opened, played for 10 mins, got frustrated, and will now return it.  The boys were VERY patient adusting the straps properly to their bodies (it took 20 mins).  Seems like good quality wiring - I was afraid they'd pull at it while strapping in, but it didn't.  Must stand 10 feet away from each other (a good thing!).  The punch/block sounds are cool, but the boys got very confused trying to figure out who scored, what the lights on chestplate meant, etc.  It's possible that you must go slow and perhaps wait for 1 player to throw punch.  Then block.  Difficult for excited boys to be so choreographed and patient!  Block with opposite hand of partner's throwing punch hand WHILE squeezing a button on palm strap of your other hand.  There's some maneuvering to get used to.  But within 10 minutes, all sound/power went down, and we couldn't get it to recharge/work again.  It's supposed to recharge quickly so I don't know what the problem is.  Instructions say when nothing happens, change batteries...but 10 mins into game?   Hmmm.  Too frustrating for all the effort	0
B00008ZCDQ:not_very_good_at_all...:d._m.	The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the "microsope".	0

B0009F4YRG:all_the_fun_of_a_grocery_store_loudspeaker:gaius_ingerheim	I played this at a friend's party, and it was a wretched party game. It basically consists of a person reading the puzzle in a monotone voice and allowing everyone else to attempt to figure it out. It is incredibly monotonous, and a throughly awful game to play at a party.	0
B000068EY1:wannabe_makes_candy_in_2_minutes:	it makes cotton candy in 30 minutes because  it has to warm for 10 minutes then it have to put put the suger in the middle then wait til becomes webby then wait agian to turn it off.	0

B000B6R088:not_worth_$35:e._matthews	We got this when our son was about 4 months old and at first he did love it. There was a slight rubber\plastic smell with everything in the Tub Time tub but we thought it would fade with time. Well six months later the smell was still there and our son ended up stop playing with most of the bath toys except the squirting bath buddies.We did all the precautionary steps to keep the bath toys clean yet they grew mold in a very short amount time.	0
B000F901F0:frustrating!!!:michael_bentivenga_"big_kid"	The game has a nice concept, IF IT WORKED. I've been trying since christmas(over 3 months) to connect this game to the internet to update it for my kids and finally was able to update the firmware today. Something that you will have to do to be able to get to the virtual worlds,BUT THE WEB SITE IS ALWAYS DOWN!!!!! EXPERANCING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS!!!  and the nice window that pop's up on the home page from the Chief, asking for suggestions goes to a bad link!!!	0
B00083HOXA:disappointed_with_quality:amazoncomwoman_"amazoncomwoman"	The seller shipped promptly but the merchandise disappointed ... materials/workmanship not so hot; my husband stuck his hand all the way through a side panel while setting it up.  Since there was no taking it back from our 2-year-old after he saw it, he now has a tent with an extra window in it.  Child is delighted with the toy, parent is not delighted with durability	0
B000GP4NCA:do_not_buy!!:kdc_"kc"	Do not buy at this price. Ridiculous!!!  Just bought this car on ebay for 8.99.  And bought another very rare one("Mr The King") for $10.00.  These sellers are nuts!	0
B0009S5U2G:not_good_at_all:c._bratt	i hate to write a bad review- i think it's actually the first one i've ever written. this was a gift from my husband's work christmas party for our 2-year old. the extension on the pole is a stiff plastic piece and doesn't stay extended so that you can catch the fish; it folds back on itself. so our son wasn't able to catch anything with it. it would be better if the extension didn't bend at all, but just stayed in one place, and even if it did that i wouldn't buy it. it's more fun to have a pole with a string so you can reel it in	0
B00005YXWD:limited_access_to_refills_is_very_disappointing:jeri_feaster_"sees_mountains"	I got this for my 6 and 3 year olds.  They both really like it (3 year old needs help remembering which letter goes with which color).  Of course they used up the 8 designs in the first 2 days.  Hasbro.com does carry refill packs, but the website is so bad that it is hard to find them.  Don't bother searching on the word "refill"! There is a form you can print out and then mail in, but this is kind of ridiculous both in waiting and in price.  The form is under replacement parts, but it doesn't even identify what you are buying.  After digging around, I  deduced that it was refill sheets: I think 10 pictures for 6.99 including some bonus pegs?  There is an after-market web site where you can instantly purchase downloadable pictures 13 for 4.95, but you actually print them (including the black background!) on your own printer with your own ink!  Ouch.  Hasbro really disappointed me on this one.  They shuld have included at least 20 pictures with the item and should sell 40 packs replacements online for about 5.00.  Thumbs up to the toy.  Thumbs down to Hasbro.  Also, the light bulb on mine flickers all the time as if it is about to short out	0
B0009J8PNQ:blaze_of_destruction:	This is a great starter deck for any duelist.  With just a few booster packs this deck will become unstopable!  After only a few days of practice with this deck I had beaten all of my friends who had been dueling for months.	0
B00005NIUV:ok_but_not_the_best:stacey_bujalski_"emma's_mom"	I bought this for my daughter's 1st birthday after seeing an ad for the entire set of Chicco Happy Garden products.  My daughter loves the Little Tikes set that is at her daycare and this looked similar but much cuter.  The eggplant has been a bit of a disappointment.  She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest.  Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.  It just doesn't rock much.  I can't imagine a child over 1 wanting to play with it.  The eggplant has very little curve to it and is pretty boring. I would stick to the Little Tikes set.	0
B00000JRH0:glad_i_didn't_buy!:rena_k._goins	Thanks to those of you who reviewed this..I WON'T waste my money.  I too remember the good old days when the clasp was metal and you could load up the case and it stayed shut.  I'll stick to plastic tubs that click closed and allow you to see inside.  Too bad Barbie/Mattel is missing a great money-maker by going cheap on quality	0
B0006NDCLU:lots_of_fun,_but_did_not_last:kim_"artistmom"	My 7 year old son received the Giga Ball for Christmas. It was a big hit. He and all of his cousins had a great time with it for several hours. Unfortunately, the very next day, it pretty much fell apart. I didn't expect it would last very long, but had hoped that it would last more than one day	0
B0001NE9ZS:hardly_hardy_-_not_worth_your_money.:disappointed_brother	My little brother received this toy as a present, and constantly had problems just keeping the toy together. He barely had any fun with it, since it fell apart most of the time. My brother is generally good with toys, and he has fun with practically anything, but this toy proved to be the exception. You could buy something much more fun for the same amount of money	0
B00005BHNP:musical_hands_mat:penelope	This toy does not work.  I do not recommend it.  There is no quality to the workmanship.  A total disappointmen	0
B000FKOXYE:didn't_work_when_arrived:nonfat_chai_latte_lover	I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Unfortunately it didn't work when it arrived, but fortunately my sister in law was able to take it to a local discovery store and exchange it for one that worked fine	0
B000089GEC:no_storage:bj_"mom_of_boys"	It is just like Mr. Potato Head except not as many pieces.  There aren't very many options to dress SBSP, but he is always a fun toy.  After a year of play, he is a little torn at the edges, but overall in good shape.	0
B00005BYQ2:must_have_gotten_a_faulty_one...doesn't_function_properly:jen_jen_"jenny"	After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.	0

B0009I6RFK:mere_words_cannot_plumb_the_depths_of_my_hatred.:k._mcneece_"pink_pimpernel"	Ok, maybe that's a bit strong, but this is hands down our most hated toy (by the adults, and the kids are plenty frustrated, too).  We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.).  Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time.  The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse.  After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before	0
B000I62M3Y:choking_hazard:j._lapic	Although these keys are one of my 14 month old son's favorite toys, one of the buttons came off and fell into the shell of the remote control.  It was the larger button to turn on the light and he would have likey choked on it had it fallen into his mouth.  If you purchase these, be sure to supervise your child playing with them at all times!  However, I would suggest not purchasing them	0
B0000669F7:my_daughter_really_enjoys_this_tent:tom	I agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely loves it.  First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick.  I went to Home Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great.  My daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and everything else did move it around.  I bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place, works great.  I think we paid $19 for this at Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets.  If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent, you will probably be disappointed	0
B0006PJPBE:great_idea_-_poor_construction:jgb	We received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals, barns, etc.  He LOVES the tent; however, the construction was so poorly thought out that he cannot touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him!  There is no way to anchor it to the floor (weights, etc.) to keep it from toppling over.  The sides have no stabilization whatsoever.	0
B000ILH7KW:yuck-_ours_grew_mold:k._schwarz	My 3-year-old son liked Floam because of the goop factor, but unfortunately the goop the little foam pellets are suspended in seems to be a GREAT medium for growing MOLD.  This happened to us twice (despite clean hands/work space) so we gave up on it entirely.	0
B0001WUWR8:the_machina_doesn't_work_at_all.:mother_"kasia"	It is a waste of money and a big disappointment.  I will be returning it.	0
B00007BKUO:no_bounce_for__the_buck:robert_crupi_"memom"	These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and  a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous.  Defintely would not recommend.	0

B0009HXWCM:train_cannot_stay_on_track_for_even_a_few_seconds!:j._leander	I would give this toy a 0 if it was an option.  When you unfold the tiny track and get the train going, it can't even make one corner turn without coming off the track!  The train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track.  This is very frustrating for my kids and I cannot believe they even put this on the market?  You can't even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it.  I am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is.	0
B0006216GY:what_a_waste_of_money_-_and_what_a_mess!:carie_m._dobson	Don't waste your time with this thing.  By the time we invested in the toy, the batteries, etc. we had quite a few dollars into it... for about 15 minutes of fun.  The toy can't just be set down on a table, so when my son actually gone bored with it (to my shock because he LOVES bubbles) he tried to set it down and it spilled the remaining GOLD solution all over.  Yuck.  Mommy promptly threw the toy in the trash.	0
B00004WGML:don't_buy_this_toy!:terri_hughes	This toy is TERRIBLE!!  My daughter got this for Christmas, and it only frustrates her.  It takes too many cranks to get the clown to pop up, and she can't get the lid to stay shut without my help.  The "music" is terrible.  I would definitely not recommend this toy.	0
B0002EO78K:do_not_waste_your_money:g._salazar_"gigi"	I purchased this toy for my 3yr old in December last year. He has not been able to use it since we have not been able to find ANY products (discs, carrying case etc) for the videonow. I have called the company several times. Everything is always unavailable and I do check on a regular basis. My son has been watching black and white discs recently from his older brother on the machine so he will get some use out of it. It was a good idea but the company leaves a lot to be desired. If you make a product make sure that there are enough discs. It is simply a waste of money and time. I cannot continue going on line and checking a couple of times every week. I hope this info factors in in your decision to purchase this toy	0
B00074FY6E:an_ok_model:samuel_b._callejo	This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's.	0
B0007ZKN8W:strings_do_not_work:b._hake	We bought this item for my Daughter's Christmas present and the strings do not work at all.  All it does is play the 3 songs, and the microphone works.  But the other functions (anything to do with the strings) do not work at all.  We bought this at Toys R Us and we're taking it back tomorrow.  As I can see from the reviews (which I wish I'd read earlier), we'll be getting a different brand of guitar.  These seem faulty as a rule.  Do not buy this	0
B0000CDZDM:pharaonic_guardian_is_awesome!:brianna_"bri_t85"	This is probably one of the best booster packs out there. Every monster that comes in the pack has an effect. Effect monsters can be very useful. Not to mention that my very first Pharaonic Guardian pack came with a secret rare! That is one of only two of the most rare cards in the whole pack! Even the common cards are great. Such as Giant axe mummy or the Gravekeeper cards! Your deck cannot be complete without this booster pack! I highly suggest this pack	0
B0006M1AMY:dont_waste_your_money:r._brushia	Ok, my kid loves it.  But, after seeing it in person, I cant believe how much I was charged for list little plastic toy.  Cost is way over excessive.  Strongly suggest saving your money, unless money is no object	0
B0001XNTJA:poor_quality:caroleann_"caroleann"	This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one	0
B00000J4SI:a_big_waste_of_money:lucinda_clare_ogburn_"gray's_mommy"	I was really excited about this toy. I was very forgetful when it came to putting my son on his tummy, so I thought this would be a great toy for him to  have some good quality tummy time on. Wrong. He could care less about this toy. The second I'd lay him in front of it he would just roll onto his back. He was five months old when we bought it, and it is just sitting there. He STILL loves his Gymini and he is six months old now. Also, by the third day the aquarium had sprung a leak..which apparently has happened to almost everyone who  has bought this thing. Do not  purchase this toy, it takes up too much space, and it's a waste of money. Baby could care less about it	0
B0001KU8RY:magnetix:shawna_hogberg	My kids love Magnetix, but I am unable to order them online because you do not ship to Canada. This problem occurs a lot. Someone should fix that.

B000066544:this_game_sucks!:brett_tompkins	This is the worst game I have ever played.  It was so bad that we didn't even finish.

Okay we took them out of the package, and had to rearrange the batteries 82 times before it would even respond to the water!!! When we placed it in the pool all it did was go on its side,in circles. Nothing was "realistic" about these things!!!! I should add that it was not just this one, but all of them!!!Do not waste your money or time buying these!!	0

B0007R72AW:poorly_designed:kelly_a._ellin	I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went.	0
B000FNL6IM:bad_toy!!:toy_mom_"toy_mom"	I bought this for my 5 year old and as another reviewer said....he would have to be double his size for it to fit (he wears a size 5-6)....and the items attached to it keep falling off.  We had to Duct tape it together to fit him because of course I would rather have returned it...but it was his favorite present!!!  It frustrates him a lot so I do not see him sticking with it!	0
B00005M8UP:thomas_trains_do_not_fit_in_case:charlieson_"father"	The wooden Thomas the Tank Engine trains do not fit in this case.  The case is way to small for the trains to fit in.  I would not recommend anyone buying this item.  It is just a brightly painted metal box, that doesnt serve any useful purpose.  The manufactor should be ashamed for false advertising.	0
B00099EBH0:don't_waste_your_money..._find_an_older_sit_n_spin!!!:kayesto	My daughter plays with an older round version sit and spin at daycare alot. All the kids like it there. She got the Simon Says version for Christmas from her aunt and it pretty much sucks. She tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale. My recommendation to Playskool would be to go back to the original design - a round sit n spin, no sound - just pure and simple fun	0

B000068DMD:clearance:lea_bartram	I got this on clearance like 2 years ago. I new it would not hold up. I had many kids on it because I do home daycare. My rule was only 3 kids at a time. The bigger kids could only go on 2 at a time. It got 3 holes which I patched. They even took naps in it. I must of had It for about 6 months and only keep it up for like a week at a time. My problem was it was hard to store. I had to leave it inflated some and pushed it in back of my closet. Finaly one of the big kid did a big belly flop on it and popped the seem. No way was that fixable. If I ever find it on clearance again I would buy it but not for what they are asking for it. Not worth it if it will break in a couple of months	0
B0007XIDIG:don't_let_anyone_kid_you:_this_game_is_worthless!:kenneth_j._walker_"kwalker126"	I support the comments that others make: this game is so poorly designed, it is laughable. I cannot imagine that the designers or writers even sat down to play the game once.  Forget trying to follow the directions; they left out many important rules.  The board doesn't work, especially the way the pieces fit into it, and what a terrible ending with a spinner that doesn't even work like a spinner.  What is up with that?  Forget this game	0
B00004TFGH:fun_with_two_glass_plates:	Painting the plates is a fun activity because you can be creative. The only problem is that you have to be careful or they could crack or break	0
B00000J4BN:need_more_information_on_purchase:ralph_chilelli	This seemed to be well put together and would do the job fine except it was not stated anyware that I saw as to the weight the zip line was for.  Rated at only 100 pounds was not enough of a weight limit for this child.  This information should be published in the advertisment	0
B00004S7NC:worst_lunchbox_ever:jon_langbert_"triplets_dad"	My son is a Thomas fanatic.  This lunchbox didn't last one week without one of the legs snapping off, so it wouldn't stand up.  Then a few weeks later, he dropped it and the handle shattered.  Total waste of money.  It's a shame - it has a nice storage box in front, but the quality is below even what I'd expect from a Chinese sweatshop	0
B000A7S596:wow_is_all_i_can_say:brenda_hankins	Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't "wear that to a club" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, "Do me now." There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now	0
B000E6ELLE:get_your_earplugs_at_the_same_time:thomas_f._harper_jr.	Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking.	0
B000EQHJI6:piece_of_crap:tanya,_"mom_to_3_girls"	I bought this for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  She played the sound game.  She always got the answer correct, but 60-70% of the time the bear still said it was incorrect.  The rest of the family tried it and it did the same thing.  Therefore, this is not a learning toy and it is no fun.  After trying a few times and the bear telling my daughter she was incorrect when she actually was, she decided she hated the thing and didn't ever want to play with it again.  I took the thing back to the store and got a refund	0
B0001GBRNM:durable_until_it_is_taken_out_of_the_package:robert_mccain	I bought this for my 7 year old son. It did not take long before the A and B buttons became stuck in the down position. The games were not that challenging for a 7 year old. But he thought it was great when the A and B buttons fouled up, he said it made it more of a challenge. Dad thinks the thing is a piece of crap	0
B000B9RH42:awful:whitney_roberts_"whitney"	worst product ever.  I really trust crayola, but am having doubts after these new outdoor products.  Theyre just terrible- made shotty- they dont work.. i am very disappointed.	0
B0006N8WJ2:very_loud_interactive_planetarium:y._mortichesky	I am very disappointed with this product.	0
B00074FY7S:building_ertl's_darth_vader_tie_fighter:kitbasher_"kitbasher"	As Star Wars kits go, it's better than most. Ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right.	0
B000H6G44I:not_the_greatest:chris&kellyr	I have to agree with the other on here. I got this for my 5yr for christmas and She seemed to enjoy it the first day using it but now It sits in her room plugged into the tv and she hasnt really gotten much use out of it. I was thinking it was going to be more of a mat where you learn to dance from the mat, not oh watch the charaters on the tv and follow thier lead. I tried and didn't think it was all that fun either. I threw the box away and I'm sure I need that to return it. If I could I would get her something else in return that she could use	0
B0009OD1EE:for_short_or_legless_babies:s._brusig_"running_mom"	Like many overhead gym type toys, this one turns out to be for short or legless babies. When my daughter kicks the kickplates, she kicks the toy right away from her (and this is on carpet), and when we brace the toy against something, she kicks herself right out from under the toy. We have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys. Now that we have looked at the box more closely, the baby in the picture has his/her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy. Our daughter is 3 1/2 months old and is already too big for this. On a positive note, this is a very well made toy in all other respects. Looks durable, as are all Chicco toys, and the music and lights are pleasant. Another negative: you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights, and most babies want to pull them. Might be good for a tummy toy, but we're not waiting for that--we'll try the Chicco 3 in 1 gym instead, as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate	0
B0007XIE0I:good_idea,_bad_product:kerowyn	We had it for two weeks then it  broke.  The screen flashes on and off for no reason.  Nothing happened to it--it just started doing that.  Very weird.  No online support available from fisher price for this system either.  I bought several games that cannot be played now.  The kids liked it while it lasted though. We also have a Leapster which has lasted us eight months so far.  My boys like it much better too!!  So if you're going to buy a learning system I would recommend the leapster.	0
B00005BY3W:it's_a_little_leaky:bbboysmom	These trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them.  They each have been through two sets with the same result...the water leaks out after you've had them awhile.  They are not worth the money.  I highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars.  This was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a Thomas product.	0
B000G2FOLC:waste_of_money:sophie's_mom	This was a waste of money!!  I bought these for my daughter Sophie, who is 23 months old, as a Valentines Day gift.  The crayons are very small and the holder makes them appear to be bigger.  The crayons all kept falling out of their holders and my daughter didn't enjoy playing with them.  I WAS NOT IMPRESSED and DO NOT RECOMMEND these to anyone.	0
B000EPFENE:poorly_made!:m._bell	I don't usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy.  I agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my 4-year-old daughter!  Also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time.  All that being said, she loves it	0
B0002HYD5E:very_small:c._love_"mom"	This is VERY small. It's too small for a play kitchen. And you only get one not two like is pictured	0
B000BCEJIQ:disappointing:nora	The horse doesn't stay hooked on to the carriage too well. It always comes apart. It's a pain. It's also tricky to get the horse to stay standing. It's cute to look at, but my daughter lost interest in it quickly	0
B00007L5VP:again,_don't_be_deceived_._._._:j._nye	I love legos, however I too was not real impressed with the 50th Anniversary tub. The Lego.com websites description of the contents: Each bucket includes LEGO System bricks in your favorite LEGO colors, plus a handful of gold-colored bricks! Let's be real, we're talking a child's handful, not adult. My daughter was lucky enough to get 8 gold bricks in her bucket. Another child I know got 4, his brother 5. The duplo set I bought had 6. If you're buying for the gold bricks, it's not worth the money	0
B000EJREEC:disappointing_!_:susana_"toy_afficianado"	I was very excited to give this to my 8 year old Pokemon addict. The toy is very cheap - comes in attached plastic and needs to be assembled. When assembled the wing breaks off constantly and the tail doesn't stay together. JUNK!	0
B00099H9RY:oversized_even_for_adult....:adrian_tauer	My wife and I purchased the VIDEONOW XP Interactive Video System for my son this Christmas however when we did Walmart was out of the headphones.  Well I was on Amazon one day and decided to look here.  I ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived.  My 5 year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders.  No matter how we tried that is all they would do.  My 12 year old daughter decided to try them with her mp3 player with the same result!  I am able to wear them however even with my 30 year old head (size 8 1/4) it is still loose.  These are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse.  I would just go ahead and pick up some other company's aftermarket headphones for your child.  If Tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device	0
B00005LACY:too_fragile_-_buyer_beware:toy_king	We looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with. On the surface, the Bruder looked the part. Not as cartoon-looking as some, the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice.	0
B00005CF9P:disappointed:	I purchased this toy based on the excellent reviews it had here at Amazon, it looked also like a fun toy with educational value.  I am very disappointed.  For starters, my son finds it very frustrating that the front pieces for eyes, face & hat can only go on in one order.  He also has trouble pulling the pieces apart once they are together, and he is very dextrous for his age.  Also disappointing is the lack of container to store all the pieces in.  Without this, the blocks are loose in my son's toybox and we can never find all the pieces.  The packaging could easily be redesigned to hold the pieces. All in all, it is not a toy he can sit and play with without assistance, as I had thought it might be.  When he does play with it he enjoys it for about 15 minutes and moves on to something else.  We could have done without this toy under our Christmas tree	0
B000GKYCLW:couldn't_agree_more:alesia_c._carrizales	My son and I have had the same experience with this sticker maker.  Great fun for the first 5-10 stickers but then the sticker role jammed and I did not have the opportunity to give the insides a good look before I was desparately trying to remember how it all went back together.  Too bad...he loved it while it lasted	0
B000AX20P0:a_'no_blaster':emmie_"delawareblue"	To anyone who buys this toy, keep the box and receipt handy.  We may be the odd one out, but we purchased this toy and it didn't work. The legs on Manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball.  This didn't happen.  Rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces 'rapid fire', and if we were lucky one would shoot out - after great effort. It comes with three foam balls, two of which fit, the third was slightly too big and would jam.  Ours is going back to the store today.	0
B000JLWHMY:bad_quality_and_zero_posability:jason_schaeffer_"student"	These figures look pretty decent at first glance but when you take them out of the box you see how bad they really are. My superman broke in half (at the waist) when I took him out of the box! Add that to the fact that there are only an average of six points of articulation on each (only three on Wonder Woman!) and you see that these aren't very high quality figures. Amazo is transparent, which makes no sense whatsoever. He isn't an invisible character. I also don't like that, while superman's S and belt stick out from his uniform, Bizarro's are merely painted on. Only buy this item if you love doomsday and its on sale. It's not worth its list price by a long shot	0

B000065CMK:not_worth_the_time_or_money:vince_l._welter	This playhut was very frustrating for our children. My children enjoyed it when it was left in the slumber position. Our trouble began when we turned it into a tent. The sleeping bag is one side of the tent. It's heavy so it sags leaving little room for children to play. After about ten minutes, the playhut was turned over and on the ground. We returned it..	0
B0006HTQ4S:do_not_waste_your_money!!!:jennifer_p	I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product.  They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke!  You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place?  The whole thing is made terribly.  It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.  None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it.  Bottom line:  this was a complete waste of money	0
B00081RYLE:great_fun_while_it_lasted!:vania_simmons_"datatude"	My 7 year old son got it for Christmas. He was really excited. It is definitely a neat toy. The whole family was into it. However, it only lasted one day. It would no longer charge and I am just going to take it back because I am in no position waste $20.00 just for one day	0
B00019GLOO:doesn't_work:not_my_real_name	Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back	0
B000EMJALE:were_the_questions_for_this_game_written_by_a_man??:irishgal76	I consider myself to be a fairly intelligent individual, and growing up in a family where a Saturday was spent working on the classic car in the garage, or watching football on Sunday, as a female, I know a lot of male stuff.  Even I couldn't answer hardly ANY of the "male" questions, since in this game, men answer questions about womanly stuff, and women answer questions about manly stuff.  We have played it twice now, and even though the men's team has always had 1 male more in touch with his female side than most, the women have always gotten our butts kicked.  It is so one sided it's not even funny.  Even the men were saying, it's not even fun since the game lasts basically 10 minutes.  One of the men said he even had to think twice about some of the "male" questions.  If I were anyone looking to get a good party game, I certainly wouldn't put my money out to get this again.	0
B000E9TCWY:not_worth_the_cost:wjb	Even though I purchased this watch for my grandson for Christmas from another store, it was not worth the money. It does nothing and my grandson abandoned it soon after opening it.  I picked up few pieces from under the sofa last night.   I did see on one toy store's website that there is a deluxe model that is probably better. I wish I had known that before I spend $10 on this piece of junk.	0
B0007WX1IO:f._u._n.:	Very fun I love it is like a dream in a book the wings do fall of but not often. what I say is YES get it	0
B00008O0ZE:don't_buy_..._many_better_choices:mom_of_four	Besides being unstable, this truck is extremely frustrating!  My son is constantly trying to put items in the truck that are too big, and then if he does manage to get a "load" in, he can't get it back out again!!  He has cried in frustration and thrown the toy across the room.  I will be buying him a Fisher Price one for his birthday that actually dumps	0
B000058TJ3:sorry_i_wasted_the_money:mom_to_m_&_a	We loved this pool for three weeks, which is as long as we had it.  This morning, I went out to remove a small amount of rain water from the cover to find that the cover with roughly 1/4" of rain had collapsed the top tier and that we had grass growing up through the bottom of the pool, through plastic.  I could see both happening had the pool sat in one place for a long period of time but this was after less than 24 hours.  A total waste of money	0
B00000J1E2:very_disappointed:joan_cone	The retro-slinky dog, however cute, just doesn't work.  We have tried it on the hardwood floor, the carpet, the title.  We have tried tying a string arounds it's neck, adding a string to it's short stubby string, using the short stubby string to pull it but nothing works.  Our kids 2 & 6 just drag it around laying on it's side--it's just not fun--the head is too heavy and it doesn't move well at all.  I would not buy it.  the Fisher Price doggy we got is very cute and it stays upright, it walks with you and the pull-string is a good length--plus it's cute too!!	0
B000C24F0C:not_what_i_expected:aquashark33@aol.com_"#20_nascarfan"	Hard to follow instructions, I ended up throwing it in a drawer after trying to get the hang of it after 5 minutes. If you want to buy one, I will GIVE you mine :)TOTAL waste of money.	0
B0002TG468:fun_-_for_a_while:fan_of_good_country_music	This toy is great fun but it isn't very durable. Ours broke after about an hour. There was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting. I guess the plastic bladder must have given out. The kids were terribly disappointed	0
B000ICNZR0:watch_child_carefully_:e.b._"concerned_parent"	My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product.	0
B00004SDAQ:monopoly:r._corey_"ranma_saotome"	This was a total change from the boardgame. It is a lot of fun, however I have changed the winning amount, otherwise someone can win the whole game with just one hand	0

B00074ON1Q:terrible_:sparklesparkle	Out of the box we noticed the table top was warped. When you push on one side of it the other pops up.  Definately not suitable for crafts or play.  Returned it that night	0
B00005YXUM:don't_waste_your_money:k._morrison_"arizwldcat"	I picked this up on clearance, but I still think I spent too much.  The older versions were made of much sturdier material; the cards the questions are printed on are very flimsy compared to the original game.  The questions are okay, but many are very obscure.  Trivial Pursuit is a great game and it's one of my favorites, but this version is a dud.  Save your money if you have the older version; it's still a lot more fun to play	0
B000CFI1Q8:not_much_for_the_money:cathytg_"cathytg"	The beads and charms are nice enough, but for the price you get very little with this kit -- only about 50 tiny glass beads and 50 spacers, plus the charms. There's nothing here special enough to justify spending the money -- there are plenty of nicer jewelry kits out there that are more generous with the supplies	0
B000CNCAOO:not_the_swimming_mermaid:w._sammons	I ordered this doll for my 3 year old grandaughter who wanted nothing else for Christmas and even though the stores were sold out, she was sure that Santa could get it for her. When my daughter called to make SURE that I had it actually in hand - I said SURE - I ordered it from Amazon!  After all, the description said that was the SWIMMING Mermaid...that it would swim as soon as you put it in the water.  IT IS NOT!!!!  Like the other lady said - it is Just another Barbie doll in a green dress.  Now I will have to pay a premium to get it from Ebay (where I could have gotten it for less a week ago) and also have to pay express shipping and hope it gets here before Christmas. I will have pay 6 times what I paid for this deception and hope that Santa can get it here in time so that my grandaughter is not disappointed.  Beware of this seller!  I see that he has now removed the word swimming from the description.  Believe me - it was there before	0
B0000E2X4Z:best_to_look_to_another_brand:marsha_wood_wirtel	We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years.  After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked.  And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped.  Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.	0
B0002D0F8M:for_use_with_dolls??_i_think_not.:alymaibra	our daughter has had this product for quite some time and sad to say she hasnt touched it much at all. this product does get alot of attention but it is more so with reassembly. it does not swing, it does not stay together. i am constantly putting the legs back on and setting it back up and placing it with my daughters lil corner of little mommy playthings. of all the items collected, this one seems to be the one with the most problems. we do have a variety of brands varying in price from cheaper to more expensive. this one is by far the worst product we have yet purchased for her collection. we have very few dolls that actually fit in the swing and the ones that do, are too small for it. it is also the smallest item my daughter has for her dolls that range in size. we will not purchase another of these as well as recommend others to not purchase one. if the price is too good to be true, then you will only get what you paid for	0
B00063FDNU:such_a_ripoff!!!!!:	When I bought this toy, I thought it was SOOOO COOL. But it really doesn't do ANYTHING it's supposed to do! It just makes annoying crying and whining noises that DO NOT sound real. Even if I tickle its tummy it just whines and cries. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy this toy!!!!	0
B00068O1Y2:do_not_buy_this_toy!_:allison_d._blom	DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS TOY, THE BATTERY IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR THIS TOY. LEARN FROM MY MISTAKE. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!! no where in the product discription does it tell you that the 9.6 volt battery is NOT INCLUDED, all it says, is that you will have to purchase a 9 volt battery for the remote. Don't look for the Tyco 9.6 volt battery in a store or on line, because it will be "out of stock". I have been trying to purchase one for  4 months	0
B0007PHO9S:frustrating_to_say_the_least:c._garner_"lovesbooks"	Don't buy this price increased version.  I doesn't work any better than the $19.95 model.  Plus it uses twice the amount of batteries.  The concept is great, the graphics are great and that's the end of it.  This just like the first plug and play Ms Pacman (which I also bought) and has a joy stick issue.  If the manufacturer would take off the games that need the twisting action of the joy stick maybe this would actually be fun to play instead of frustrating.  While playing Ms Pacman which is the ONLY reason I bought these plug and plays Ms Pacman has a mind of her own, turns corners on her own and runs into the ghosts on her own.  It's impossible to use the joy stick without twisting it during play and then you're out of control.  It's extremely frustrating.  For as popular as Pacman and Ms Pacman were in their day and still are these plug and plays would sell on that merit alone so take off the games needing the turning action of the joystick	0
B0000649D3:what_a_waste_of_money...:	I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas.  He is 5 so I had to help him put them together.  It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart.  The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks.  If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great.  If your child wants to play with them, forget it.  Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life	0
B000A32OCY:not_one_to_play_with:patrick's_mom_"patrick's_mom"	I helped my five-year old assemble this, and, like most LEGO directions, it went together well...unfortunately, it doesn't stay together...when he tries to play with it, the tail section falls off or it breaks in the middle...not as easy to put back together once it's come apart...it's proven a real disappointment..	0
B0006HB9KW:incredibly_frustrating_toy:h._koehler	This marble maze looks so fun and cute. However, it's actually useless and incredibly frustrating. The pieces don't fit together well and tend to fall over when you look at them--much less when you try to roll a marble through them. Also, the configurations pictured on the box don't work at all. Either our giraffe is missing a critical piece, or the wood planks are supposed to magically levitate. Ugh, I'm returning this immediately	0
B00004TEZZ:how_about_loud_songs--not_soft_songs:renee_theobald	I consider myself a very tolerable and patient parent when it come to toys with noise, however; this phone is way too LOUD for baby/toddler.  It actually startles my 15 month old and makes him cry because it is so loud. Plus, it is powered by the wonderful button batteries that don't last. This was given as a gift, glad I didn't spend my money on it. Be aware that this phone is annoying, really serves no purpose and is too loud for babies ears	0
30014	My kids love this game.  They sit down together and play this game all of the time.  The neighbor kids come over to our house because they love to play board games and SORRY is the one they choose the most.  We do not have video games at our house, and this was considered a drawback to the neighbor kids until my kids introduced them to board games.  Now they come over all of the time just to play board games.  I say hide the video games and let the kids interact with each other playing board games.	1
52304	I received this game as a gift and it really is a great! The book that comes with it would have been a perfect 'Cliff Notes' for the Art History classes I had in school.  My eight-year-old daughter won the first game we played and I'm re-learning lots of stuff I had forgotten. Highly recommended	1
89885	An unexciting piece. Of value only to the completist collector (like myself). There's nothing wrong with it, it's just that there's nothing "great" about it either. The lauching projectiles are unnecessary for a "holographic" figure. Hasbro could has done better by choosing another "host" sculpt to base this exclusive off of. The "Phantom Menace" version was much better	1
245706	We have enthusiastically played Candy Land with each of our three kids.  It is easily the best starting point for introducing a child to board games.  Players take turns drawing from a deck and moving their pieces around the board.  The cards have one or two squares of a particular color (such as red, green, yellow, etc.) and players move pieces ahead on the path to the next matching spot of the same color.  No counting or reading is required.  There are also special cards that can move a player ahead or behind, and they are indicated by  picture of the spot on the board to which the player should move their piece.  Play continues until one player reaches the end.	1
304855	This game has no board therefore no time is wasted trying to move from one room to another to make accusations. The luck in this game depends on which sleuth cards you draw rather than rolls of the dice. Strategy is the same as the original game only game play moves more quickly with one being able to gather information on nearly every turn they have. Sometimes you can actually eliminate more than one item on your list during your turn. All in all, this is a fun game that you can play over and over again in an evening with out getting bored with it	1
350982	My 3 year old is very interested in space and LOVES this toy. Having said that one has to make sure that her child plays carefully with it----the payload doors don't really close, the robotic arm is a bit hard to use and the satellite dish on the truck is difficult to put back on. Meets the need for a realistic shuttle, though	1
419527	Purchased the Batman Laptop Computer at Target for Christmas for my grandson who is not quite 5 years old.  He was totally drawn in because it is Batman....but the games kept his interest. The entire family enjoyed trying the different games. Dad, a musician, enjoyed the music game. Graphics are super... I love the way Batman gives his approval with a thumbs up when you get the answer right....and the cool light inside that allows you to adjust from green to red. Grandma played in the dark with grandson for fun even. Worth the $38.99 I paid at Target on sale for sure.	1
491161	I am so glad I bought this puzzle for my 3 year old! The pieces have the most beautiful pictures on them and the larger sized pieces are just right for toddler hands. This is one of those toys that you'll want to keep forever	1
518961	Every child should have a chance to play this game at least once in their lifetime. The characters on the game board are so awesome too. Queen Frosting (that was her name... right?) is so pretty, she was always my favorite character. All in all, it's a great game and a great gift for nearly any child	1
550702	My 9 year old son just started to understand this game, we bought it when he was 7.  He would get confused on how to call out the other persons ships.  He would say where his ships were.  This game helps kids understand they need to pay attention and coordinate where their ships are.  It depends on how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game.	1
568841	A lot of people look at this figure and say 'he has no wings!'.While this is true,I still recommend this toy,an excellant hair sculpt and goku's famous 'I have no idea what's going on, but be happy anyway!'look.The wings  are actually  really cool,although the halo has a job staying on.0verall this is a great toy and a definate purchase for any dbz fan or toy collector	1
608860	These dogs are adorable and are a cute addition to the dollhouse set. My daughter sends the other pets outside to play with this set. Plays with them as much as the people. Great addition	1
B000EGETFC:love_the_shake_and_go:mx2_mom	My two year old has several of these cars, and the race track. He loves all things Cars, so these were a big hit. All of the Shake and Go Cars talk before they run, which he especially likes. They are VERY easy for a toddler to operate, but his four year old sister enjoys playing with them, too. They don't run for very long per shake, but that doesn't seem to bother him at all	1
B000639LII:great_dolls:kerry_kaiser	My 2 year old daughter loves these dolls and I like them because you can't remove their clothes or shoes! Very cute and durable dolls	1
B0000E3BU3:awesome_toy!!:jake_&_erik's_mommy	My son got these blocks when he was 2 for christmas.  he is now 4 and 1/2 and still playing with them.  It seems no matter what new toy he has gotten, every morning I hear him carrying out his bucket of these megabloks.  I only wish they came is a larger quantity.	1
B0009S5AWQ:great_toy:j._wells	This toy was bought for my son (14 months) because he has an obsession with the phone.  My son instantly LOVED this toy and has been a great subsitute when he is reaching for the phone and I'm on it.	1
B000K5S976:superior_service:diane_oldham	The item arrived in perfect condition and right when I was told it would be here. I am very happy with this product and seller. Would have no problem doing busy with them agai	1
B0007YDBAA:great_product!:mom_in_florida	My son received this as a christmas gift, and thoroughly enjoys it. This is not a regular DVD. It is designed to go with the "Read With Me DVD" system (a separate remote control that works with it on your TV). A previous reviewer was not aware of this, so it should not have received a bad review for consumer error	1
B000BNEO5S:monkeys:designer_girl	My son loves these! They arrived in perfect condition. LOVE that they are machine washable	1
B00000IWIN:best_ever_=_um..._buy!!!!!!!!:ryan	THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER, HAS OVER 100,000 WORDS. YOU CAN SELECT YOUR CATIGORY AND HOW MANY LETTERS. EACH TIME YOU GET THE WORD RIGHT YOU GET POINTS, AND THEY GET HIGHER AND HIGHER, AND IF U GET IT WRONG IT GETS LOWER. ..	1
B00067TAWG:same_bozo_bop_bag_as_her_mom_had_is_a_big_hit_!:p._k._davis_"nana_songbug"	Our three children, who are now in their forties, were young when we purchased a Bozo Bop Bag for them.  They loved it, used it all the time, and it held up beautifully through the years.   Now our daughter has a daughter of her own and we purchased one for her.  Same design, same wonderful quality, same use as forty years ago.  Bozo is a "friend" who likes to be punched so he can bounce back up.  Our 3 year old grand daughter loves him.  She now has a baby sister 7 months old who will also be able to make use of Bozo.  For toddler activity and appropriate "acting out", I thoroughly recommend this product with no reservation.  It's a bit pricey, but worth 5 stars for sure	1
B000JSUBUM:i_have_to_disagree_with_the_bad_review.:cheryl_d	We did not buy the refill but purchased the original set with sandbox. It works wonderfully and my kids have played with it for hours. Clean up is easy. Another family I know just used theirs for the 1st time and they also had a wonderful experience.	1
B0007V634O:good_product_durable:sadie_mcdermott_"rose9158"	I found this hamper storage bin to be great the kids can see into the bins and the bins don't add weight to the unit so the kids can carry the bins easily to pick up toys. However the bins could be a little bigger because they tend to fall off the holding rods if you bump the unit. The hamper is great because my 3 year old son can fill up his hamper but he can't tip it over and spill dirty clothes on the floor but it is light weight and easy for him to help haul to the laundry if he wants to. Good Ite	1
B0001GBR6Y:great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:thunder_scripting	i can't say how great this toy is i mean it's tall and the word he says is sweet pick it up today dont waste any time..... or and dont fall alsleep. it's just great in every way that's all i have to say i mean if you dont pick it up you for sure will be sorry... i hope this helped any one who was thanking about getting i	1
B0006SGZ8C:the_best_one:	I love light sabers,I got 13 years all if you think you are big for one of them let me tell you that you will be a kid onlly once so get one an play,I bought one of the basic light sabers and they are so cool, this saber is the best, you can fight and the saber will not get damage, i like it very much. I got a green and black and my brother a blue and black so we can fight. The light saber full extended is like 3/4 of a meter but it do his job. The electronic light sabers are to fancy and they get broke in a moment. THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.	1
B00029R6HE:great_for_kids_who_love_junie_b:mom_in_ny	My 6 year old absolutly adores Junie B.  Santa brought her the Leapter for Chrismas and Grandma gave her the Junie B game.  She only puts it down to go to sleep.  There are a few games (word searches and finding a Noun/Verb/Adjective and Great for 1st/2nd graders. It is a great learning tool.  The software is set up like the Junie B Jones Journal book.  If you child loves Junie B she will definetly adore the game	1
B000EMRVO2:little_girls_love_it!:fourcallmemommy	My daughters (ages 5 and 2 1/2) were given these dolls for Christmas. They love them and play with them every day, especially the 5-year-old. I think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully, but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers.	1
B0000AE5YL:better_than_candyland:l._kalman	We got this when my kids turned 3, however could have gotten it when they turned 2. We play it every day. It tells you which player's turn it is, it also counts the number of spaces you are suppose to go with you and then it says "you're on the 'yellow' space" as a double check. There are 2 modes and we can play on the "difficult" mode (the difference being with the easier mode you only have to know colors, with the more difficult mode, you have to know the alphabet). The characters are REALLY cute to. Best of all, EVERYONE is a winner - yeah! A concept that is difficult to teach a 2 or 3 year old, but this games does a superb job. The computer chip knows what space you are on so it makes sure that everyone wins within 2 turns (that I've experienced), so those with little patience can "wait it out"	1
B0009PY6I8:battle!:r._howell_"helixkahn"	Muffet vs Spider! This is one cool looking figure and since the accessory spider is as big as Muffet makes it a kick butt scene. Again the turn is to the S&M pink & black leather bondage look, similar to the spiked outfit of Red Riding Hood. This is certainly not the image your mind conjures up to the nursery rhyme but it's a great display piece. The downfall from five stars is that when setup, Muffet is almost obscured by the spider. Both pieces look great in detail but a slightly different pose may have improved the figures	1
B00000JHXV:terrific_terrence!:christa_dillman	My son is a huge fan of the Thomas & Friends diecast trains and building sets.  Despite the fact he had amassed a large portion of these toys, an important character was missing from his collection: Terrence the Tractor.  Of course, he was thrilled when this little vehicle showed up in his Easter basket.	1
B000059XI2:great_backpack:m._dunlap_"mom_of_two"	This backpack has plenty of room for the extra LeapPad books and cartridges we have. I love having them all together with even little compartments for the cartridges to be secure in.	1
B00000IWH6:classic_board_game:polly_a._velder	We love this game.  All members of the family can play it and we've enjoyed it as a family many time	1
B0007YDEFC:read_with_me_dvd:_curious_george_dvd_rom:win	I enjoy seeing my twin four year old son's play with the Read with Me DVD program and CD's. The children are learning as they play. I see them recalling information and reviewing parts of the story. This educational toy is very engaging.	1
B0007PHOYI:perfect_toy_for_toddler!:rosemary_a._bertinelli_"freelance_writer"	One day I realized that my baby is now a toddler and his toys are all...well baby toys!  I browsed the toy aisles for the perfect, age apporpriate replacements hating to spend more money on more plastic, yet desperate for anything that will engage him for at least 15 minutes and keep him STILL so I can put clothes away, vacuum, sometimes just SIT and play. This does it!	1
B0007TZX10:fun_for_the_whole_family:sara_"babe"_hackett	Everyone in my family is enamored with this fantastic Darth Vader mask. We bought it initially for my son, who is Darth Vader obsessed, but it's quickly become the house favorite. (Even Grandpa can't resist putting this mask on and pretending to be Darth for a spell.)	1
B00005JS94:fun,_but_can_take_a_long_time._:donna_"babyonahill"	My 6 yr old loves this game of War. The food chain comes to life in this game of who eats who. Besides the plankton, shrimp, little fish, big fish and Shark, there are also electric eel cards and ink out octopus cards for added excitement. The game is played like war, but the instructions add a slap Jack element. This is not my favorite part. We have limited the slap jack part to just the electric eel card, which still annoys me and makes it difficult for a younger child to play with older children. The ink out card prevents anyone from winning that set of cards and gives the person with less shark cards a chance to win shark cards from the other person. This game can go on and on, don't be afraid to adjust some rules to make this game more enjoyable for your little one and not so complicated.	1
B0006216Q4:non-stop_fun!:bz_cam	I bought this for my son for Christmas after he saw it advertised in a magazine.  He has been playing with it almost non-stop since then.   It is loud and somewhat intricate but easily masterable by small kids. It also connects with other Matchbox sets and comes with a mat for layout.  Based on my boy's interest and use so far, this rates 5 out of 5	1
B000284X6W:daycare_hit!:isabella's_mom	I work at a daycare and have an 11 mo old and can promise this is a great toy!  My baby loves it and she usually gets bored with toys fast.  All of the babies like to open and close the door and crawl through.  It also has a doorbell that rings and a light that turns on.  It plays several different songs and really keeps the attention of older children as well as babies.  I highly recommend	1
B0007V63KS:we_love_baby_pooh!:dmw	My 21 month old daughter received Baby Pooh for Christmas and plays with him EVERY day. She loves diapering pooh when her baby brother gets a diaper change, and bathes with him nightly. He comes with a duckie and bottle of his own. The high chair back does not stay attached to the chair, but Pooh still sits upright and has enjoyed many meals with my daughter. Pooh is made from hard plastic and, sadly, his arm broke off when dropped by my husband this weekend. My daugher is handling the trauma OK, but we are getting her an new Pooh for her birthday because she loves him so much. I recommend it	1
B0002V84U0:wonderful,_sturdy_high_chair_built_for_years_of_play.:kristina_j._ivey_"children's_book_addict"	I bought this high chair for my daughter's second birthday because I love the look of it. The similar chair made by Badger Basket Toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so I went with this one despite it having no reviews. I couldn't be happier. This high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble. I love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter's room may go through decorative changes in the coming years. I don't forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last. She has several dolls, the largest being her 17" Corolle Lila, who fits beautifully in the chair.  I would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a 20" doll. While it is solidly built, I am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself (I've caught her trying to several times) because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy! The only real negative is the joke of a chair pad. I actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add to the toy's play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance. I highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies. It's made me look to KidKraft for more toys and doll furniture	1
B0001GT2KC:wonderful_pool_toy:pool_mom	I purchased this at my 10 year olds request for a birthday present.  I was skeptical, but since it was the only thing requested, I bought it.  We've had it 4 weeks.  What a great pool toy!  Kids love it!  We have a 22 foot above ground pool, and it works fine.  I have bought floats for upwards of $25 dollars, so for the cost of the Wave Cruiser you can't go wrong.  It seems to be well built and sturdy.  I wouldn't hesitate to get on it.  Takes 8 "D" batteries that are in a water tight case.  It will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy, but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids.  Overall great gift idea	1
B000ETXOF0:fun,_but_you_have_to_discard_the_direction_sheet:a._bryant_"readerzealot"	DOND is a fun game, and we've had some lively sessions playing it.  There is an additional (we forget...we got rid of it!)...complicated thing that the game had, and made it "less fun" to play.	1
B00006IFTO:crossword_puzzle_solver:p._c._erdhaus	This was strickly a replacement for an old solver that I have had.	1
B000EK59H0:great_for_toddlers!:j._church	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, three days before her first birthday. She loves taking the pieces out, banging them together and recently, putting them in the correct spaces! The size of the pieces is perfect for a young toddler and the knobs are the right size for her hands. Will definately look at Melissa and Doug puzzles for her again	1
B00000IZQI:fun_cars:j._marcillo	This is a fun toy, just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels. You can ask which one is biggest, what color is this car, ask about the numbers on the cars, etc... that is why I think it is educational to that respect. My son still has this, and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along	1
B00000IWEU:catch_phrase_is_a_must-have:claudia_birkeland	Every family, every party, every gathering of kids and adults or combinations of both will love this game	1
B0007ZCJ1G:excellent_set,_flimsy_hull:david_runyon	This set was one of the most fun builds I've done with Lego in a long time. As an adult fan of Lego, I highly recommend this set for its minifigures and part selection. They are excellent additions to any castle or general builder. As a builder, the final construction is impressive in size (18+ inches long), functionality (the rotisserie chicken is quite amusing), and playability (the sea serpent's posability and the incredible catapult alone are stunning). The catapult was my favorite part. After seeing the necrotic firing action of the Lego Exo-force Mobile Defense Tank's disk launcher; the rapid-fire, long-range Viking catapult is astonishingly fun to play with. The lone drawback in this set is the fragility of the ship's hull. It should be assembled on a hard surface (I tried to build it on carpet) and slid about on the floor, not carried (it will fold in half in the air). A few extra plate elements to reinforce the hull joints would probably improve this set	1
B00020LXKY:super_tough_truck!:shopgirl	My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend	1
B00078ZHC6:pretty_pair:breyergal_"breyergal"	This lovely new set depicts one of America's best-loved and most popular breeds.	1
B0001WCX3E:keep_their_attention!!!:numomee	My son got this toy for his first birthday. He's now 18 months and still loves it! When he first got it, he immediately began to dance to the music. You can press certain body parts on Ernie and then he sings about them (i.e. eyes, mouth, ears).My son can now identify his ears, mouth and eyes on himself. Great toy	1
B000212VH2:good_toy:j._ford_"qtstbbevr"	i love the loop to hang elmo up to dry, and my now 14 month old enjoys drawing with the soap crayons, and chewing on them unfortunately.  not her favorite toy but enjoyed	1
B000JLNZNY:the_snake_is_fun_for_younger_kids:peggy_l._bailey	My almost 5 year old daughter loves this toy.  It is easy for her to control.  My 8 year old thinks it is boring.	1
B000059EI7:_gets_lots_of_use:tiffany_mannes_"tlm_childcare"	I purchased this house for my in home day care. So we have lots of toddlers playing with it! They love it! The only complaint I have is that the door falls off easily if the child pushes it instead of pulls it. But the kids all fit in there and even bring chairs. Even the one year old loves it! He likes to play peek a boo with the shutters. Lots of fun and well worth the money	1
B00000IWGW:brain_on_the_go:rodrigo_vivar_"rodrigo"	I've bought this toy for my daugther ( she's 6 ) and she loves it, it's a good toy to use alone, to share with friends or even with her parents ( myself ). It's a good option to the computer, she also carries this toy with her stuff when she goes outside	1
B00006699W:this_seems_familiar:sconnie	Amazon[.com] recommended this game for me, based on the fact that I love the game Set.  Unfortunately Xactika bears a strong resemblance to "10 to 1," a game played with a normal deck of cards.  If you already know how to play "10 to 1," Xactika may seem derivative.  After trying Xactika once or twice, we threw it in the drawer and just played "10 to 1" instead	1
B00006N5SD:great:rosie	My 2 year old and 4 year old love this playdoh set.  I recommend it highly	1
B0001GBROQ:excellent_nostalgia_piece,_great_to_just_pick_up_and_go_with!!!:concerned_one_"thrashfan"	This is an excellent gaming system containing five acrade classics, Ms. Pac Man, which plays as close to the arcade as you can get, Pole Position, which the Joystick turns as a stearing wheel, again close to acrade action, Mappy, where you are a mouse trying to get a cat on the loose in a museum (much like original mario brothers), Galaga-an updated space invaders type game with more difficult ships to hit, and finally Xevious, where you are commander of a ship blowing up attaching enemies over land and see (plays like Tiger Heli for nintendo, or other games like this).  I use this on my old call room tv with mono av jacks available, works great, passes the time with family friendly games. These games are much better than some of the new expensive games.  check this out, you will be pleasently surprised, and for around 6-12 dollars, good deal. Runs on 4 AA batteries, then plug and play	1
B0002YDQ0K:so_much_fun:k._givens	This Eeyore is so much fun.  I gave it a 4 because the little butterfly is too easy to lose, but if Mom and Dad are diligent to keep the part with the toy and teach Baby to keep them together, I think there is also something to be learned with this, plus the fact that he is so DARN cute and the little voice is sweet and soothing. "GOOD NIGHT BABY."  Just precious.  Baby quickly learns that Eeyore only works with the butterfly rattle.  I thought the ears would be easy to break, but they have taken a lickin' from my grandson and still work.    Nana Ka	1
B000CIQ3WO:feels_real_-_in_the_wallet_too:mark_hunsaker	These coins are nice and heavy... they have a good feeling when you hold them or keep them in the pouch.  My son uses them like Jack Sparrow does in the movie so he doesn't die in our play battles.  However, they seemed rather expensive after buying them and having them shipped.  It would be cheaper to use silver dollars or other real US currency that is large and heavy	1
B0007RXJNQ:awesome_wiggles!!:k._snodgrass	Just as promised.  Our son loves the Wiggles plate, bowl and cup!  Perfect	1
B000JM4S8Y:fun!!:brenda_sorensen	Not only will this be a fun gift for our 5 year old grandson, it will be a fun gift for our 65 year old brother-in-law!  Quite realistic looking!    It works great on smooth surfaces, but doesn't do well on carpet. Our dogs got a big kick out of it	1
B000EX0GW0:this_one's_a_winner!!:numom	I got this for my 15 month son. HE REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. The "oil change" sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find	1
B0007WX1DE:more_than_a_toy_-_it's_a_blast!:w._heeter	This is the ultimate in home laser tag fun.  It has great range and accuracy for hours of exciting but harmless fun.  Get your kids away from the TV games and into the real (figuratively speaking) thing.	1
B00001NTXP:great_game_for_all_ages:learning_all_the_time_"book_lover"	This game is very easy to learn.  Each of the 16 playing pieces has 4 attributes, height (tall & short), color (white and brown), shape (circle & square), and hollow/solid.	1
B000CEXNGW:3_year_old_nephew_couldn't_wait_to_put_it_on:patricia_benjamin	My nephew Cooper put on his superman suit right away.	1
B00000JKL7:my_favorite_game_ever:b._bledsoe_"b."		1
B000E40RUK:fun_and_functionable!!:s._adams_"goo's_mom"	My daughter purchased this with Christmas money and it did not work at all. We reported this to Amazon and they took care of immediately. I was very impressed! Now we have a new toy that she loves that works great. It is fun to play with and a storage container when she's finished.	1
B00064XG9W:great_game_for_adults,_and_probably_kids_too:jacqueline_loosbrock_"travel_queen"	My husband and I travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises.. We actually watched 2 people playing it as well. So my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a Christmas gift. Surprised me!!	1
B00004TQMQ:excellent_first_thinking/strategy_game_for_kids:h._lewis	Bought this one recently for my eight year old (and myself) to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it.  More challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games.  I highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing, thinking spatially, understanding the consequences of a move or moves, and introducing the concept of strategy	1
B000AQA9SC:for_all_horse_collectors:melinda_escarcega_"extreme_critic"	Breyer makes such authentic lifelike replicas of the worlds most beautiful horses.  My daughter is in horse heaven.  The detail is so accurate that my daughter noticed even the footpad of the horses were unique to each one	1
B00000IZYR:too_late_for_my_1_year_old!:	I think I missed the boat on this one; I bought it for xmas for my 13 month old and the only real play it gets is when my daughter and her 3 year old brother take off the "play top" and sit inside it!  They think thats fun but thats about it	1
B000BB567K:i_like........:elmo_fan/mom_"hovas_wife"	this elmo item is pretty cool. if ur child is an elmo fan then im sure you know how annoying these elmo doll/ toys can be.. oh jeez the voice is so loud and it echoes.!!! however this one is far less annoying than the rest because he hums when you plug his mouth -- im srry i meant ta say when you give him his pacifier (lol)-- you just hear an adorable hum sound. Overall this is a cool gift. Theres is an off button I only wish there was a lower volume button for early morning play	1
B00065H570:great_car_keys:b._hanson	I purchased the Parents Magazine version first and my one year old son didn't play with it much but after watching him go crazy at a friends house with this Hasbro toy I purchased it and he has been playing with it ever since.  The buttons are placed in such a way that he can hold it with both hands and press buttons at the same time.  He also enjoys teething on the keys.  I highly recommend this product for mothers who want to hold on to their own keys	1
B000EMRVP6:good_addition_for_the_doll:b._vanfield_"writer"	I like the set up. It looks like a daycare really appears. It is great to spur on your childs creativity and role playing skills.	1
B000065CK2:yeay_leappad:c._a._dudyk_"wonder_mom"	Anything Leappad is great . Its one of the best things to come from the computer toy area for kids yet. My son is ahead of his class in reading with the help of Leappad. At 6 he reads at a midrange grade 1 student and is progressing quickly. I highly recommend This and any other Leap pad book and toy . Most schools have dropped Phonics from the classrooms and Leappad has brought it back in a fun form your little one will love..	1
B0009ANJMM:great_for_both_of_my_girls:a._mcgraw_"busy_mom_of_3"	My daughter got this for her 6th birthday.  She absolutely loves it, as does her 3 year old sister.  One of them is using it all the time.  The 3 different tops on the wand are a little frustrating for my 3 year old, as she can't switch them out herself and comes running to have someone else switch the tops for her.  My 6 year old has caught onto all of the dance moves and is able to do them along with the DVD.  My 3 year old can't do them all, but she has a great time just doing what she can.  Both of my girls love Cinderella, so they put on their dress up Cinderella dresses whenever they do the DVD.  I wish there was a way to order just an extra mat, though, so they could do the DVD together instead of fighting over who gets to stand on the mat	1
B000AX22ZI:a_lovely_doll_with_better_than_usual_hair:j._cunningham_"rev._doctor"	I agree that the Denver reviwer is totally out to lunch. This doll greatly resembles my daughter's friend Jenny Liu. Jeeny  was born in Taiwan. Chinese people don't look any one way and to expect them to is racist, like saying they all look alike.	1
B000IZZDAE:hyperscan_game_system:evelyn	My 8 yr old grandson wanted this for Christmas but the price was over $100 so when I saw it for under $15 on Amazon, I got it for his birhtday in February.  He and his 9 yr old brother LOVE it!  I also purchased one booster pack at the same time.  Then I found another game and booster pack at Target for a very reasonable price. So he got the game system, two games and two booster pack of cards all for under $50.00!  Both he and I were happy!  (The only reason I give this a "4" is because the games are a bit hard to come by	1
B000H407QQ:love_this_toy!:dr._mom	I don't care if it stops working tomorrow... my daughter has gotten so much enjoyment out of this in just one day that it was totally worth the money.   (you can get them cheaper at Target though)  She was always stealing the portable phones around the house or walking off with my cell phone... and now she has "her" phone she is just delighted.... she loves when it rings and she opens it up and pretends to talk.... so far this phone works great, but like I said... it is such a cool toy I'd go out and buy a new one right away.	1
B000EPFESO:finally_a_toy_that_works!:m._bosak	After assembling a Dora's Talking Cash Register that scans the wrong items, a Dora's talking backpack that is just plain dumb- this is the toy that scored this Christmas!  This toy is easy for my 3 year old to maneuver the pony in and out of the walker and actually works like you would expect.  Plus the pony is fun to play with out of the walker.  My daughter doesn't even question why it only talks in the walker. So what if it doesn't!  It will be fun to sleep with because it is soft and has pajamas on.  I would recommend this toy- very cute and fun!	1
B0001ZVBZC:great_building_toy!:d-m-a	My son cannot wait to get a bigger set.  Compared to other magnetic building sets Geomags is, by far, better quality although it is also more expensive	1
B00002MZ6X:soccer_madness:	I think that the soccer ball is great but not that educational only because all you do is paint	1
B000GI02F4:cute,_little_girl_loves_it!:h.l._"shopper"	Very cute and soft. Little girl loves it and goes on line to the web site to play with her virtual pet.  Lots of fun	1
B000FEBVEK:loving_family:gregory_hendry_or_hendry	I love this  doll house and all its furniture. It was very average no fake looking dolls and I loved the office furniture for the doll house. We have had a lot of fun playing with it including me. It is good for my daughter and I to spend time playing together.	1
B000A0VY50:well-constructed,_easy-to-assemble,_colorful,_and_very_enjoyable:ben_p._stein	I bought this set for my 3.5 year old.  We have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks. Once put together, my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers.  I am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent, well-illustrated and clear, and I had no problem with them.  (My only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set, and took a moment to identify.)  At first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls, but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle.  By imitating me, he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well.  He also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself, with their arms, legs, helmets, swords and shields.  Through doing the set I also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors, and the third time we made the castle, he was repeating this point to me!  The drawbridge is really fun and well-done.  It raises and lowers very smoothly.  This particular set is really only designed to make the castle, so it's not really meant for making many different things like the other Superstruct sets.  But this was our first one and I have no regrets.  Assembly time was about 30 minutes the first time, but after you do it once it seems closer to 15 minutes.  The pieces are high-quality, fit very well, and are generally a joy to handle and see.  The castle looks great once assembled, and will impress any adults or kids who see it	1
B000297POI:love_her,_love_her._=):g._miller_"elastigirl"	Both my 3-year old daughter and my 5-year old son (to his father's chagrin) love playing with and endlessly dressing Dora. Her outfits are darling and my children enjoy mixing and matching (or not-so-matching in some cases) the clothes, too. We are looking forward to adding new outfits as well as the armoire and bed - Dora needs a place to sleep!	1
B0002CEXRW:outbust_remix:laurie_keller	A lot of fun! The kids really enjoy this updated version of their favorite game. Product was shipped promptly!	1
B00021Z2FU:my_kindergartner_loves_it:dnapo	I got this for my 5 year old, who started kindergarten this fall, and she is in love with the whole school concept.  She loves to pretend to be the teacher with this playset.  Her friend came over one day and played with it, too, and they took turns being the student and teacher.   I ended up buying another set for her friend's birthday.	1
B000A12Y2G:great_product,_great_fun:greg_stefkovic	This is a well engineered product; I cannot call it a toy because it is much much more than that. After building just one of the sample setups I was able to put down the manual and start creatively designing and building my own. My daughter (3.5 years old) loves it. She really likes placing a marble on the run when I tell her its time to "test it", and I let her identify the error. The only marbles that have fallen off the track are due to construction errors by myself. After 1 day (and several of our own setups) we already find ourselves wanting more pieces. I suggest buying the largest set from the get go if you have an engineering type mind or just enjoy puzzles. Nice feature to note : the coloring of the blocks is logical; each color has its own unique function(s).	1
B000BC99I6:fusion:david_t._pugh_"idea_jockey"	I am quite fond of this character.  Sure, he is a horribly evil dictator who wouldn't give a second thought to breaking you in half if you looked at him wrong, but you have to understand where he's coming from.  As the Hulk, Bruce Banner focused his rage against evil to help humanity.  Then there is a world-wide nuclear holocaust, the world is a wasteland, and, as the Hulk, Bruce sucks up a lot of the radiation.  Fusing his mind to the Hulk's, I think he has a right to be a little screwed up and angry.  This highly possible figure comes with a spiky crown thing and the appropriate comic book.  He may not make a great center piece, but the figure is good looking, none-the-less	1
B00005NIUR:fun_for_little_ones:s._franz	Great slide!!  No assembly required, just unfold and your ready for fun..perfect size for young toddlers.  Bright colors and cute, happy carrot face.  Great fun for indoors or out	1
B0006NHDHO:loved_them:s._triebwasser_"sheri"	I recently bought these 4 little Dora dolls for my 4 yr old's birthday.  She really loves them.  She plays with them all the time.  It is a nice collection to her Dora stash!	1
B00000IRW0:school_bus_as_a_gift:mom_of_4_"janet"	Bought for 2 year old twins... it held up with about 5 kids in it and even an adult at the birthday party.  The only thing that doesn't appear to be the greatest is the detachable steering wheel because with my kids it would end up missing in no time.   Definitely a great gift.	1
B000E8O7R0:like_any_other_polly_product:laurell_l._kuehn	I think that this was a great item - something unique from what I can usually find around here.  My daughter loved it.  Like any other Polly items, lots of little pieces but overall very nice.  I was a bit miffed when I found out that the photo booth really doesn't take photos.  I guess I should have thought about that a bit more.  Overall, it's just fine	1
B00000GBQJ:confidence-booster_for_kids,_fun_for_all_ages:karen_b._brauer_"musing-by-the-liffey"	You know the family games that you regret buying, especially when you see your child coming at you with it on a rainy day, saying, "Will you play this with me?" Well, Rat-a-Tat-Cat is not one of these.	1
B0001CJANU:lots_of_fun_and_so_cute!!:nj_mommy	My 9 month old received this for Christmas and loves it!  He is not quite crawling yet, he sort of scoots around and loves to grab and wrestle this toy.  So far it has been very sturdy but yet soft enough for the baby to roll on and squeeze.  The voice and phrases it says are so very cute too, we love the little giggle and when it says "Hello Baby"!! This is an adorable toy	1
B00006HBTL:helps_coordination:iesha_jamison_"imani's_mom"	We (my husband and I) brought this toy for our 2 year old last Christmas because then she was an Elmo fanatic. She still plays with this toy even though her intrests have shifted to Dora! At first I wasn't quite sure what this thing did except make noise but as I watched her play with it, I realized it taught her to follow directios.	1
B000063KCJ:scrabble_foilo:vickie_l._wilson_"vickie"	This is the best game for the beach and the car. The little letters clip right into the board. It has a zipper case also. It's great and we enjoy it very much	1
B0002HOFM0:could_use_more:j._battle_"jbattle"	These dominos are great for the hello kitty lover.  My six year old loves them.  Don't be fooled by the picture though, the tin is not full.  If you ask me, there are not enough of them in there.  The tin is filled about three quarters with plastic to hold the dominoes up in the window and make it look full.  I would have rated it five stars if it had been full	1
B0000936KP:great_set_for_in_between_stages_kids!:k._charles_"mom_to_3"	I have read other reviews here that this table is too high for 2 and 3 year olds. Maybe so but, it is wonderful for 4-5 year olds! Those "in between stages" kids who want to have a small table of their own but, need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers. My son (almost 5) and his big sister (7) can both sit together and eat a snack at this table. It is very sturdy! The small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time. The surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures. The unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space. My son had outgrown 2 "child size" table and chair sets by age 4- most are actually buit for toddlers- this table is actually for "Kids" and it has been a big hit at our home. Guess who's getting the matching Lifestyle kitchen for Christmas	1
B0007YDB8C:great_story_for_the_read_with_me_dvd_player:kid_at_heart_"kid_at_heart"	This was a great addition to our Read with Me dvd collection.  My son loves it - there are so many games and options available that it keeps him occupied for hours!	1
B000CIU70I:saw_this_on_jay_leno_show_for_funantics_toys:	Saw this on Jay Leno and it was a Hilarious Gift!  Tried it out and it dances to the chicken dance song and when you grab its neck it yelpsand pretends to choke then when you let go it continues its dance.  I Can't wait to give it as a Christmas Present.	1
B000GKAU1I:my_3yr_old_love_this_puzzle:iresh_ekanayake	My 3 year old received this puzzle as a gift for his 3rd yr birthday. I wasn't so sure if he was ready for the puzzle at the age of 3, but four months after his birthday together with his cousins he started putting the pieces together. He is now 3.5 yrs. and knows how to complete it all by himself within less than 10min. I give ten stars	1
B000AEOFFM:great_toy_for_the_price:carrie_garcia	I bought this toy because Amamzon's price was a great bargin compared to other stores.  I would have given this product 5 stars but gave it only 4 because the can is so large and the lincoln logs only fill is maybe half way.  There is a lot more room for more logs.  115 sounds like a lot but you are only able to make the one cabin seen on the front.  I ended up buying additional logs (not lincoln logs) so that me and the kids could build additional buildings and a fence	1
B00000IRYI:great_attention_grabber!:numom	my 19 month old loves the toy for its colors, I like it because it allows me to get more chores finished in the kitchen! It has a nice suction base to keep the top steady on tile. It was a little difficult at first, for my son to handle, since a good bit of strength is needed to push the bar down especially if you want to hear it hum and spin fast. The colors are pretty cool, The faster it spins the more colors come out (primary + yellow/orange colors). I like that it holds his interest. A [...] could defentley get this down better but at least there is room to grow!	1
B000063XNP:great_set_of_crayons!__highly_recommended!:jennifer_j._young	This set of crayons is very durable & colorful!  It comes in a cute organized pouch which has 4 zippered compartments that fold togehter and velcro shut.  The crayons are EXCELLENT quality, comparable to Crayola.  Young kids and adults will enjoy hours of fun with crayons.  Create things to your hearts desire.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PRODUCT and Great for Travel Too!	1
B000HFQRV4:she_will_make_a_big_splash!!!:kellie_hein_"bcb's_rockstar_mom"	We wanted this little doll for our own "Little Ariel". She is perfect for the bath tub! She comes with her own float, wand with bath tints, and swim coverup!! Her bright red hair is put in little pig tails with bows and she has a baby powder fresh scent (which we were not expecting- my husband is not to found of that). We are very pleased and hope that this company continues to make baby princess items!!!	1
B0006GK38M:no_surprises:arge	This item showed up on time and without incident... I'm not sure what else I can expect from a pair of novelty glasses.	1
B00085EWOW:disgusted:nota_fan_"favorite_aunt"	This review is not about the toy, but about the service you can expect to receive from Amazon.com.  If you are buying this as a gift, only do so if you have months to wait, even if the item is listed as available.  Amazon.com will allow you to pay your money under the guise of sending your items, and then days later, inform you of a delay in shipping, and then a week later inform you the item has just shipped and can take up to an additional 10 days for delivery.  Despite the site's claims that the item would ship in 24hrs and be delivered in 3-5 days.  Mind you, they're sending it via UPS or American Home....	1
B0006FHB8I:practice,_patience,_and_common_sense_make_the_difference:melissa_flamm_"bookaholic_extraordinaire"	I bought my seven and ten year old daughters moon shoes for christmas.  I had read all the reviews, so I immediately instructed the girls to always wear their bicycle helmets when playing with their moon shoes.	1
B000069Z41:must_have:jen_"jen"	We bought the LeapPad Plus for our 4 year old for Christmas and 4 books to go along with it.  Then I realized we had no where to put it, we also bought the Littletouch leadpad for our 1 year old and a bunch of books.  Yesterday we went and bought this and the carry case for our little one's littletouch.  Great space saver.  It is made very well too.  Our daughter calls it her briefcase.  It fits everything perfectly	1
B000BXKT34:great_idea_but_...:c._braicovich_"cb_"	I thought this would be a great gift for my child since she is an avid soccer player and very creative.  The markers provided were not any different than ones that we use for crafts.  I hope that her design will stay on the ball after playing with it	1
B000E36VBK:amazon_to_the_rescue!:lynd_klepesky_"hannah's_mom"	The little mermaid pop-up castle was sold out everywhere this past holiday season selling at $34.99.  I found it on Amazon for $26.47 and free shipping!	1
B000FCE4VO:garfield_&_pookie!!!:dale_manning_"gleanntan"	This item is sooooo cute! Garfield is dressed in his jammies and is clutching Pookie in his left arm. We highly recommend TY Goodnight Garfield, especially if you are a Garfield fan	1
B000MX1EOG:my_daughter_loves_these_little_fairies:retro_mom	My daughter thinks these are the most adorable Fairies.  They adorn every possible accessory she and her friends can attach them to.  You never know who will have which charms as they are always swapping them.  I would say that you get an amazing bang for your buck with these.  They are the "in" thing right now with her 4th grade friends	1
B000068NLU:wow--a_toy_the_kid_will_play_with:leanne_stowe	Legos, Duplos, Ello.. they don't hold a candle to the Kid Knex in the series. Unbelieveable how much our 6 year old daughter plays with these and our 3 YO son too. These have a good feel for kids too. Bright. Easy to use. We have all in set now. BRING ON SOME MORE	1
B0001XNTJA:the_best_high_chair_out_there!:t._gleason	I've had this high chair for a year now, and I love it.  My daughter plays with it every day, and it's worn great.  It still looks as good as the day we put it together.  I love that it's wood, rather than cheap plastic, and it's a pretty white with pink gingham, which I think is adorable.  The material has held up great and still looks perfect.  The wood is sturdy, with no cracks.  It fits all my daughter's dolls, including her large Cabbage Patch doll.  If I were going to change anything, I'd like a little bar in the front of the seat that would prevent the babies from slipping through (like real high chairs).  For the most part, her babies stay put, but sometimes they slip down and out.  It's not a big problem, though.  Our friends bought the same one a year ago for their daughter, and feel the same way about it.  We love the Badger Basket product line!  I highly recommend this product	1
B000H70APQ:love_it!:pat_byram	Fun for kids age 4 -40.  Bought it as a gag for my college age son... he loved it for pranks, but also let young nieces and nephews play with it.  Kept them laughing for a long time.	1
B00004SCW3:well_pleased:terri	I bought the Little Tikes Adjust and Jam Basketball Set for my grandson's 4th birthday. It is perfect for his age group. The height can be raised or lowered and comes with 2 small size basketballs. He loves it	1
B00000IRZ6:present_for_my_2_yr_old_daughter:christina_a._dollar	I bought this for a present for my 2 yr old daughter and she likes it and can turn the handle	1
B000066544:great_game!:e._collins	My family of seven kids, four daughters/sons-in-law have owned this game for 2 years.  We love playing it and it is one of the few games that everyone enjoys.  It is one of our favorite games and that is saying a lot since we own dozens of games.  Our youngest was 12 when we bought the game and she often wins	1
B00005RF5E:cute_and_educational:lydia's_mommy	My daughter is one and a half, and she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures.  Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered.  I'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are, and how well they are holding up.  I feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and lower case.  My only problem is with the tray.  It only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level).  I also don't like its sharp edges.  My daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around.  Now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin	1
B00067AE0S:wow:v._l._wooten_"cyber_shopper"	This is like a real fish the the tub. Our little one loves it	1

B00009AVL1:great_puzzles:m._tomson_"children's_book_lover"	We bought this puzzle for my then 2 year old as he had mastered the barn puzzle (which is also amazing).  There are monkeys, tigers, butterflies, and numerous other jungle animals.  I had to look up several of the animals as I was not sure of what they were.  This was a good educational experience for both me and my son.  This puzzle is durable as are all of the M&D floor puzzles.  It has been stepped on and thrown across the room by a highly rambunctions child.  I have had this puzzle for over a year, and it looks great.  I rotate this puzzle with the other Melissa and Doug floor puzzzles that we have.  I recommend any of their floor puzzles as they are great quality and have easy to handle pieces for kids.  They are a great opportunity to teach about different subjects and teach new words to children	1
B000067R86:happy_shopper:princess_"happy_shopper"	My niece was learning about the birth of Christ at school when I got her this Nativity Set.  She was so happy and it was so easy for me to continue teaching her about the birth of Christ and Christmas.  Thanks - I was very satisfied with this item and so was my niece	1
B000E3LFV6:sweet!:	Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1

B0000669A5:flexible_enough_to_let_kids_play_their_own_way:s._daly	Our 3 children have had hours of fun with this toy during the 2+ years we've had it in our home.  True, the food is long gone (cardboard boxes - toddlers - no surprise there).  We've also needed lash the front piece on with some string (again, it's not constructed to be a bumper car but toddlers don't often keep their play inside the box).  The simple design means that when they twist it beyond reason, it's flexible enough for me to pop it back into alignment.  It's small enough to be comfortable for the 2 year old to push(for hours), and close enough to the real thing to remain interesting for a 5-6 year old.  It's gender neutral, forgiving enough to go down a flight of stairs (repeatedly) without breaking, light enough to not squish whatever's at the bottom.... and sometimes they do even use it to play grocery	1

B00005NN6U:mx_trooper_capsela_#400:renee_carpenter	I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 11 year old grandson. I knew it would be a hit as my son had received it as a gift from his grandparents as a child and was entertained for hours with it. It did not lose it's charm for 11 year old boys through the years. My grandson was thrilled with it as well. Just enough challenge to keep their interest	1
B000068P9P:fun_game:d._scott	I played this game at a Super Bowl party and decided to order one for myself.  My 8 year-old loved playing it and we recently took it to a family reunion and everyone there liked it too	1
B000056J23:it_works_for_doubles_too!:jill_hraban	I have an infant in-home daycare and needed a quad stoller for my four babies.  When I first found these connectors, no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together.  I asked every store in town almost (some didn't even know what they were!). I just decided to buy them and hoped that they would work.  So I went out and bought two Kolcraft Lil' Limo strollers, not knowing, of course, if it would work or not.  I'm happy to say that they seem to work really well!  I did have to buy a second set, though, so I have five connectors on mine(couldn't find room for the sixth one).  Just lock the two inner front wheels so they can't turn and you're off!  It is a little hard to turn corners(just take them at a wide angle), but otherwise it works great!  I ended up spending just under [price] for the total cost of it, much less buying an actual quad stroller.  I hope this info will be helpful to someone else also. Good luck	1
B0001CU1C4:dark-x_reveiws_(atmosfear):	This is a well thought of game.  A game where the players play along with the DVD as the Gatemaster gives you commands, rewards, or punishiments while they are playing the game.  Players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the DVD.  Six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces, as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before 49 minutes is up.  If neither player wins in 49 minutes, the Gate master has defeated you.  In the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun.  The board has six territories.  Each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys.  You can pick up a key by landing on the key space, having a card telling you to, gate master telling you to, or winning a duel.  A duel is when you land on a battle space and 2 players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both.  There are two types of cards... TIME and FATE.  Land on a skull head and get a FATE card which allows you to do something in a certain situation.  A TIME card you get if you land on a clock.  A time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to. Sometimes the Gate master will give you the power to banish someone.  When there is reward, there is also punisment.  If you land on the cursed key, you have to pick it up and whenever you have it, you cannot win.  If you are landed into a black hole, you cannot participate until you are freed.  Also, you can lose keys.  During the game the Gate master says "Stop!" frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished.  All in all, it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money.	1
B00005BYWN:little_one_loves_it:kath	I bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it! The music quality is great and she really enjoys the lights. It has a very sweet face and she smiles and talks to it a lot. I got it on clearance which is good because as cute as it is, I don't think it is worth the original price. I would definately recommend it if you can get it on sale	1
B00009KWTA:very_plaesed:kim	My 2 year old daughter recently recieved this as a present from her grandparents. She loves the disney princesses and was ver excited. I was happy to see how easy it was to put up and take down, she plays with it in her room almost everyday and I love the fact that we can take it down before she goes to sleep. Overall we are very pleased with this tent, although it would be nice if it was a bit bigger so that I could play in there with her	1
B000GKU5KE:domino_people:s._cramer	My son is 4 1/2 and he loved the set.  He and his dad set it up on Christmas and enjoyed ringing the bell.  I would recommend this for kids any age	1
B000ERVM9W:kid_loved_it:s._smith_"michigan_mom"	My 6 year old loves this toy.  She made all 3 bears at one time.  My husband helped her.  They are well made and close up in the back with a zipper and special tool, so they do not come undone unless you want to open them and re-stuff them	1
B0007WX0IA:excellent:tia	My daughter has trouble concentrating in school. I got this for her birthday and her grades instantly improved to the point where her teacher stated that there was a noticable improvement in all areas of her work. The best thing about it is that I don't have to tell her to use it because she loves it. I told her it's just like having a laptop because she always wanted a computer of her own. This is as close as I'm willing to get concenrning her having her own computer at her age, plus it's a minute fraction of the price of a personal laptop.	1
B000A0EFSI:tons_of_fun:c._johnson_"momoftwo"	This product is fun for the whole family. I hope my kids have as much fun as I did with them when I was young	1
B000GKI87G:great_set_of_puzzles:mom_of_2	I think this a great item for a child over 3 1/2.  Since there are 4 puzzles in one box, our son, who just turned 3 has a hard time keeping the pieces separate.  They are symbol coded on the back, so I think once he gets older it will get easier.  He loves the pictures and I love that the pieces are sturdy and how much he is learning.	1
B000IBIGTI:very_cute_for_the_blues_clues_lover:e._singh_"braydons_mommy"	This little toy is cute. My 11 month old son LOVES BLues Clues and loves this toy. He will hold him on his lap while he watches his favorite show! Its really cute	1
B000BCEJ86:a_must_have!:i._klein	My one year old has had this toy for about 4 months now and it's still his favorite toy. There is no end to the amount of fun my child has with this toy and he keeps coming up with new ways to play with it. It's hours of endless entertainment!	1
B0008FUCDM:very_cooooooooooool!:	This toy is the coolest toy I've ever used! When I have slumber parties I always play music, and my friends always say that I have the coolest boombox. Some of them are even thinking about buying one. I love listening to music on my brand new bratz lips boombox. And this year at my birthday slumber party, I'm gonna play music all night. This toy is just so cool!!!!!!!!	1
B000EG6F2C:good_size_-_great_quality:karsten_weiss	We purchased the item hoping that it would be of reasonable size, meaning the food would be closer to "real" size rather than miniature. It was. We also hoped it would be made well and stand up to hopefully more than one generation of use. That remains to be seen, but the stuff is made well and I cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze the plastic pieces and hit them with a hammer. Nice texture, nice flexibility, pretty realistic looks. The child it was intended for (age 4 and a bit) plays happily with it, even the older boys (10 and 13) have had a few moments of goofy fun with it	1
B000GKXY7U:great_number_board:mommyguru_"mommyguru"	Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him.  He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him.  It's well built.  Arrived in only a couple days.  Our son loves it!	1
B000ETRE06:ben_10_omnitrix_f/x:ms._scarlett_naomi	I was very pleased with the order and the speed at which it was delivered. More important, my grandson loves it. It was what he wanted and could not find it here so was very glad for AMAZON	1
B000B6MLNM:scene_it_-_friends_edition:d._s._baker	Love it!  The questions are great...the "party mode" is great entertainment	1
B00067U1S8:cutest_dog:a.a_"a._a."	I am in my twenties...I had one of these dogs when i was little and i loved it. It shows kids the way dogs naturally  feed their puppies. Of course it is only a stuffed animal so it is not going to do anything. But in my opinion it is a very cute toy for a dog love	1
B000C29JSU:fun_and_interesting_concept:michele_thompson	This concept is very interesting and new fangled (at least to me) as far as plush animals.  The interactive/internet/game aspect is very clever and provides a lot of fun for kiddos.  I got this for my nephew and he likes it.  It keeps him entertained.  One thing--they just don't make stuffed animals the way they used to as far as quality.  Justin is not rough with his toys, and this hippo has already lost some of his hair.  I wish we could find good quality plush anymore.  I hate the idea of disposable toys because I grew up with tonka toys and teddybears that I still have.  I still have my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls from about twenty-five years ago, and they have never lost hair.  So buy the hippo for fun, but don't expect him to survive	1
B000021Y68:a_wonderful,_deep_two-player_game:christine_biancheria	This is a great game for two players (and two players only).  The first one or two times I played, it was very, very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in.  However, once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you, games tend to take about an hour.  It's a fairly involved game, so you have to be in the mood for that.  There's a lot of strategy and many ways to win.  I greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games.  It might be daunting for a really casual gamer, though.  If you like it, there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original	1
B00005YWNI:clasic_baseball:nicky	This is a veary FUN baseball game, I first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun, I got it for Myself!!!!!	1
B000BW1N6C:great_gift:jane_wierenga	We had looked a lot of places for jack in the boxes and were pleased to find this unusual one. My girls love horses so it was a pretty easy decision to make. The music is great and it is easy to operate for both of them ( ages 20 months and 3 1/2 )	1
B000FDJ02Q:unusual_toy_for_a_range_of_ages:m._reed	We bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She was immediately interested and so was her three-year-old brother. In addition, her five cousins (ages 5-16) and their father (36)were also captivated. There are eleven gears in five colors that spin when the button is pushed. Initially, she loved to take the gears off and teeth on them. She is fourteen months now and puts them back on. She presses the button to watch them spin. She has taken it to the sitter's and the kids there have played with it all day. When we take it to the sitter's, I put it in a bag because the gears do not stay on when the toy is vertical. So far,it appears to be a toy that will grow with her as she and her brother play with it differently. We rotate toys, but I leave this one out continuously and I often find her playing with it quietly by herself. I have given it five stars because it offers a variety of ways to play (the gears can even be stacked), is different from all other toys they have, appeals to a wide range of ages, grows with the child, does not use up batteries (we are still on the first set), and seems very durable. I recommend this toy	1
B000EPFF3I:i_love_bratz!!:	Hello,	1
B000KKIRT6:she's_gorgeous!:jean_heather_akins	Maybe it's my computer or browser, but the picture here doesn't do this doll justice.  I bought one at my local drug store before I saw it here at Amazon.  I can tell you that this Beach Glam Barbie is gorgeous!  The picture here looks faded to me, but I have the doll right here in front of me, and the pink accessories are a lovely perfect shade of vivid pink, not pale or washed out as it appears to be in this photo.	1
B0009PTXVI:good_buy:	This Schleich Haflinger is a good buy. Schleich is as detailed as Breyer, and are as big as Breyer Paddock Pals. This Haflinger stallion is a palomino, with a shaggy mane and tail. This horse is full of personality, and is well worth the money. Your kid will love this model horse.	1
B000031XD7:little_ladybug_sandbox:l._harvey	I noticed that this ladybug sand box only had 3&amp;1/2 stars and the others all had 5. I felt a need to speak up.  We bought this sandbox for our first son when he was three.  We lived in an apartment with a small back patio.  It was perfect, not too big but still room for a toddler or two to sit in it and play.  He played for hours!!  Now 5 years later, his little brother loves it and my first son, almost 9, still plays with the little one in it.  It still looks brand new, nestled under the tree in our big back yard.  It's really great just smaller than the others. We have since given this for every two year old birthday present we've bought! I highly recommend it	1
B00004WHNS:great_teaching_tool:d._dixon	This is a GREAT way to get your child(ren) to do the things that need to be done around the house.  I purchased two, one for each of my older children and they love that they have control over keeping up with the board. It is easy for them to use and easy for you to keep track of their progress.	1
B0009WLRNS:my_son_is_two_(will_be_3_in_feb)_and_he_was_able_to_use_this_toy_right_out_of_the_box.:k._smith	My son received this toy as a present from his father on Christmas (Dec '05) and he was able to play with it straight out of the box.  I bought my son the V Smile system and he can't use that as easily as he uses the read with me system.  While a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old, it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right.  While with the V smile system he prefers I play and he watch. So I am happy with this purchase and will buy more DVDs for the system.  I have  only one complaint and that is  I wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters.  My son loves Thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could I think he would also like to see Thomas the Tank Engine, Dora the Explorer, and maybe even some books in foreign languages.  But all in all a great system for the younger preschool children.	1
B000HLZJUS:the_best:c._minors_"mom_of_a_fan"	There are so many great things about this that I don't know where to start.  Availability--price--shipping--the list goes on and on.  Bottom line is that my daughter is a big Care Bear fan and it's impossible to find this bear anywhere else.  It arrived quickly, was just as described (in fact it was softer) and occupies a place of honor on my daughter's bed.  I give it a 5, only because that's the highest.  Makes a wonderful gift!!	1
B000ELIXG8:collectible:anonymous_"country_music_fan"	This doll looks like it will be a collectible in a few years. The Lucy in Paris Barbie is already worth more than double what it was selling for a few years ago. This doll will probably go up in value as well. In regards to the person who returned this doll twice for a slightly dented box...GET A LIFE! Who in the hell would return a doll just because the box had a dent! If the doll wasn't damaged why are you returning it????	1
B000BKHYO4:fun_little_house:mommy_of_two	We recently purchased this playhouse, and discovered that it does not come with the peek-a-boo shutters (I don't see the shutters in the photo either although they are mentioned in the product description).  Our 3year old and 18 month old both enjoy it, but I would say it is more fun for the 18 month old than my 3 year old since there is little to actually "do" inside the house.  The doorbell makes fun sounds.  It is very easy to put together	1
B00005NSHT:my_daughter_loves_this_thing:joseph_grier	Her favorite toy... she loves the microphone... keys light up to prompt her to press the keys and play a song.... this thing is great	1
B0009KBUA0:perfect_for_animation:ugogirlz	This is perfect for any stop-motion animator. With over 30 posable joints, Thoron is inexpensive compared to other figures.Also, Thoron's nemosis,Stendhal, is a great figure for animation	1
B0007XTNL2:what_is_her_secret?:lgp3lnc_"lgp3lnc"	This Barbie is better than some of the other new ones but I did`nt see the street style one yet.But I don`t know if they are that good by the reviews i am hearing so far.I like her outfit,typical,shop-o-holic and typical school girls is quite nice and fits her personality.She has a locker with basic stuff you take to school with a secret inside.Her out fit is denim capri`s,black jacket,matching beret,and a tube top with a necklace	1
B000HS1N9W:very_fun_:katherine_a._loupe	these make meals a lot more fun for children...i know my son loves them	1
B00008O0ZE:great_toy:s._kniseley	I went online to look for other Little Tikes toys with the handle and saw that this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only had two stars and I wondered why. I disagree with most of the other reviews. The handle on top makes it easy for him to push around and carry - he can run it up slopes, on the ground, anywhere. He has never fallen or injured himself on it. In fact his frustration occurs because he can only pull the dump truck end up about 50% of the time. Usually he just hands it to me, and points that he wants it open. I do agree that the handle does make it difficult to put large items in the back and that the opening at the end of the dump truck makes it difficult for items to fall out. This is the only reason I'm not giving this toy five stars. But my son loves this truck and has pretty much been playing with it constantly since we got it about a month ago. I'm planning to get him the train with the handle because he likes this toy so much.	1
B000058TJ3:great_pool!:barbara_w.	I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and size of the pool.  The price is quite reasonable, and I was not expecting such a great deal	1
B000EULZFU:fp3_great_idea:elyssa_wynn_walker_"alex&rylie'smommy"	I wanted my daughter to be able to listen to music without headphones.  This product, the FP3 Speakers, was perfect.  She loves to walk around from room to room singing her favorite songs and carrying this around.  It is easy to turn on and very kid friendly.  The only downfall is that the price dropped right after I purchased it!	1
B0009JE7TC:right_questions_are_the_answers:himmat_shetty_"bookhim"	This is a game that will help you practice, while you are having fun, to ask the right questions, to zero in on the answer and at the same time keeping tab of the progress. I believe it is the right questions that you ask that help you succeed in a game or in life.This is a game with a educational value that will enhance your creative thinking with a dose of fun.If you liked Pictionary you will love Questionary.	1
B000I01T2A:cutest_toy_ever!!!:l._branca	This is absolutely adorable.  Not only is it a great jack in the box for a boy or a girl but you can also play peek a boo with the monkey.  My daughter is 20 months old and she loves it!!!	1
B00000J1E2:a_must_have_for_the_toy_story_gang:d._lupia	Along this is not the most exhilirating toy.  However, my son has collected many of the Toy Story Toys and enjoys playing with all of them together.  For any child who does this you need to have Slinky Do	1

B000GPWOU8:awesome_action_figure:jose_c._coria	This is perfect for any Kurt Cobain/Nirvana fan. It looks great, definitely reminiscent of the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video. I bought it as a gift but almost kept it for myself! If you are thinking of getting it, I would recommend you do so. You won't be disappointed	1
B0007Q1IP8:mille_bornes:benjamin_e._holmes	I remember playing this game as a kid.	1
B00000IZPU:addictive_and_entertaining:	This is a challenging game, even for adults.  It's great for getting both sides of your brain going.  Questions range from easy to difficult and topics cover pop culture, history, and science. Great game to play with  teams	1
B0006HCA78:must_have_for_more_people_and_more_fun:scubasteve	This pack makes this game more fun and allows more people.  The rules change a little when using it, but they are easy to understand and lots of fun.  I highly recommend getting this pack if you have ever wanted to play with more people	1
B0001WGIBW:good_first_step_to_expansion,_good_value_(relatively):my_3_sons	This is a great (and relatively cheap) way to expand your Brio starter set.  A nice selection of straights, curves, and a few switch tracks that really add to the interaction / fun.	1

B000AFGV1W:an_old_favorite_gets_a_new_cover:james_ferguson	Now you can add Risk to your libary in this handsome bookshelf edition.  The game remains a perennial favorite, and in this day and age of global conquest you can play out your vicarious need to be king of the world without harming anyone, atleast not physically.  But, be prepared for a few bruised egos, especially when combatants start teaming up on weaker victims.  While the places and names don't exactly match today's geographical boundaries, kids can still get some sense of the world in which we live, even if the object of the game remains to wipe each other out	1

B00000IWHS:up_with_upwords:p._kellner	Our family loves this game and has played it for years.  The tiles on this version are smaller than the original and some might find them difficult to handle.  If you like Scrabble, you will love this game!	1
B00000JIFK:the_password_is...:michael_kerner_"michael_kerner"	I definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game. Unfortunately, that absolutely isn't always the case. One of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the 80's was Super Password with Bert Convy. The game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle. This edition doesn't reflect on that edition. This board game edition is a example of the original Password with the late Allen Ludden. The game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven't seen the original Password like myself, but it is just delightful. Unfortunately, it isn't much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the Bert Convy edition. Hopefully, when Password is remade, it will be just like the themed 80's edition of the NBC game show.	1
B000DLAXL2:octotunes_entertains:barbara_c._lidestri_"bug_lady"	My 9 month-old granddaughter likes her Christmas present of Octotune;  as a matter of fact, we played with this toy yesterday when I stayed with her.  It is colorful, she can grab the legs and the music is pleasing, so it stimulates more than one sense.	1
B000KI9HMY:very_nice_chess_set:m._reinhardt_"pogo"	This was a gift to my Grand Sons (10 & 7).  They were well pleased with it.  The 10 year old has joined a Chess Club after school.	1
B000087BE6:a_ton_of_fun:titan_fan	we received this for my daughter's 4th birthday.  it has been a lot of fun to play--simple enough for her to play, and hard enough to grow with her for the past year.  although it has a lot of pieces, they have remained durable and have withstood tiny fingers.	1
B000096PLS:awsome_car:	it is fun to play with and kind of educational because you have to strap the babies in their car seats	1
B000BWAC50:serves_it's_purpose:c._crawford	It is an okay seat. My only complaint is that my son has slightly chubby legs and the area on the chair where his legs go and the whole "pummel" thing seem kind of tight and uncomfortable for him. We started him in it at about 4 months. He sits in it for only short periods of time, he gets uncomfortable pretty fast. Otherwise, a decent chair	1
B0006U6HJW:highly_functional,_affordable_a_great_looking.:picky_mom_of_2_boys	We recently purchased this toy storage unit for our 22 month old son and we couldn't be happier. It is sturdy and durable..a hard combination to find these days, looks great but most of all is very functional and user friendly!! It only requires 14 screws to assemble and it looks great. Our son can't wait to get up and play, yelling toy box and jumping out of bed to grab a bin.I will purchase more of these for the different "toy" areas of our home and would certainly give it as a gift	1

B0006SH3X8:star_wars_clone_trooper_blaster:a._woodward	My son needed this gun to go with his Halloween costume.  Needless to say he was thrilled with it.  It has held up under a lot of use, and the noise is not too loud and irritating.	1
B000K68G50:the_best_game:leenbean_"leenbean"	The is one of the fastest and easiest to learn games I have ever played.  The first time we played was on Christmas Day.  We had 10 players that ranged from 16 years to 77 years and everyone loved it.  We played for over 3 hours and decided we had to stop to eat.  It is also a great way to break the ice.  I would recommend this game to anyone whether you are a big game player or a beginner, this game can't be beat	1

30291	Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry	0
60848	the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie	0
73277	I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud	0
103260	I was very disappointed. The acting by the principles was fine, but I think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by Bob Fosse. I think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs. The following tunes from the original show were left out - Near To You, We've Got To Think About the Game, A Man Doesn't Know. And Applegate's tune, The Good Old Days, was abridged. A new tune, There's Something About an Empty Chair, was added to replace Near To You, but it was very weak. I wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they've done recently with Music Man and Bye Bye Birdie	0
128891	I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).	0
140762	I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard	0

164849	The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen.

176703	Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.	0
194935	This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?	0
215645	Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a "nude scene" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off.	0
227067	Chuck Jones continues to entertain new audiences with the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote. Chariots of fur is an blend of his final cartoon with the duo. I found it to be very exciting. If you have Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote The Classic Chase from Warner Bros. Golden Jubiliee 24 Karat collection, this video might not be for you. The other five cartoons actually appear on that video; Zip N' Snort, Operation: Rabbit, Hook, Line and Stinker, Beep Beep, and Ready, Woolen and Able. Otherwise this is an very nice cartoon video collection for kids of all ages	0

265815	An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot;.  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me. If you haven't seen either, see the better of the two (exact same stories): Eat Drink Man Woman	0
279729	This movie made me sick to my stomach. Here we have a woman like Nora Ephron, a woman with professional job skills and talent and when she marries, she turns into a needy, desperate women whom evidently believes her own self-worth is determined by having babies, one after another. I ususally love all of Meryl's movies, but I could not stand seeing her turn into a needy, always pregnant &quot;homemaker&quot;. If I were a man, I would have run awary screaming, too	0

347559	The problem with this film is I read the book.  I was disappointed simply because `Be Cool' is an obvious showcase for the musical talent.  The overly long dance sequence with John Travolta and Uma Thurman is a prime example.  Somewhere the bulk of the story was lost--and there are some very--very good characters appearing in the film that would've been more intersing if somebody would've said, "HEY, don't forget the book!"  But being true to the original source is not Hollywood's strong suit.  "Be Cool" provides some popular music, some known faces, but without John Travolta, the movie would never have been made.	0
352370	This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version.	0
367495	While many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare, there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted, yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror.	0
384125	The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed	0
397308	Man, I don't know what the other reviewers of this movie were smoking, but it should be illegal!  This is, first off, a terrible DVD: 4:3 (full screen) format, with a dark, muddy picture.  Worse, the plot is typical, predictable, and poorly written.  Other than looking for glimpses of Teri Hatcher's body, sitting through this fiasco is a total bore.  I was also surprised at how bad Teri's acting was in this movie, since I've seen her do much better in things she was in previous to this.  That is probably the fault of the director, Erik Anjou, a third-rate director (at best!) who has done a total of two movies and one documentary.  Gee, I wonder why he isn't in more demand (NOT!)!	0
414411	The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film	0
440313	I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is	0

500503	Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly	0

6300184250:burned_out:anthony_petti_"high_school_teacher"	It's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to Hollywood for a new version of "Fahrenehit 451".  Although I appreciate what Truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties, the movie just does not hold up well in 2007, particularly when shown in a high school classroom.  Advancements in CGI could transform Bradbury's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller.  My students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically.  That being said, the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie didn't satisfy their understanding.  Lose the wires on the jet packs!	0

B000I9X53W:tootsie:sandra_"sandra"	To begin with the movie Tootsie is classified as a genre of romance and comic.This movie is produced in New York. The protagonist is Michael Dorsey and he is the most important character in the film.The situation of this movie is of a man that is a talent actor but for reasons of money he decides to dress like a woman.For the reason that he cannot continue woring in the job he has and that his manager tell him nobody would hire him because he is unemployed  by that time. So there is where Dorothy appears and he starts working as a women is a soap opera in televison where he becames so famous. He gets the job here but he did it without having the intention of hurting anyone and also anyone in the place knew that he was a man dresses like a woman.In addition he falls in love with one of the woman that works with him in the soap opera. Thre is only one friend that knows what he is doing. He has one problem and is that his bestfriend falls in love with him but he didn't treat her well for the reason that he is in love with the other woman.The characters of this movie are really good actors evryone seems to knoe what they are doing.THe way the character acts in the movie is ok and the decision the man takes to wear  women's clothin instead of try to find a job in the way he is seems to me very intelligent. Because he could only accept that he was unemployed but no he decides to do something so that he could work. The stes in the movie are really well done and I like the part where the father of the woman that acts in the ospa opera gives a ring to dorothy without knowing thta she was a man.The lightnoing is was ok in every scene you could see everything ok and well iluminated. The costumes the actors used where a little diffrerent form he ones we use right now but eventhough they were not the same they look ok.Furthermore th emusic they put inspires the movie to look more interesting, there were not that much music but it was ok. This movie could be reall in life because  sometimes when people dont have jobs or they got fire they do everything they can to have a job.	0
0800193199:texas_chainsaw_crapsacre:menacing_thunder_"the_sect_of_doom"	This movie is far from being anything great. Some of the characters don't make any sense what so ever with the original cast. Leatherface's role has been mocked. People spend too much time focusing on the other people rather than build up Leatherface. The first TCM is a classic. And the second TCM is great as well. But Leatherface: TCM III, The Next Generation, and the TCM remake have all made the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise a laughing stock. I really hate new directors coming into the horror scene just to mess it up. The only thing they do these days is make crappy remakes and fill horror movies up with CGI. Enough is enough.	0
B0000C508P:even_kink_can_be_boring:william_a._smith_"polymath"	If you crave a gay-themed film full of brooding obsession, gloomy (and very well done) night photography, the occasional graphic sex scene, and METAPHORS so obvious even a high school film class could catch them, then this just might be your cup of tea.

B000HZGNH2:didn't_really_do_it_for_me:gregory_masciola	I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense.	0

6305746370:bad_times:	VE2 has a ton of potential, but it just doesn't work out.  Brandy Davis is both cute and sexy, of course, but Playboy's Testing the Limits is a much better showcase for her, um, talents.  Not to be mean, but most of the film's other women just aren't that attractive, and many of the sex scenes are actually irritating because of the obnoxious soundtrack.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, the massage scene is fairly ordinary.  The girl-girl stripper scene is the most disappointing, however.  It starts really well, with the straight girl gradually overcoming her shyness and enjoying the stripper, but even the unrated version then fades to black without any real action.  The only scene worth watching at all is blue-collar vignette, with two girls and one guy hooking up. Stay away from this one	0

B000JIOA5O:super-awful:	It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her	0

B000LY5AN2:represents_an_ad_nauseam_theme_of_post-60s_hollywood.:milo_d._cooper_"milo_d._cooper"	Like so many Hollywood movies -- especially anything made after the late 60s, when America's teen-agers and collegiate students started taking their typically youthful antiestablishmentarianism with them into the future -- this is another passionate rage against the allegedly oppressive machine.  See The Shawshank Redemption, see Dead Poet's Society, see With Honors -- filmdom's lock-step march against authority is a mainstay of the past three or four decades.  Naturally, this movie is revered as something of a paragon if not a modern pioneer of the trend.  In regular Hollywood fashion, Nurse Ratched (the chief antagonist) and the cuckoos' restrictive environment are portrayed with just enough ambiguity to deflect charges that the movie is a paranoid feast for leftist sensibilities -- which it is, of course.  Unlike most fare of this sort, it is at least very competently crafted (the director and the actors sympathize with the source material enough to give it their all), which no doubt explains how it won one or two more of those little golden trophies than it would have gotten otherwise.  -- M.

If that's your thing, why not just rent a bad softcore porn film and be done with it? At least then you won't have to listen to the cornball pseudo-artistic dialogue in this film. What a crock. They could at least have cast a fine young sista like Rosario Dawson or Gabrielle Union to make this movie moan and squeal! This movie makes sex seem boring	0
B00004RQKN:forget_it.:puzzle_box_"smockey_421"	What this film has is an interesting premise and storyline but unfortunatley it becomes to silly and ridicoulos and the car chase scenes didn't help either. Bruce Willis plays the part of a psychologist that while on vacation visits a friend of his Bob Moore who is also a psychologist and is later murdered and the chief suspect is in his therapy group, Bob is determined to find the killer and is also helped by a detective. There is also a young atractive woman played by Jane March who gets involved with Bruce willis's character Dr. Bill Capa, the films only intresting thing is the therapy group itself which has some odd characters otherwise the film was a lame attempt of being a thriller. Now I'm not a big fan of Bruce Willis but I have seen much better films with him in it than this including Die hard trilogy, last man standing and the sixth sense	0

6300198308:1.75_stars:_it's_hard_to_give_this_movie_any_credit.:horrorman	After watching "Anthropophagus- The Grim Reaper", I came away with mixed feelings.  On the one hand, "Anthropohagus" had its moments (albeit quite few) where it was somewhat chilling.  The Anthropohagus, himself, was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain.  Some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror, but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between.  Unfortunately, the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie, and for some reason, it is just very difficult to get over this fact in "Anthropophagus" probably because these weaknesses are so glaring.	0
6302276187:big_bird_too_whiney:corey_hartman_"c_hartman"	I bought this DVD for my daughter who is from China and though I think Xiao Foo is adorable, I am disappointed by Big Bird's behavior. Not only does he seem frustrated every time the slightest thing does not go his way, but he tells Barkley at one point to "sic" the Monkey King and then later, again frustrated, tells the Monkey King to put his dukes up (as if to fight to resolve the issue). I am appalled by this.  Big Bird is also somewhat demeaning to the Chinese people he encounters--they don't understand him because he is speaking English and rather than explain the language barrier, he just gets upset. I love Sesame Street, and although I will keep this DVD to hear Xiao Foo sing in Chapter 7 (our daughter just loves her), I feel I will need to use Big Bird's behavior as an example of how not to act	0

Van Damme kicks more butt and does more corny things then he did in Double Team. with horrible dialouge and a plot that seems like it came from some guy wiping his ass with a piece of toilet paper and then saw it on the piece of paper and said HEY!!!! damnit, lets make a movie about this piece of crap right here	0
B0000CBY21:what_else_is_new?:stephen_e._gruber	This is not the first interview that Fra. Junge has given. View the sensational 1974 documentary, "The World At War,' narrated by Lord Laurence Olivier, and you will see a much younger Junge musing over her tenure with Hitler. Most of the information that she provides in this documentary was given in "The World At War." The 1974 documentary is filled with footage of Hitler. Having had relatives who were in Germany at the time, and personally knowing former German soldiers and officers, I find it difficult to believe that Junge did not know of the Nazi Death camps as both rumors and hard evidence surfaced while they were going on. I believe she knew but because of the fact that she was so taken by Hitler, perhaps she did not want to believe the rumors. My mother personally met Hitler when she was 15 and was totally mezmerized by his apparent charm and grace. At any rate, "Blind Spot" repeats "The World At War" interviews, and is a "talking head" that would have been better produced with raw footage with voice-over. The three stars is for effort, minus one star for "nothing new" and minus another star for German and not English (English sub-titles). The younger Frau spoke good English in 1974 but is lost in "Blind Spot."  S	0

6304737491:not_for_rogers_and_hammerstein_fans...:catwoman_"seminary_bookworm"	Rogers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella" is one of my favorite musicals ever! But does this rendition do it justice? Absolutely not!!!!! More glitz and fancier costumes do not a make a better musical by any means. Maybe if I was not enamored with Leslie Ann Warren or Julie Andrews who make far better Cinderellas I would have enjoyed this. I am not against a politically correct image like this story attempts but if it was done tastefully i would have appreciated it better. If you are a Rogers and Hammerstein fan like I am, you want to watch it anyway but its not merely as charming as the other ones. Its ALOT more exciting that the Julie Andrews version was recently found save your money and buy that one. However a younger audience or an audience that was not enamored with the other Rogers and Hammerstein Cinderellas will appreciate it far better	0
B00004CK4J:negative_5_stars!:james	Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back	0
6301744128:up,_up_and_away...:bindy_sue_frnknschtein_"bigfootsalienbaby"	Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head..	0
6303355102:worthless,_except_for_tarantino's_cameo:a._o._sheepfielder	"Sleep with Me" would be completely worthless if not for a Quentin Tarantino cameo in which he riffs on the homosexual undertones of "Top Gun."  That lasts about two minutes.  The remainder of the film is just dull relationship philosophy spouted by pretentious, ersatz neo-Bohemian characters. Except for Tarantino's "Top Gun" bit (and the twenty seconds or so when Parker Posey has her shirt off) there's nothing worthwhile here	0

French people are not pretty, and this woman was not only NOT pretty, but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma.  Even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog.  Save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience	0

B00005O5L7:the_horror!__the_horror!:david_baldwin	Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls"	0

What makes this movie memorably, remarkably bad is writer/director/star Eric Schaeffer's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard, which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday's roadkill. The mere fact that the photogenically-challenged Mr. Schaeffer should have the likes of Elle MacPherson tell him he's "cute" speaks volumes	0

Ethan Hawke leans to heavily on Kris Kristofferson's performances not to mention Jeff Tweedy's music. As a matter of fact the only gleaming light in the movie is the music. It is written interestingly enough, but the visuals look like there wasn't enough money in the budget to clean up the cheap video that it was shot on. The best way to watch this movie is in the background. You don't need the visuals, and if you dare watch them you will get dreary eyed and fade away	0

The plot and characters were excellent, it rated up there with the best of them I would give ST1 5 stars. I saw this was on sale for a great price so I got it expecting great things. Usually sequels aren't to par with the originals so I at least expeted a 3-star movie. When i flipped on the movie i said "WOW....right where they left off" at a pretty good battle seen with the BUGS. Well, that was it I was waiting for more action. I waited....I waited...I waited and I waited...they made the plot intersting with occasional nudity but it still wasn't worth it. I don't know who's idea it was for the sequel but I hope this was their last one. I'll stick with the new Battlestar Galactic and Star Trek reruns	0

But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy.

And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher.

But my biggest problem was, im not even sure.It was boring and not that interesting.We dont even get to see Bridgette cause mayhem as a wolf.Ghost is really annoying to watch in the film and well i just didnt like this one. I dont understand what people loved aboput this film.The only thing that kept me interested was the fact that its Bridgett and actually Ginger Snaps.I love the sisters characters.But this film just wasnt all that good at all.

B00004RW5D:one_beautifully_filmed_butchered_mess_of_a_movie!!!!!!!!:brian_kerr_"brian_kerr"	If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure.This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through.Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out "something" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,"WHAT???!!!" This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda.Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events.There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands.It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes!Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the noferious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed "butchered" mess of a movie.2*'s because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so lovely,but nay a farthing more!!	0

B00005IARC:the_thousand_injuries_of_fortunado:d._j._cole	First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars.

6302668603:could_be_such_a_great_movie...:a._lejeune_"scarlettdoll"	...but, sadly, falls way short.  They have a great storyline with a twisted triangle and intense power struggles but the filming is so choppy that one scene ends and the next begins, sometimes with no connection.  The scenes do not blend into each other, forming a movie that is pleasant to watch.  This movie jumps from one place to another that seems to contradict but with no explanation of the change.  One scene the main girl is wildly in love with her husband, is forgiving of the king's adulterous intentions and is supremely happy.  Shortly thereafter, she wants revenge on every person she's ever met. Yes, she was betrayed, in a way, but not by EVERYone.  The only real high point of the movie is Timothy Dalton, who is a great actor, but this was a lousy setting for his talent.  Also, considering the plot of the movie, there were no intimate scenes.  The only thing that happens in the bedroom is the king beats the girl and he nurses her back from smallpox.  All in all, this story had great potential that was sadly wasted in this movie	0

But his performance in  &quot;Live and Smokin&quot; shows he's still just a rookie.  He's nervous in front of the camera, and says so several times. His material   is typically raunchy, but not very funny. You can hear the forced laughter from a few members of the audience. Buy this tape only if you're a die-hard Pryor fan, but don't expect the side-splitting laughter you'll get from &quot;In Concert&quot;, &quot;Live on the Sunset Strip&quot;, and &quot;Here and Now&quot;	0

I wasn't old enough at the time, but I'm sure fans were slightly bemused at the re-emergence of Friday the 13th.  Tommy, now a teenager (and a bloody old one at that) is residing at the local mental institution still traumatised by the terror of Jason and also the death of his mother.  Tommy is plagued by dreams and nightmares convinced that Jason is back from the dead.  And it seems he may be right, when a series of murders begins. But who could it possibly be THIS time.

B00006HBUG:boy,_do_i_miss_luke,_han_and_leia:leon_alvarado_"movie_connoisseur"	Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of "holes" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and "Attack of the Clones" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the "Ultimate Enhanced Version" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch "Serenity" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of "Mannequin" to "Annakin" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story	0

B000094P3R:exploitation_versus_art--ingmar_bergman's_oscar_winner_and_wes_craven's_shocker_tell_the_same_tale:k._harris_"film_aficionado"	There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.	0
079074192X:should_be_forgotten.:m._case_"sag;_ace;_ase;_dga"	As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found "Altered States", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of "hack movie making". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity	0
6304244703:"shameless"_insufficient_use_of_jeremy_brett:bonnie_burton	I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist. It's a bizarre experience to witness an actor -- who so perfectly embodied the iconic Sherlock Holmes in the beloved Granada TV series -- appear in such an odd role of a drug-supplying sugar daddy. It's even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern-day sexual scene with a young woman. Regardless, as usual, he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it. I only wished the director has used Brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric.	0
B000B64TOQ:for_what_they_are_worth_,_my_thoughts._flashes_of_the_seagal_of_old,_and_a_step_up_from_submerged.:ollie	Much like Into The Sun, this had all the ingredients for a Seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another Seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great Seagal action thriller. The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. "Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer", what was that all about??  The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed. Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late. However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it. In Seagals post Exit Wounds years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and his best since Exit Wounds,  with Half Past Dead, Out Of Reach and The Foreigner(&lt;-- I know people may want to decapitate me for saying that but I like The Foreigner!) following behind. The worst for my viewing pleasure has to be Out For A Kill, Ticker and Submerged(although enjoyable in a it's so bad it's good, kind of way). I'd put Today You Die and Into The Sun in the same box as missed opportunities for two excellent Seagal movies	0

6304938225:lack_of_balance_leads_to_lack_of_credibility.:l_gontzes	In short, the film does a fairly good job of getting the message across, as it should do, in making people aware of the evils of war and the fact that the international community is often slow to act. At the same time, however, it does not provide a balanced examination of the situation on the ground, which only weakens the very effect it is trying to create.	0
078062775X:the_benevolent_master:raquel_b.	I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans	0

0764005715:d-tv..._:bindy_sue_frnknschtein_"bigfootsalienbaby"	No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...	0

B00004CIHN:cheeze-corn...:bindy_sue_frnknschtein_"bigfootsalienbaby"	I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...	0

Those who love J.Lo will declare the greathess of this movie, in a variety of ways.  Those who hate J.Lo will counter their every point in describing how bad it is. And those who love quality film won't waste too much time even recognizing that this movie even exists. Guilty pleasure, indeed! One thing you have to admit about J.Lo, she's consistent. She sings bad, acts bad, and is merely eye candy, for thoe who find her appealing. And this movie is full of all of the above, plus awful, cliche ridden, emotionally pleading writing that should be an inspiration to anyone with Hollywood writing aspirations, since this movie demonstrates how little talent it takes. At least it's had it's short, but sill way too long presence on the premium movie channels, cause for a while this piece of garbage was ubiquitous, just like the lead starlett. Maniupulative only begins to describe this drek. But that said, it's more than enough time wasted on this movie. I merely felt compelled to warn folks. Don't waste your time. It stinks	0
8315	THis was the first scary movie I ever saw in the cinema, and it made a strong impression on me. The bathtub scenes were so eerie that I only took showers for a few years after I saw this movie at 15 - that is how much it scared me. I have since watched it as an adult and was able to keep it in healthier perspective, although I do have to say it is pretty scary and well done. Watching it many years later, I was surprised that it lacked a lot of the 70's cheese that you see in many films from that era. The carpet and some of the clothes were funny, but it didn't detract from the film. Glad I bought it	1
56587	I will begin by saying that this movie by no means touches on a new plot. The 'geek' boy falls in love with the alternative girl, while she's already fallen for someone else, who is a complete jerk. Of course, they end up together in the end. However, most movies are bought for the newness, the originality, and are watched once or twice and forgotten on a dusty shelf. This movie captures attention through other avenues. The characters are charming, and everyone will relate to this movie, and say 'hey, that sounds like someone I know'. Ths soundtrack is fabulous, and the movie includes a segment of a live performance by Everclear, that, although short, is very impressive. My advice: Rent this. If you like it the first time you see it, then proceed to buy it, because you always will. If you're not keen on it, then don't bother	1
81223	For me, &quot;Get a Life&quot; provided plenty of laughs in its spoofs of what often manages to pass as television comedy, from Chris' unique effort to rehabilitate a collection of street punks to his discovery of a space  alien (in home video Volume 2) which is anything but cuddly. I only wish  Rhino would expand its offerings of &quot;Get a Life&quot; episodes	1
103262	Certain movies really capture the feel of their themes, and this one is the one movie that really captures the magic of Baseball like no other. Of course there is a great moral lesson to be learned. But haven't we learned by now, that the Devil has no good purpose in wanting to help us to achieve our goals? I hope so. What a great cast of performers. Nothing was lost from the Broadway stage in this production. And nothing is lost from the movie in this excellent transfer to DVD. Through the magic of Hollywood, when done to perfection, film can even enhance the story. And few have done the job with a Musical as well as this Gem. Thanks largely to the astounding talent of Bob Fosse's choreography. Tab Hunter's shining moment. Gwen Verdon's 'Whatever Lola Wants' is the showstopper, but Ray Walston steals the entire film as an extremely funny Devil. A film favorite for most of my life	1
114440	Micky Dane (Robert Patrick), a paparazzo photographer, is on the run after a photo shoot that leaves him framed for murder. This movie has great action, good acting and really catchy music. Body Shot is another Robert Patrick movie that I've seen multiple times(probably about 12 so far and still counting).  You gotta love Patrick with his blond hair! I AM biased and give this a perfect 5 stars	1
124143	I just watched the second half of Guarding Tess on TBS. It's now 11:30PM, and I am writing this review when I should be in bed 1 and half hour ago. Nicolas Cade and The old woman in the movie both turned in great performances. The story was lightly funny at first, but didn't really go anywhere. The relationship between The FBI agent and ex-first lady was strange, and though the movie tried to give their intimacy an explanation, it was still weird. The climax came at the end, and was very entertaining, for it broke a long line of fairly boring plot. There is much meaning in the movie; it tried successfully to bring the emotions of a smart first lady widow who dearly wants attention to life. I was touched by the movie. Thank you. I should go to bed now	1
129251	This movie is a classic - a young(er) Nicholas Cage is fun to watch, as is the entire cast!  One of my favorites to watch over and over!!	1
134318	as an asian american, i just want to say how well this movie is made.  i'm not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors (come on people, this was in the 1930s!!)  and yes, there are a few scenes that are not in the book.  but, let's count how many hollywood movies (taken from books) that can't hold a candle to it's original masterpiece.  i love the movie 'misery' but if you've read the book, the book outshines the movie by a landslide.  so yes, the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book, but still a very well made movie nonetheless, particularly for the 1930s.  i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd	1
143812	This movie is great. I remember watching it when I was really young. Im 21 now and still love it. Yeah some things are corny but that is part of what makes it great. Its not suppose to be realistic. Its fiction! I just realized too that the daughter is the girl from American Pie which makes it even funnier. Overall this movie is pretty good. If you dont care for the story, atleast get it to see Kim and the other chicks in the movie. If you've never seen the movie, just buy it. Its about the same as renting it a couple times and you will be able to keep it. For all you people who rated it a 1 you have issues!	1
147049	What do an environmentalist, a firefighter and a chain-store executive have in common?  Quite a bit according to this joy of a film.  David O. Russell and Jeff Baena have written a highly intelligent comedy about a man who's trying to make sense of his life.  That man is Albert Markovski (Jason Schwartzman), a founder of a group called the Open Space Coalition who are trying to preserve forest and marsh area's where big business want to tear it down.  In his latest attempt he's joined forces with a chain-store known as Huckabees whose exec on the way up Brad Stand (Jude Law) seems to have a hidden agenda.  All this aside, Albert is troubled by a very tall African teenager that has crossed his path on three occasions and he is convinced this coincidence has substantial meaning in his life, so he seeks out the help of Vivian & Bernard Jaffe (Tomlin and Hoffman), two existential detectives, hiring them to follow his every move to decipher how his life makes sense.	1
157270	Received my moive as quickly as promised and have had no problems	1
174333	This movie will make you laugh and cry with a who's who of hollywood.  The music alone will move you to the kleenex box.  If you have lost someone to aids, this movie will touch you deeply.  I was told not to watch this movie alone.  Watch it with someone to hug.  How right they were.  Bronson Pinchot playing comic relief was a stereotype of the obnoxious friend a lot of us have.  Eric Roberts and Gregory Harrison have a chemistry eerily familiar to many gay couples I know.  Bravo!  Get the soundtrack too for those rainy days when you just want to reflect	1
188323	Peter Dinklage may be the one of the most unlikely sex symbols ever to assay the role of A Stranger Comes To Town, but that's part of what makes this charming character study so offbeat and unforgettable.  As Finn, a dwarf who has just inherited an abandoned train station in Newfoundland, NJ, Dinklage carries the story on his small but exceptionally sturdy back, never begging the audience's sympathy but conveying worlds of anger, hurt, bewilderment and amusement in his dark eyes.  (His rumbly, seductive voice doesn't hurt either.)  As a local resident with a tragic past, Patricia Clarkson adds to her litany of complex women characters (and provides some of the film's biggest laughs when behind the wheel of her SUV), with stellar support from a garrulous Bobby Cannavale and a luminous Michelle Williams.  Settle into the film's gracious, generous rhythms and prepare to feel absolutely wonderful	1
194936	Setting & Theme(s): Castlerock, smallville, summer friends' adventure, life's lessons, solidarity found in kinsmanship and standing tall against the unknown.	1
218071	HA!  Great movie, plot, performances and insights!  Gotta see this one, at least once, for experiencing a truly under-rated masterpiece.  My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.	1
225296	this movie is about Christian Slater (Heathers, True Romance) who plays Hard Harry the pirate radio man of his pirated show. this is a movie that deals with rebellion and teen angst..kids who want to live their lives free of all the things they are imprisoned to do and they tune into Slater's show everynight to listen to him speak it loud and proud. Samantha Mathis' (Broken Arrow, That Thing Called Love) film debut...this is number 1 out of the 3 movies her and Slater star together in. Cheryl Pollack (My Best Friend Is A Vampire) is hotter then ever. Slater's flawless performance and unforgettable moments make this one a masterpiece and a movie not to be forgotten, one of the best movies of 1990. Also starring Mimi Kennedy (Tv's Dharma and Greg), Scott Paulin, Andy Romano, Ellen Greene (Talk Radio) and Billy Morrisey (Severed Ties) co-star. note: Seth Green (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Party Monster) has a short but recognizable role in here and so does Martin Landau's daughter Juliet Landau (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Ed Wood).	1
239166	I cannot believe how mean and down-dirty elections can get when they get too close.  Does it tell us something about the election process.  It needs to become kinder.   Democracy can be great if we work a little harder at it.  It can be done!	1
252894	V for Vendetta was already out on DVD before I finally saw it. My college roommates told me that it was a great movie, so I finally went to blockbuster and rented a copy. The next day I returned the copy and went to Best Buy and bought my own copy of the movie, it was that good.	1
263088	"El-Hazard: The Magnificent World" is an anime very much in the "Tenchi Muyo!" mold: a romantic comedy/adventure in which blank-slate protagonist Makoto is thrust into a sci-fi scenario and gets to play hero while being chased by multiple women. Though the characters in "El-Hazard" aren't developed as deeply as the "Tenchi" crew and the show occasionally suffers from awkward pacing, "El-Hazard" has a charm all it own. The mysterious antiheroine Ifurita is compelling, and the kids' hard-drinking teacher Fujisawa is consistently funny. Most impressively, "El-Hazard" tells a complete and satisfying story, tying up its seeming plot holes with an ingenious last-episode twist. Usually these types of shows start strong, only to end up limping through anticlimaxes and false endings. Even the romantic tension is unambiguously resolved!	1
275419	I must say that I am generally not interested in watching a romance movie, but this movie is a definite exception. It "Possessed" a great soundtrack that fit the scenes perfectly, captivating scenery that is incredible, and a cast that perfectly fits the mold of the story. From beginning to end it was an absolute success of a complete movie. It piques the curiosity, it warms the heart, and it even manages to make you feel slightly better about life after watching it. buy it, you won't regret it	1
285648	This story is so fascinating that I couldn't stop feeling that the drive to create and to be true to one's identity and sexual preference had to be overwhelming to cause the writer, Arenas, to survive and escape the homophobic surroundings in Cuba under Castro.  Johnny Depp is unbelievably wonderful as both the sadistic lieutenant and the transporting Drag Queen	1
290145	This is by far my favorite musical, not the concert but the actual musical from the 70's. When i saw Alexis Smith the first time i fell deeply in love. Of course i was only 24 at the time.Even though this is just the concert version minus the terrible cutting and editing it's better than nothing at all. This cast was also wonderful with it's vintage and well polished cast, I gave it the four stars only because it's not as complete as the CD. After all most of the people that would buy the concert version would also have been fans of the original show itself so why not include all the production numbers.Maybe if enough people make compaints do you think they may re-do this DVD?To all those wonderful women who were in the original production,,,Hats off, to those wonderful girls.. The likes of this will never come again	1
301792	This is not only a thrilling story on the life of a group of African Americans but it also captures the reality of the streets of L.A. As you watch the movie you see the life surrounding this group of black friends. You truly become attached to the characters and begin to feel that they cant do anything to escape the struggle they have been in since they were born. Ice Cube the main character plays a gangbanger who is living the life of a criminal, from fights on the corner, to drive by shootings.	1
317049	On a June evening in 1968 I was awakened by my dad, a Marine Raider and one of the Chosen Few, at ten o'clock PM, that's 2200, to watch The DI... five hours before I was to report to the Armed Forces Induction Center, Oakland, Calif. I won't ever forget that movie session with my dad, and as one other person commented, ya never forget your DIs, mine were SSgt Gonzales, SSgt Rogers, and Cpl Sexton.	1
328448	As someone well versed in various kinds of literature, someone who has read (and enjoyed) almost all of Tom Clancy's novels, and as a professional videographer, I have to say, this is a great flick.	1
341056	My two and three year olds have almost all the Baby Einstein DVD and this is one of their favorite.  They beg to watch it and laugh out loud at the puppets.  As usual, I am happy with the classical music, art work, and learning elements	1
350995	This is a good old fashioned film similar to the English film 'Goodbye Mr Chips'.  It has lots of old fashioned values and contains humour, pathos, passion and sentimentality which will tug at the heart strings!!!  I defy anyone not to have a lump in the throat or a tear in the eye when the long awaited Marr baby dies shortly after birth, or when James 'Red' Sandstrom Jr. comes to vist Marty at Christmas with his mother.  I just love the whole tone of the film - the director has got the atmosphere just right.  A real cracker of a film lacking in any real violence or nastiness I am pleased to say.  It is a film I can watch again and again.  Even my husband, normally quite reticent with such films, was impressed.  That to me was praise indeed	1
366788	This film motivated me to do my own research and I read as much material on the case as I could possibly find--especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty.  To be honest, I had a natural skepticism about the West Memphis Three's claims of innocence.  A coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her "friends" who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder.  I refused to believe it at first.  But it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive.  Still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends' innocence.  When all is done and said - it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts.	1
375594	This movie is based on reality in which the boxer Ruben Carter was wrongfully accused of murder. It shows how awful racism was and that makes one feel horrible. Just because Carter was black, he was imprisoned. This film is remarquable and Denzel Washington is absolutely fantastic as Ruben Carter. It shows his wrong accusation, the racism, and his descent into madness in prison. It's very sad but the ending ends out being a happy ending. Ruben Carter is helped by a group of Canadians who are inspired by his book that he had written and they try to help him get released from prison. It's a beautiful story and deserves to be watched by everyone. This movie is up there for me with films like the Shawnshank Redemption and the Green Mile! Highly reccomended	1
385474	Lets start off with how happy I am this finally after all these years got on DVD.	1
400402	This is a masterpiece of cinema. After watching Robert Mulligan's more famous (to me) movies: To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of '42, I found this jewel. I did not think that the same man could create a third work of art but here it is.	1
421441	Into The Blue turned out to be a decent movie. I was not expecting a story or ANYTHING from this movie other than pure eye candy. I was surprised by a decent story with suspense and action and some really beautiful cinematography. The underwater shots are really breathtaking. I also enjoyed the special features on the DVD which demonstrated how these great shots were taken in waters that were both beautiful and shark infested.	1
435765	1st of all if you are a Prince fan, then it is ofcourse the norm, that you have some favortism directed to the film. That would be me included!!! Does he ever not look good on camera??? I love his hair styles throughout the movie. O.K. now on the movie itself; I find the plot of it beautiful. I wish it did; however, show more erotic love scenes. I love the idea of this movie pertaining to the fact to w/ being a male gigolo, and finding love. THIS IS A PRINCE FILM that does not come on to often...this is simply beautiful B&W so clean looking. (...)! to all the naysayers, because Graffiti Bridge is sexy too! This could be a silent film, and I would still get it just to watch him sashay his cute (...)on screen...everything about him is art. More than half of all people even if they tried could not be such as he: An animated piece of expensive art on screen that you want to just watch...cut it out you haters he is GORGEOUS!!	1
452668	Oh God, as a graduate of UAG I should say that this movies is nothing like the movie but I can't lie. The Madera's own the med. school.. the Leano's own the med. school. The Dean does not care about students.... Dean Villalobos and Martinez Sandoval dont care about the students. The infrastructure is a bit outdated.... you guessed it!! UAG's buildings are as old as Fenway without any upgrades.  Oh yeah, the pride and joy of the institution is the infamous PMC program:  "Programa Medicina en Comunidad", just like in the film!!!!   It is a riot! If you plan to go to UAG you must watch this film. If you get a hold of it, bring it down to Guadalajara so you can laugh.	1
462971	This wonderful little book is for you, the student of screenwriting.  How do I know?  I had the good fortune of being in Dr. Claudia Hunter Johnson's screenwriting class at Florida State University.  We used the methods described in her book and they work!  If you are disciplined enough to follow her process, you will amaze yourself.  You will begin with Le Menu (your very own personal autobiography) and finish with a well-crafted script.  Although you will not have her direct feedback, you will have the benefit of a script coach who has helped launch a thousand careers.  Tom	1
486137	Most people I know who have viewed this film fall into two categories. On one side there are those who hate it, while on the other are those who like it. I am of the latter group. This is not a comedy, although one gets the feeling that with so many absurdities in the lives of the characters that make us laugh, it appears to be a comedy. However, make no mistake about it, this brilliant film is more than that. It is a biting satire of a very dark side of life. One I wouldn't wish on anyone.	1
497511	This is the best ABC video I have came across. I bought the VHS for my niece about 10 years ago and I still have that same video. It was passed back to me and now my daughter & son have enjoyed it. It's been through a lot so I decided to buy the DVD and it's great! My kids love it & it's really helped my 2 yr old boy recognize his letters as well as what begins with each letter. I give this video an A	1
509437	I never really knew of Matthew Modine until I saw this movie.  He was very good in the part and I have watched the movie several times. I also purchased the book as well.	1
532464	Given that pornography is a multi-jillion-dollar-a-year business, it's sort of surprising that it hasn't received the cinematic treatment more often, but Boogie Nights provides it with the sort of skewed, darkly comic treatment that it almost certainly deserves, and becomes a certifiable classic in the process.  Following the story of Eddie Adams, a simple-minded, almost impossibly well-endowed teenager from suburban California who achieves porn stardom as Dirk Diggler before turning 20, Boogie Nights is both a time-tested star-is-born-and-almost-blows-it-all story and a loving tribute to a time and place that will probably never be replicated and the individuals who made it what it was.	1
541102	I've seen it on the orginal screen in a theather, saw it many times on the VCR I have.........this new DVD is superior to both in it's clarity, color and a real gem to own	1
550216	A documentary about the making of a film that never got past the shooting of a couple of scenes doesn't seem to promise much, but the story of what was to turn out to be a real-life "disaster movie" is riveting stuff.	1
555567	I lvoed this movie I have been looking for it for years. The story plot is ok but the dancing in the movie is awesome and the music is great. It just wants to make you get up and dance	1
562168	Boyz N the Hood is an oustanding movie about a young man named Tre Styles who grows up on the hostile and violent streets of South Central Los Angeles. After a confrontation with a classmate at his school, Tre's mother forces him to go and live with his father Furious. She says, " The last thing I want is to see you end up a drunk hanging out in front of one of these liquor stores or killed. Look at me, I'm serious. I love you. You're my only son." She just can't take his problems anymore.	1
573460	THis is one of my favorite movies. Besides containing a stellar cast (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Sammuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, DOnald AND Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey) You get the idea. Is there a cast member that ISN't a biggie? The casting is Genious, and the acting incredible. It's suspenseful, deep, VERY emotional.. slightly dark.. it's the perfect movie. Even the rape scene is well done by being comfortably vague while still haunting you.	1
581214	Be sure to catch the Alternate views on Disk 2.  The view from the control booth with the director losing his mind, in a good way, is great.  They also have A Beautiful Day from the rooftop in Boston	1

B000KWTKEK:brian_regan:todd_a._brownlie	First heard his stand-up on CD when I worked at Borders a few years back.  Sometimes he gets a bit carried away (a lotta comics tend to, though), and his comedy comes across dopey, yet easy to relate to.  Clean (no naughty words or uncouth situations here!), family-fun comedy (dirty or clean, as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well, then he/she is funny in my eyes)	1
6304963173:a_real_gem:paul_kummer_"film_buff"	This a wonderful movie. I had never seen it before. I am 65 and was a teenager in the fifties and an avid movie goer. Some of these old black and white films bring back memories of a time when life seemed to begin every moment. It was a time after the war and people were just beginning to discover each other. The old Italian movies had a grittiness to them. A reality from far away places where life just had a different style. La Strada and the Nights of Cabiria were from this time. I feel such a pull watching them, wishing things had never become so modern. The Bicycle Thieves belongs in this catagory. The reproduction is marvelous. Clean and smooth. I am glad that this movie has been restored. Its a beautiful piece of the past.	1

6303032648:enormously_underrated:steve_kandic	Flesh and Bone is an evocative, haunting and rewarding study of a drifting man (played with understated, heartbreaking perfection by Dennis Quaid) who encounters a lost soul (Meg Ryan, outstanding)leaving a violent marriage and begins a tender relationship until a dark figure from his past shows up.	1
6302305950:one_of_the_greatest_screwball_comedies:jonathan_lapin_"fletcher_rabbit"	easily one of the funniest movies ever made. its incredible today to realize that irene dunne never won an oscar, and this year is the most galling of all, as she lost to the ridiculous luise rainer in "the good earth"; and even more galling to realize that cary grant was not even nominated (after all, its only a comedy, right?) but this is a movie that will never age: it makes me laugh as much today as when i first saw it on television thirty years back, and if id been alive to see it in a theater 70 years ago, the response would be the same. dunne and grant excel as a divorcing couple who sabotage each others new relationships, and randolph scott is a miracle as dunnes new fiancee ("not oklahoma city ITSELF?!"). but it is irene dunne who is the star here, and until such time as "theodora goes wild" and "show boat" are finally released on dvd, this is the best of her 30s roles.	1
B00004RCGU:entertaining_wayne_western:yankee2	I like almost everything that Andrew V. McLaglen directs. This film has quite a lot of good things to recommend it. Mostly I like the opening Civil War scene and later Wayne, Rock Hudson and company doing battle with the invading French down in Mexico. There's enough humor, action and emotion to go around not to mention Hugo Montenegro's very good score	1
B000055ZGP:good_choice:diane_alford	Good workout video for only 15 min. per session.After doing the video for 2 weeks straight I could tell the difference.My only complaint was that Tamilee doesn't give very explicit instructions for all of the moves.It was a little hard to follow at first.If you are looking for a decent workout for a small amount of time,this is a good choice	1
6302874521:not_the_most_realistic_movie_but_still_a__great_one:keithotron_"keithotron"	Yes, this movie is kind of unrealistic but so what. And just to re-clear up the bike thing. It wasn't a coaster brake bike like you had on your old banana seat bike when you were a kid. It's a track bike with a fixed gear. Which means the pedals spin as long as the rear wheel spins. And backward pressure slows your speed but does not completely stop it.That why he always jumped off the back and grabed the seat when he wanted to stop quickly. That is also why anyone crazy enough to ride a track bike on the street usually has a front brake installed. Look at the scenes where he is freestyling in his apartment. He is pedaling backward. This can only be done on a fixed gear. No coaster brake. If you look really closely at some of the scenes you will be able to see different bikes. Like when Bacon rides down the stairs, you can see the bike he's on has brakes. Obviously for the stunt. But I really like this movie. I've been a messenger and I always wanted the place I worked to be like that movie. We never went outside and freestyle in the street while the boom box played. And hot girls never gave me their phone number. But we get to see Lawrence Fishburne as Voodoo when was still know as Larry. And that's worth the 13 bucks right there	1
B00004CYD6:one_of_the_best_soundtracks_of_1998:"aznpryde"	This album has pure energy, pure lyrics, pure beats. Everything went right in this soundtrack. Public Enemy seldomly puts out any bad albums. The title song in this album &quot;He Got Game&quot; was a pretty weak song.  The beats were nice though, but this song leans a little towards the blues  and jazz catogorie. That was the only song that I disliked out of 12  tracks. The album starts off with the song Ressurection, that track was so  beautifully produced it sounded way beyond Public Enemy's music. Masta  Killa dropped a verse that was so so tight. Track 3 wit KRS-ONE was one of  the best, number 5 had a cool beat. The rest of the tracks were just Public  Enemy style. This is a great album for a Public Enemy fan	1
B000HZGOC6:the_romance:n._mahaley	Great old time classic.  Don't bother watching the remake with Harrison Ford. This is all you need to see	1
6304441630:last_stand_of_westerns:c._a._luster_"the_rook"	It is truly a pity that the western has died off. They are rare and far between these days. A few years back Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot made a few together and separate. They are all worth seeing. This one has Tom playing Cable, a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the South has lost. It just hasn't been declared yet.

Well, Honey, what do you think? HE SAID: "HOLLYWOOD TRULY IS A LAND OF IMAGINATION AND FANTASY." I SAID: "THAT WAS A GOOD WAR MOVIE."  HE SAID: "THAT WAS NOT A WAR MOVIE, IT WAS A MOVIE ABOUT PERSONALITIES: THERE WAS NO WAR IN THAT MOVIE."  Well, he's right, but, I LIKED THIS MOVIE, AND, I THINK, MOST OTHER PEOPLE WILL TO.	1
B000O19EVQ:john_carpenter's_ghost_of_mars:sherry_phillips_"muse_6000"	This a classic John Carpender film but defentaly one that needs a sequel by him. The skill with which action mixed with heavy metal music is excellent. As far as I'm concerned everyone in this si-fi horror thriller did their job right. I could feel it ,be it , live it. It could be real. Each character brought something essential to this film. I'm not the only one that likened the  martian leader to a cross between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie. There are very powerful fight survival scenes with just enough blood and gore to freak you out and keep you on edge. Who will get possessed next? A must see. More than once to notice all of the effects, and believe me they are powerfull.	1

As a young teenager, this movie was very inspiring (to get involved in martial arts).	1

Eventually he begins to delve himself into his dark toon world and the movie is beautifully animated and stuffed full of creativity, sex, bigotry, and ultimately a true grim view of society. As dark as it sounds I found parts of this movie very amusing. Housewives, pass on this one it's not 'Finding Nemo'. If you enjoy a truly stunning visual experience and dark humor/satire I'd reccomend you watch this....A true must see for the inebriated	1
6301973496:dated,_cheezy,_but_still_better_than_"rudy":mr._sully_"nd94fan"	This movie has a very high "cheese" factor. The most glaring example being when the Notre Dame player scores a touchdown in the 1928 Army game after Rock's rousing "Win One for the Gipper" speech, looks to the sky and says "That's one for the Gipper!" That aside, this is a great movie! It is way better than "Rudy"!!! After all, Rudy's Notre Dame playing career lasted less than even 30 seconds!!! This is the story of the story of the one man who actually BUILT the program for crying out loud!!!! If it wasn't for Rock, Rudy would have never happened! I'll take this story over the one about a hapless janitor any day!!!	1

B00005Q319:this_cat_has_style!:michael_endicott	Sure, it would have been great if the Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss  alliance would have continued for this outing (their "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Horton Hears A Who" are unquestionable classics) but this is a noble effort.. a VERY noble effort.  "The Cat in the Hat" was always been my favorite Dr. Seuss book. Having said that, I felt the top notch vocal talent (Allan Sherman will forever be the Cat in the Hat, sorry Mike Meyers!) and whimsical screenplay really fleshed out the book playful theme ... and the Geisel penned songs were truly inspired!  So the animation is a little off.  This is going to be considered quite the classic when that stinker of a movie opens this winter	1

6301972252:the_eye_of_morning:a._sebastian_catala_"chany_catala"	Mata Hari arrived in Paris and soon began to spin a web of sorcery. Her naked body (that same body that was later to be riddled with bullets)her password to a greedy world of material success.Margaretha Geertruida Zelle MacLeod enjoyed a happy childhood in Holland the darling of a dotting father. Early restlessness brought her to Java, the mail-bride of a brute. There, in Indonesia, amid crushing tragedy and spousal abuse, Gertie absorbed the artistic concepts that will one day found her applauded, then, mowed down by a French firing squad. Poor judgment, and Eastern flair, and a gluttony for men, contrived to make her eternal. But was Gertie a spy? The visionary Irving Thalberg secured the rights to Mata Hari's notebooks and thus MGM began production starring Greta Garbo. I find this 1932 film a work of contrasts. To watch Garbo mise-en-scene through the lens of William Daniels, in a genial atmosphere assembled by Cedric Gibbons, rapturous, is truly a fine thing. MGM's 'Mata Hari' remains a unique accomplishment. Though one wonders how the silly story-theme ever passed Thalberg. There is a dichotomy here, style versus substance (a chronic blemish with some of Garbo's films) The developing narrative is puerile, and mind you, the early thirties boasts many a gritty film. More than an actress Garbo is a virtuosa, a poseur. Thus she offers art more priceless, a curious and singular spiritual apogee, such pulchritude and distinction. Watch her shoulders ache suddenly as she plays piano en-scene, as her stock-in-trade matinee idol grasps her from behind wantonly. Watch her match wits with Lewis Stone, tonight her spy-master. Watch Garbo in the third act climb the hospital stairs Adrian head-to-toe. Watch her watch her. But! if I hear Ramon Navarro one more time call her "...Mata!" I think I'd croak (her name is M-A-T-A-H-A-R-I) How many times I've seen 'Mata Hari' I'm ashamed to say. The last viewings have been in the wee hours where there reigns a sad and profound solitude. On cue Greta emerges, like Cybele, to temporarily soothe my ills. Soon, I hear a halting viola: "...I come to you Si-va! like the bayaderes dance in your sacred temples in Java...!" Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari! Mata Hari	1
6301965787:one_of_the_greatest_silent_films:nom-de-nick_"nom-de-nick"	At the tine it was unsurpassed in spectacle and scope, and has held up remarkably well, despite a few touches of typical silent overacting/heavy-handedness. Still, the 1925 Hur belongs in any collector's collection for its importance in film history. Not to mention the fact that it sealed MGM's financial future. So of course, as of this writing, the greedy oinkers at the studios haven't released it on DVD because it won't sell 4 million copies	1

A movie about a bunch of overweight kids taking over after their fat-camp is sold into the hands of a crazed lunatic is enough reason to watch, and while it's not the funniest or clever done comedy it's a great kids movie with enough laughs for us adults to enjoy along with them.

630296928X:renoir's_first_venture_into_color:mr._bloom	In Jean Renoir's introduction to this film the great master cites Rumer Godden's book The River as the greatest work of literature about English colonialism in India. I can think of at least two books that are greater, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India, and George Orwell's Burmese Days, two works of literature which seem to indicate that Britain's endeavors in India produced more harm than a few damaged human relations among the English.	1

Do you already love Michael? Then buy this movie for your collection just to have.  Andie McDowell singing about Miles, Ralph and Bradley is worth the price of the DVD all by itself.	1

Both of them are among the best Westerns ever made. Both of them had stalwart casts and scripts. Both of them had great directors, Sturges for Gunfight and John Ford for Clementine.

0790741067:anti-john_wayne:r._a_rubin	This is one of those groundbreaking films that that put the whammy on a genre; in this case, the Western can never come back.  Oaters traditionally are the realm of strong male characters righting wrong, loving their horses, and ignoring the school marm. Robert Altman, a political and cultural man of the 1960's Left simply says "horse feathers."  The hero is a corrupt bawdyhouse owner.  The school marm makes her living in a crude manner and normal everyday middle-class types don't really exist in the hardscrabble world of capitalism.	1
B00005OCQB:dental_hijinks:anyechka	This two-reeler begins in the middle of the night.  Stan is suffering from a toothache, and his problem is keeping Ollie up as well.  Nothing he does helps him, but predictably makes things even worse.  All of the commotion in their room brings short-tempered landlord Charley Hall storming in, and the boys have a violent altercation with him that sends him off fuming.  Since everything has tried and failed, there seems no recourse but to go to the dentist.  (The scene in the dentist's office was later remade in their first feature film, 1931's 'Pardon Us.')  Things don't look good here either, since all of the patients are being carried out on stretchers.  Stan resists going in, but is dragged there anyway.  He's terrified of having the tooth pulled, and to calm him, Ollie says he'll show him how easy it is.  Unfortunately, the dentist, who was asked to leave the room during this, tells his assistant he's done for the day and to go in and pull the tooth of the guy in the chair.  Ollie ends up being snuck up on and chloroformed, with his tooth the one that's pulled.  Ollie is so furious that he gets into a scuffle with Stan, and during this they release laughing gas from one of the tubes.  The two of them begin laughing hysterically, and soon two of the nurses are laughing as well.  (The theme of starting to laugh and then getting more and more carried away and hysterical was to be revisited in a few of their other films, such as 'Blotto.')  The boys are still laughing up a storm as they get in their car and try to drive away, causing chaos and road rage all around them, not to mention the wrath of slow-burning cop Edgar Kennedy.  This is a solid comedy all around, with not a dull or wasted moment, and a great combination of both physical and situational comedy.  It's also a fascinating look back at how dentistry was conducted in the Twenties.  Today dentists use Novacaine instead of laughing gas and chloroform, and it's no longer routine procedure to just pull teeth that are giving one a problem instead of just drilling the cavity or infected area out and putting a filling in	1
B00004RNSZ:a_great_movie_but_is_it_the_same_as_the_theatrical_release?:brian_martin_"foliowyrm"	I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.	1
0783205856:amazing:h._a_brings	This is one of my favorite movies ever. It really captures life in the 1800's slums and you really get attached to the characters. There are parts that you can barely watch because you feel for the characters. This is a great story about people who hit rock bottom and become much stronger people by becoming tougher and working their way up again to achieve their dreams. I've seen this movie about 3 times and each time I see it, it is just as good	1

B000035P78:hey,_whatcha_doin'_girl?:stanley_runk_"runkdapunk"	Friday Foster may not be Foxy Brown, but it's well worth your time if you're into this genre.  It does have a catchy little theme song!  It doesn't have alot of the action and violence of other Grier films, it's more about unravelling a conspiracy.  Jim Backus is given high billing, but only appears in one scene.  Carl Weathers is at the bottom of the billing, but appears in most of the film-But that's a good thing, coz who doesn't like Carl Weathers?  Yaphet Koto, as usual, is a joy, and actually gets a few laughs.  For those like myself who occasionally fantasize coming home from work to find a naked Pam Grier in the kitchen making goulash, will enjoy the two topless scenes.  Foster sure has no problem jumping into the sack with people in this one.  Basically all I can say about Friday Foster is that it's a sure bet if you dig Pam Grier and/or blaxploitation movies.  I know I dig	1

6302860156:great_on_many_levels:chris_gibbs	This is one of the great Westerns: strong cast in every role, straighforward plot, glorious locale, and lots of hard riding and fast shooting.  For fun, see it as the middle film in a trilogy of Viet Nam-related Westerns.  "Magnificent Seven" is first (all ideology and victory assured), "Ulzana's Raid" is third (everybody's burnt out and savage and nobody wins); "The Professionals" in the middle.  A wicked, wealthy Texan (Ralph Bellamy in the same kind of hat LBJ used to wear when he was on the ranch pretending to herd cattle) hires a small band of highly skilled, experienced professionals (think Green Berets) to rescue his wife (the Viet Namese peasants) from the wicked Jack Palance (the VC).  They do the job, but it turns out the wife really loves her "abductor" and prefers him to the Texan, so the professionals return her to her lover and her home, and, "going native," go back with them.  Or you can skip all that and just enjoy the hell out of this fabulous movie	1
0790743353:you_want_a_sock_on_the_button?:rocco_dormarunno	Cagney's startling performance as Tommy Powers, in William Wellman's PUBLIC ENEMY, was to be expected. He was powerful when needed. Gentle, with his short jabs of affection. And his fast-talking wit, whether in anger or in good-spirits, was in amazing contrast to his relatively slower talking co-stars. Or was it to be expected in 1931? I didn't know until watching the commentaries around this film that co-star Edward Woods was supposed to be the lead, and that Cagney was to play Matt. At the last minute, in movie minutes, the roles were switched. And yet both actors were beyond comfortable with their new parts. (Edward Woods was incredibly underrated. Does anybody know why he quit making movies in 1938? He lived for decades after that.)	1

630290918X:one_of_allen's_masterpieces:wayne_klein_"read_my_dvd_reviews_at_dvdivas.net"	A comedy with a bitter sweet edge, "The Purple Rose of Cario" has a fairly simple premise. Cecilia (Mia Farrow) struggles to make ends meet during the Great Depression. Her husband Monk (Danny Aiello)is a lout who cheats on her and gambles since losing his job and Cecilia has to work in a restaurant and take in laundry to meet their bills and rent. The only escape that Cecilia has is going to the movies--the fantasy world of Hollywood gives her a coccoon from the brutal real world. Her favorite movie "The Purple Rose of Cario" featuring Gil Shepard (Jeff Daniels) as Tom Baxter (also Jeff Daniels in a dual role)changes her life when the character Tom Baxter walks out of the movie into the real world. He says he's in love with her and wants her to be happy something no one else except Cecilia's sister cares about. The rest of the characters in the film (Edward Herrman,Milo O'Shea, Deboarh Rush, Zoe Caldwell, John Wood, Van Johnson)are pretty upset and end up sparing with the audience watching them on screen when they complain how boring the movie is.	1

6301087771:why_the_blazes_isn't_this_show_on_dvd???:j._crutchley	This was the best series on television in the late 1980's.  My sister and I never missed an episode.  Yet it still isn't on DVD.  I can buy "I Love Lucy" and "Dawson's Creek," but I can't have all three seasons of my beloved Vincent and his velvet-over-gravel voice.  What the heck gives?  Please put this out on DVD!!	1

B00003GPG2:wonderful_crawford_and_huston:carly	the first time i saw the film was when i saw it in the sale in virgin mega stores.so i picked it up and  put it on straight away a soon as i got home and i was totally amazed with Crawfords wonderful performance and also was amazed with Hustons performance too.in RAIN Crawford plays a prostertute called sadie tompson , who has ran away form her old life in  san francisco.but as soon as she arrives at this hotel at pongo pongo she already gets into trouble as soon as she  enters the hotel by this preachers wife .but later she has a run in with the preacher (huston). which isn't  good for her . huston  hypnotises her with prayers and it makes her want to go to san francisco.but huston in the ends slashes his throat and sadie turns back to normal.its one of the best films crawford has ever made	1
6304429711:a_great_introduction_to_clint_eastwood_and_to_westerns:jessica_lux-baumann_"lagizma"	Not being a fan of Westerns, I figured I would watch ten minutes of this movie and move on.  The opening scene completely sucked me in, though, and the movie took off from there.  The movie opens with Eastwood being lynched by a band of nine men who incorrectly believed he had stolen their friend's cattle.  Eastwood is left to die, only rescued by a marshal who takes him to jail, where his story is verified by the judge, and Eastwood gets a job as a marshal.  His intention, of course, is to bring the nine men tried to take his life to justice.  The action in the movie consists of Eastwood kicking some major lawbreaker butt, all while looking ruggedly handsome with a trademark glare.	1
B00000INCN:_teenage_wasteland!:billy_c_bowden_"jett"	There are buttered-up popcorn movies that entertain you, score a ticket to "Jurassic Park" and Spielberg for that, and there are films with gravitas, that move you, disturb you, drag you to the altar kicking and screaming, to consider circumstances you might not brave yourself.."Badlands," Terrence Malick's 1973 directorial debut, an overlooked jewel of a film, forcibly moves you, and takes an unsavory subject, the Charles Starkweather serial killings' crime spree, up in the vacated Badlands of South Dakota, and refines it til you posit, "How did we get here as a country? What went wrong?"..And then you appraise the challenges a film-maker overcomes to project the psychopathic wrath of two teenagers (Martin Sheen as Kit Carruthers, Sissy Spacek as Holly Sargis) on a thrill-killing "honeymoon", onto the silver screen and make it empathetic, palatable..Why would anyone care in the first place about two low-life, lost highway delinquents, who shoot a parent, assume they can get away consequence-free, and move on with their careless lives like nothing more infractious than cutting an afternoon civics class has occurred?..However, "Badlands" is rooted in unfortunate fact, these inexplicable events happened to a pedestrian populace in North America, and Malick lets you tag along in this teenage angst riddled odyssey, deeper and deadlier into an American wasteland..The film is palpable evil genuis, arguably a top ten American film classic, irrespective it was shot by a first time director, with an unknown cast.."Badlands" resonates with gritty authenticity, cinematic style, fierce inhumanity, and the most haunting musical score (Erik Satie's Gymnopedies 3) that underwrites a Sissy Spacek voice over narration, spoken in a lazy monotone like a detached schoolgirl explaining away her unexcused absence in the principal's office, when in fact Holly (Sissy Spacek) is the fractured other half of the Kit Carruthers' killing machine, a bossom buddy in crime..Some films are purposefully pure entertainment, escapist faire.."Badlands" on the other hand is rare art, belongs in a museum	1

6301105915:devastating:j._allen_"reasonbran234@aol.com"	"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold" gets inside your veins like cold, bullying ice and by the end of the movie you feel numb.  Based on the famous novel by John Le Carre, director Martin Ritt seems determined to reveal the ugly reality of espionage (on both sides of the Iron Curtain) as it really was.	1
B00005UWBH:putting_all_there:b._grimstrup	Having watched this DVD only once all i can say is it has lived up to the expectations i was expecting .The tour de force of Sondheims music is fun and the numbers are well executed.  The highlight for me was Carol Burnett and the hilarious performance of "Everyone needs a Maid" Only Carol could perform this number with a touch of mad humour.	1
6302668603:oh,_so_so_passionate_and_a_true_story_too:margaret_t._sacco_"film_fanatic"	Not since "Duel in the Sun" has there been so much passion and lust on the screen. The king is so totally obsessed with one of his subject's wives that he loses everything to possess her.The king nurses his beloved back to health when she developes smallpox. The king's tenderness and loving care in these scenes are absolutely precious. When the king is dying the object of his obsession realizes that she loves him. However, it is too late for both of  them. The movie is so erotic yet there is not any graphic depiction of sex. The sets and costumes are absolutely gorgeous.	1
B000083C8Y:wasabi_:deanna_m._tennyson	This is a great movie! Wasabi is about a police detective (played by Reno) who has to travel to Tokyo in order to sort out his past when he learns that the only woman he has ever loved has died. If you are a big fan of Jean Reno you will really enjoy this movie. It has a great combination of action and humor and is a good addition to a movie collection. I highly recommend this film if you are looking for a mixture of action and fun, especially if you are a fan of anything by Jean Reno	1
B000051WDY:fun_ensemble_flick!:kathryn_j._blake_"k.j._blake_2"	This arty quirky film about a New Years Eve gone wrong in the mid- 80s is one of my favorites. Was the first time I saw Kate Hudson and she is so sweet and funny in this one.	1

They're lost in the Libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car, almost no water and a busted compass. Sergeant Kelly started out with Corporal Spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol. Three German fighters changed things. Now there's only Sergeant Kelly, Spence and four others.	1
B000009EI9:excellent_rabbit_fantasy!:s._boyson_"sue"	I Love this story for my Boys. It is now a story I put on for my Grandson. It keeps their attention and there is always something going on. I do wish that the few Cuss words that were put in this movie had been ommitted. You should explain that this has nothing to do with your Religous Beliefs. It is really entertaining. I Love the Bird and I Love the Song Bright Eyes. I would recommed this for anyone 8 and up. I don't think girls care for it as much as boys.	1

6304437242:sir_gielgud_steals_the_show.:oldzapatos	As others have noted, Arthur is a delightful comedy taken from the 1930s screwball "My Man Godfrey" genre. It is an effectively told, outlandish story that winds up succeeding despite some dodgy jokes and an overabundance of lukewarm sympathies.	1

It was scary back then, even with limited special effects and no graphic details. Watching it now was very enjoyable I found myself going back in time. This film is in its own right a science fiction classic.	1

0790732068:this_is_education_at_its_best:l._n._cockerham_"professor_of_humanities"	So much is unknown about the valid attempts African-Americans made to build their own society's, during the 18th century, forward.  This story tells of how they were thwarted and destroyed for 'just trying to live in America as free, productive, people.'  My classes sat with eyes glued to the screen.  It was a horrific awakening for many of my students. They were fed the lies and propaganda throughout their educations and lives, that African-Americans were a useless species.  Well, they now know the truth.  African-Americans were very diligent in building businesses, places of worship, homes, etc., which frightened the Cacausion people of that era, so they were destroyed - and much hope with them.	1

6303077781:bresson_at_his_restrained_best:trevor_willsmer	A Man Escaped is one of those films that improves with repeat viewings. Bresson makes a strange choice in omitting the opening chapter of the memoir the film is based on which deals with the hero's curiously distant emotional response to killing a collaborator, which does throw some light on the sudden apathy and inertia that paralyses him once he is on the brink of making his much-delayed escape, but in other respects it's a perfectly contained and executed movie.	1
630298971X:ready_to_jinga?:mr._snrub	It's flat out amazing -and utterly utterly unfair- that Mark Dacascos didn't become a huge star in 1993 when ONLY THE STRONG was released. It was released horrid reviews from leading critics (I'm looking at you Roger Ebert!!!!) and managed to amass only $2 million in domestice gross. And for reasons that fail to make sense on any level, CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE got to take in over $100 million. You must be joking.	1
B00004R69G:kentucky_fried_idiots:ace_preston_"ace_preston"	This movie is so stupid it is funny.  I saw it when it first came out and I still haven't forgotten it nor will I ever. This is what the writers of the Groove Tube, Saturday Night Live, and Second City Television are all about.  Watch this film and see a true comedy classic.  Individual skits like "Catholic High School Girls in Trouble" could have been made into a full length movie all to itself.  It was an era where one didn't have to be politically correct.  This is what comedy is all about.  Forget the garbage we see today.  Forget Martin Lawrence or Cedric the Entertainer.  See Kentucky Fried Movie and you will see what comedy is suppose to be or what it once was.  Oh, by the way, Stephen Bishop also has a cameo role in this film and he isn't singing "On and On"	1
B00004R6ER:on_a_tributary_of_the_amazon:kevin_killian	We had the pleasure of seeing this the other night in San Francisco at the Castro Theater, in dual projection 3-D against a silver screen.  Flimsy little glasses were provided to help blend the images poppped out onto the screen by the twin projectors.  It must have cost a mint just to stage this show, but happily the event was packed with like minded Creature lovers and everyone cheered, ooeh and aahed as soon as the Brazilian diggers uncover, in a solid block of limestone, the skeletonized hand of a long dead Creature, its webbed fingers beckoning right out over the audience's heads!  It was a powerful punch to the solar plexus and a reminder that even archaeology has its thrills.	1

B00004CJ3E:just_like_the_romans:g_p_kelly	I saw this movie when I was a student of Latin literature and thought it captured the spirt of Plautus's plays brilliantly.  Later, I saw a stage prodction which I liked as well.  But no one can replace Zero Mostel.  He is one of the most naturally funny men in the world.  This is vulgar and bawdy and even corny at times but it is lots of fun.  It is one of my favourite comedy movies of all time.	1
0764005693:a_4__1/2_star_review:martin_boucher	Darkness (for those who wonder what the title film means) is not the only time of the day TENEBRE's would-be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best-selling author's latest creation.  Before you can even say what the--, this 1982 horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair.  Never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast.  With a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer-score to boost, TENEBRE is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must-see.  Undoubtedly one of the best efforts of Dario Argento's career.-----Martin Bouche	1
B00004WIBZ:huge_hit!:h._d._martin	For those of you with endless episodes of Blue's Clues on your DVR or TiVo, this movie is the perfect addition to your collection...not to mention, it's nice to have something different to play.  My nearly 2 year old hated this movie at first - she didn't like Steve - but now she will ONLY watch Steve and absolutely adores this movie.  It's got everything that the 22 minute tv show has...just in an extended version.  We are constantly signing the songs from the movie, which started actually out of the blue (no pun) by my daughter.  I didn't even realize she knew them so well without the movie playing...but at dinner one night she just started signing "hey hey - shobadee ay - beep bop bay - hey hey".	1
6300182320:what_a_laugh!:s._taylor	This movie is absolutely ridiculous!  I'm a super musical fan and I had a friend who kept telling me that Xanadu was a movie you couldn't turn away from whenever you caught it on tv.  Boy was he right!  The music, themes and special effects are totally 80s.  I was so pleased to see one of my all time favorites Gene Kelly as a starring character.  Olivia Newton John's love interest, Michael Beck was the guy from Warriors, another of my favorites.  This is a great movie	1
6304209312:the_best:sandman	This is a classic in every sense of the word. And like any real classic, it gets better with age. "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is a sweet, simple show with a powerful message. Every aspect of this production is great.	1
0767816625:a_pure_delight:erik_pack	A film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it. The story is simple enough, and not a whole lot happens. But there's no denying it, this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way. It's a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers, and that the film doesn't have to resort too fart jokes for an audience. Not one charachter is stereotyped. They are human, and they'll probably remind you of people you know. I applaud this kind of a movie, and I wish there would be more of them	1

There's a cycling champion, Vance Legstrong, who inspires him to succeed (wonder who that character is modeled after). 'Operation DW' is about DW having surgery to get tubes put in her ears. Some really funny stuff in this one but that's pretty much par for the course with the DW based episodes	1
6300185869:one_of_fisher's_finest_finally_on_dvd_(see_below):wayne_klein_"read_my_dvd_reviews_at_dvdivas.net"	Being released as part of a two disc, dual layered dual sided Hammer Horror set from Universal in September, "Curse of the Werewolf" features a fine performance from a very young Oliver Reed. You'll need to use the ASIN below or the webpage to find it as it isn't listed (at present) under its own title but under "Phantom of the Opera". Set in Spain (although Guy Evans source novel is set in France) Reed Plays Leon who's mother died during child birth and whose father raped the girl. Born in Christmas Day, it's clear that Leon is cursed; the baptism water boils which is not a good sign to say the least. The boy is adopted by Don Alfredo Corledo (Clifford Evans). Early on it's clear things are amiss as livestock are routinely killed whenever the moon is full.	1
B0002TSZHE:the_mother:ratna_r._susanti	This is a good alternative to the bombard of Hollywood films. It potrays beutifully and naturally the meaning of love and the loneliness of the elderly. I live in one of the Asian countries where the famili members still have strong emotional bound to one another. Watching this film, I came to realize how lonely one's life can be when one grows old in the so called modern countries. Because things are so modernized, things have got so mechanical, human relation is no exception. This happens to the mother in this film. It is so touchy to see when the mother and the father come to visit her son's family, everybody is so busy with his/her business, everybody is in a rush and in the end the two of them have to stay in a quiet house with nobody around. Their visit is not strong enough to hold people from minding his/her business.	1

B000J40G8I:everyone_is_human:andrew_koepke	This episode is a bit different than the others I have seen, although I have not yet seen all of season 2 yet.

6304147074:scary_because_it's_believable:thomas_h._fields_"cinemagic"	Life imitates art.  The main character in this movie may have seemed over the top when it was released.  But today, this movie seems almost like a documentary.  This is a true horror classic.  It's among the best of this particular genre.  Do NOT watch in on a full stomach	1
B000HL0QUQ:no_holds_barred,_irreverent,_not_for_the_easily_offended:pati	This has got to be the funniest, most warped show on cable today.  It's the ultimate show about nothing - a group of morally-deficient 20-somethings who own an Irish pub in Philadelphia.  They care about nothing but outdoing each other for attention and money.  They constantly argue over the dumbest things and come from families more dysfunctional than anyone can imagine.	1
B00009W0WH:moving_tribute_to_the_real_cowboys.:mr._stephen_kennedy_"skenn1701a"	This is not a shoot-em-up Western. If that is what you are after, stop reading right here. What this is, is a real heartfelt tribute to the cowboy. The genuine article cowboy. In particular, it charts a group of cowboys through the decline of the golden age of the cowboy, near the end of the 19th Century. Almost the whole of the first half of the movie, there is no plot to speak of, just character exposition building up the picture of the life and character that these men had. Nothing is rushed, and yet it is never dull, thanks to an intelligent script. There are humorous moments and great lines, but plenty of pathos and melancholy too, as the characters all deal with the end of an era in their own ways. We see the cowboy-turned-outlaw, the cowboy-turned-storekeeper, the cowboy-turned-floor sweeper... but most of all we see the cowboy turned into legend. As the plot kicks in, there is nothing contrived about it, but it all feeds into the central idea of examining what men do when their purpose is taken away from them.	1
B00004RO1G:"a_hard_land_that_the_sun_has_sucked_all_the_good_out_of":eddie_lancekick_"a_regulator"	Make no mistake; "Chato's Land" is a sprawling, unforgiving environment that offers little water and no reward.  The blistering, sprawling landscape of rock and sagebrush, however, is but a backdrop in this story that shows man at his most ugly of moments.	1
B000KE1PBY:baseball_fans_will_enjoy_this_one:christina_brown	'The Curse of the Grebes' is sort of a tribute to the Red Sox return to World Series glory with cameos by Damon, Timlin and Renteria. Timlin actually does a great acting job and even recites a poem by Emily Dickinson with remarkable aplomb. 'Arthur Changes Gears' is also great, he gets a bike he's been coveting for a while but when he finally gets it he's so worried about getting it dirty that he won't ride it	1

6301824393:entertaining_to_a_point:j._walker	I have owned Wild Orchid for quite a few years and from the beginning thought it was a bit out there. Some of it doesn't fit, some of it doesn't make sense and some of it is just plain dumb. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like Mickey Rourke. Even though he does look at bit beat up in this movie and kind of scary looking at first with the slicked down hair he is practically oozing sex. Carre Otis's character, Emily, seems a bit aloof and childlike. She is bombarded by scenes of people having sex in an abandoned building, watching 2 people have sex in a limo. Wheeler (Mickey Rourke) almost seems to enjoy watching Emily squirm a bit. Wheeler is sort of detached, but wanting someone he can trust. Its tough to make sense of this movie because honestly the best part is the end. Now I have the unrated version so it shows more than the R-rating (for a movie like this one - unrated or NC-17 is the way to go)-the part where Wheeler and Emily make love finally. It is very arousing to say the least. I must give it to Zalman King. He knows how far to go to where the movie gets into your mind, but yet he doesn't go for the gratuitous sex. I suggest Delta of Venus, which is another Zalman King experience	1

1574925903:best_possible_sequel_made_to_the_original!!!!!!!!!:bob_bob	First of all, I would have to say is I am deeply moved my this movie. Let me tell all of your Lonesome Dove fans something, DON'T LISTEN TO THERE INSULTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, first of all, we don't have TLJ nor Angelica Houston. Those two characters were the major characters in LD next to Gus. But, there is Jon Voight to play Call. Voight may not be the one born for Call like TLJ, but he still does an excelent job and no one except TLJ could have played it better. Barbara Hershey plays Clara. I think she captured the essence of Clara and she did a good job. Rick Shroeder is back and he does a truly unforgetable job as Newt. July Johnson is back along with Pea Eeye. There are some new characters like former texas ranger Gideon Walker, Gus's daughter Agostina Vega, the villian Cheeroke Jack, and a man named Isom who resembles the role of "deets". Although people say that this plot is the same, they are right, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. Just because Mcmurty doesn't write doesn't mean it sucks. It captured the essence that the origianl caught. It had the same beautiful background music. There was a lot of action and adventure and the best part was, the story continued right after Call buried Gus. If you want to have an accurate depiction on what happens to the characters in the original, RTLD definitly shows it. Streets of Laredo is nothing compared to this. This is the true sequel because it delivers the same joy to your heart just like the original. I reccomend this movie to anyone who loves LD and wants to know the continuation of the story. This movie is truly a western. THE EPIC AS BIG AS THE WEST CONTINUES!!!!!!!!!!!	1
B00005Y7M4:a_fascinating_slice_of_pennsylvanian_coal_mining_history_:joseph_p._tevington	The more historically accurate the film, the more it tends to drag.  The Molly Maguires certainly passes this test!  Still, it presents a fascinating account of an oppressed people and a wrong-headed response which brought them into conflict with the Church	1

B000MWJFJ8:great_quality:c._williams	There is a good reason you'd want to buy this from Amazon. The quality. Sure, you can watch it for free on CBS, but the quality isn't very good. It's streamed and the bitrate (quality) is low. Personally, I want to watch Survivor on my 50" plasma, not on my computer screen. So, I use Unbox + Windows Media Center to make that happen. Survivor from unbox is as good as getting the show directly from my cable provider.	1
6302485053:top_movie:l._compostella_"zombie_freak"	I saw this movie when I was about 15 or 16 and that was a long time ago.  I ordered a copy through Amazon and when I watched it I remembered everything in the film especially Queenie hiding in the woods. I like this as it was directed by Charles Kaufman, brother of Lloyd Kaufman who made the Toxic Avenger. I give this film a rating of 5 stars and as it is a Troma Inc. release, this is one of the best Troma films I have seen	1
B00004R6CP:the_wrong_arm_of_the_law:andrew_g._st_butler_"andrew"	This film really shows the versatility of Peter Sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting. This is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch. The quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source. Frankly you forget that it is  in black and white format	1
B0001BKAYY:simply_beautiful:michael_dennis_"reelblack.com"	BUY this DVD today.  Be sure to purchase the boxset as it is the only way to get the RICHARD PRYOR SPECIAL? and Mudbone bonus footage.  This groundbreaking series paved the way for not only (the obvious) IN LIVING COLOR and CHAPPELLES SHOW, but other subversive TV like South Park which attempt to inject social commentary while challenging the censors.  It not only captures Pryor at his comedic peak, but gives us early glimpses of folks like Robin Williams, Sandra Berhard, Marsha Warfield and John Witherspoon.  This show has never been available on home video and has basically been out of circulation since its initial run, thus it is a jewel to behold.  Watching Pryor as &quot;The &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;the First Black President&quot; and &quot;Rev. White&quot;--who has his own way to drum up &quot;the big bucks&quot;-- will have you laffing for hours.  But  Pryor also presents scketches that weren't designed to be laugh out loud funny, but challenge you in other ways, like the wino sketch that turns into a Maya Angelo performance. Or the &quot;Satin Doll&quot;  sketch, which has no laughs at all, but aims to capture the feeling of post WWII Black america with a fantastic song-and-dance number starring Paula Kelly (choreographed by Michael Peters.)  I seriously doubt these five hours of television would have come out the same if the NBC censors had been completely undertanding, sensitive and supportive of Mr. Pryor's vision.  The Special is an extension of Mr. Pryor's hosting of SNL. The  subsequent series itself reminds me of Marvin Gaye's HERE, MY DEAR. While it is not Marvin's most listenable or even best work, through pain he finds beauty and truth.  This boxset is a must-have for fans of TV comedy and shoud be copped by any means necessary	1
630528220X:thats_my_boys!!!:f._j._eckert_"nitro_buzzsaw"	Hello world,Wowee zowee, very "wacky" little gem. Remember seeing the cover when my Dad took me into the video store, I was around 6 or 7 and it stuck in my mind. When I was about 21 or 22 one of my friends flat buddies had it on Beta tape, so I borrowed it cause I still have a Beta(really shouldn't have mentioned that). A true slasher basher not for the timid, truly written and directed by booby hatch patients, and were they found the actors is beyond me! Filmed in georgeous New Jersey of course not far from the original Friday the 13th. Its a real winner!!! Creepiest Mom ever. Love her old dodge or plymouth?	1
B000HAB4SU:firefly_is_worthy_of_your_download!:mavourneen	The cancellation of this short lived but highly acclaimed series is perhaps the biggest mistake made by a network. Ever.	1
B000NV1TCY:smart,_funny,_scary_show:l._leeman	Veronica Mars is my favorite show currently on television. Although the show has been focusing more on Veronica's romantic relationship than in the past, the mystery aspect is still front and center each episode. The writers incorporate smart dialoge and clever plot twists to create a genuinely funny and suspenseful show. The acting for the most part is top notch, and Kristen Bell, who plays Veronica, is amazing. I especially enjoyed Episode 9, Spit and Eggs, in which Veronica figures out who has raped her fried Parker and at least two other women on her campus.	1
B000MVN8FG:much_cooler_than_i_expected.:palyne_gaenir	This is a surprisingly good show. It manages to have 'a little' violence, sex, and language but not enough to be too offensive to watch with my kid, and it's still intelligent enough to be interesting, humorous and kind of addicting to an adult. A modern Nancy Drew, is Veronica Mars. I wish seasons 1 and 2 were here; I wish anything more were here and I'd get that as well. I'm really not even much of a whodunit kind of fan to be honest, I prefer science fiction but amazon ran out of decent TV to sell me in that genre so I bought VM season 3 just for kicks. I'm glad I did	1

She wakes up one morning next to a guy with a knife in his chest and she can't remember what happened the night before. Then she is on the run when she meets a sympathetic young man played by Jeff Bridges.Unlike Hitchcock movies when the violins start to screetch on the soundtrack then you knw something VERY BAD is going to happen. The violins in this movie play pretty loud but nothing happens. I figured out "Whodunnit" in the first 30 minutes of this film and then spent the next hour trying to figure out if Fonda's hair was a wig or did she get her own hair bleached blonde?I give this movie 5 stars because I liked the look of the loft where the dead guy lives	1
B00000FBHR:9_years_ago_i_saw_this_and_it_still_takes_my_breath_away...:melian_daily	Words cannot express how glad I am the Adventures in Motion Pictures company made available Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake on DVD. The clich thing to say is it's "amazing", "genius", "sexy", "masterful"... but it is all those things and more. You've never see anything like this.	1
6302305934:cd_version_necessary_to_understand_fame/power_karma:lela_soulier_"galadriel"	If you are interested in knowing what challenges monarches and other powerful people face, this movie is a great beginning. You may or may not be interested in Russian history or even world history, but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional, physical and political issues faced by two powerfully-born adults and their children. Other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses, so I will not go into too much detail to "sell" anybody on the action or dialogue, or historical accuracy. Suffice to say this movie -- in its unedited version (crucial for DVD) does in fact tell it like it is (or was). Nicholas and Alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the Western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the 20th century. They were responsible, in an almost Biblical sense, for the destiny of Humanity, only they opted out, and were then executed. This would be considered "romantic" if Humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for Leadership by designated heroes. The DVD version is critical to see the full relationship between Alexandria and Rasputin as a surrendering of power, and also to see Rasputin in his full decadent expression (which must be positively repulsive to Russian history revisionists.) It is also necessary, in an emotional and historic context, to see the "failure" of Nicholas -- that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead. It is also relevant to see the execution of Rasputin at the hands of the two hop-head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead, and that they themselves had dreams of American incorporation. Alexia (Nicholas and Alexandra's only son, who also happened to be a hemophiliac) hates his persecutors with a very personal, adult hatred -- those who persecuted the Romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised. They loved their leaders, and despised their need for leaders. If you purchase this movie, whatever your reason or interest, please buy the DVD so that it is unedited (meaning uncensored) so thatyou may judge for yourself	1
6301969294:about_25%_of_the_book...:m._sebourn	But it's the core 25%, and if you look at this as its own piece, then you'll be satisfied.  The visuals are great, Gary Cooper is great, and Ayn Rand's premise is all here.	1
6304501978:italians_do_it_better-just_ask_sophia!:eric_marshall	Sophia Loren is without arugment the most beautiful and sexy foreign actress in movie history. Beginning in the mid-1950's she did a string of Italian films and became the first foreign-born actress to come to Hollywood and make the crossover in mainstream American movies, starting with "The Pride and the Passion" in 1957 (it was this film and "Houseboat" that Loren began her close relationship with Cary Grant) and at the same time, blew fellow Italian bella Gina Lollobridga out of the water as the best actress to come out of Italy. In 1960, Loren went back to Italy to film the World War II film "Two Women." A year and a half later, to everybody's surprise she won the Oscar for Best Actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the Academy Award. But if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy Sophia Loren was, it came with "Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow." The scene in which she strips in front of Marcello Mastronini's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too (Hope PREMIERE magazine does a list like it someday). And that is the scene in which you say to everybody, "This is Sophia Loren." In my opinion, Loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on-screen in their lingerie. There is a shirt that says, "Italians Do it Better." Could 'it' be referring to sex? if so, we can give thanks to Sophia Loren.	1
B00004RRM6:awesome_movie_for_entire_family:m._letteer	This movie is a classic.  We owned it on VHS and the tape finally fell apart, so I ordered it for our family for Christmas.  Good for all ages, nice night of entertainment for all of us	1
B000062XLU:adorable!:	Monkey Business is one of the cutest movies I have ever seen and it's just so funny to see Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers take the youth serum and act like children and they were great and also the monkey were absolutely adorable!	1
